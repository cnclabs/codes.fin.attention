the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in the company s filings with the sec could affect the company financial performance and could cause the company actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the company does not undertake and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed assets the company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
in addition  the bank s regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process 
the bank latest annual regulatory examination was completed in december additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in the financial statements contained in this report  management overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
in addition  the company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets 
while the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties  the amount that the company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements  resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
carrying value of fdic covered loans and indemnification asset the company considers that the determination of the carrying value of loans acquired in the fdic assisted transactions and the carrying value of the related fdic indemnification assets involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of the acquired loans and the fdic indemnification assets reflect management s best ongoing estimates of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets 
the company determined initial fair value accounting estimates of the assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations 
however  the amount that the company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements  based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods 
because of the loss sharing agreements with the fdic on these assets  the company should not incur any significant losses 
to the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates  the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the fdic 
subsequent to the initial valuation  the company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools  anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield 
analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment 
see note of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the company s reporting units compared with its carrying value 
the company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed 
as of december   the company has one reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  further testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
at december   goodwill consisted of  at the bank reporting unit 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to seven years 
at december   the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of million 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value 
see note of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company used a market approach to value its reporting unit 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit  to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment may include developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
based on the company s goodwill impairment testing  management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of december  while the company believes no impairment existed at december   different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of the reporting unit  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the company s impairment evaluation in the future 
current economic conditions current economic conditions present financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges which  in some cases  have resulted in large declines in the fair value of investments and other assets  constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems  including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans 
the company s financial statements are prepared using values and information currently available to the company 
given the volatility of current economic conditions  the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly  resulting in material future adjustments in asset values  the allowance for loan losses  or capital that could negatively impact the company s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
recent economic conditions have impacted the markets in which we operate 
throughout our market areas  the economic downturn beginning in negatively affected consumer confidence and elevated unemployment levels 
recently there have been signs of increasing optimism and economic activity 
unemployment levels across our market areas have decreased 
the missouri unemployment rate declined during the year ended december  from at december  to at december   and was below the national average of at december  the iowa and kansas unemployment rates also declined during the year ended december  from and at december   respectively  to and at december   respectively 
the st 
louis market area continues to carry the highest level of unemployment among our market areas  with unemployment rates at  and at december  and  respectively  but is still below national levels 
job creation in the st 
louis market  while positive  remains sluggish 
the unemployment rate for the springfield market area was below the national average  at at december  average prices for existing home sales in the midwest  which includes our market areas  increased in over according to the national association of realtors 
building permits have increased across our market areas while foreclosure filings have plunged to their lowest level since april according to cnnmoney 
these improvements are anticipated to continue throughout commercial real estate markets also improved substantially in the company s markets 
vacancy rates continued to fall with a notable improvement in sales  absorption and rents 
according to real estate services firm  costar group  retail  office and industrial types of commercial real estate properties had vacancy rates that averaged  and  respectively  in the company s primary markets for these vacancy rates in the company s primary markets remain slightly elevated from averages of  and  respectively  for  prior to the economic downturn but have shown continued improvement over the past two years 
national averages were  and  respectively  for  still elevated from  and for  according to the costar group 
increased vacancy rates for commercial real estate properties correlate to fewer commercial land development sales because of the risk involved in developing these types of properties when completed properties have vacancies 
loan types specifically impacted in the company s loan portfolio over the past years include residential and commercial land development  segments of the commercial real estate portfolio and condominium development in the st 
louis  central missouri and branson market areas 
overall lending activity has increased somewhat but is still below historic levels 
general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income  as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non interest income and non interest expense 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   great southern total assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided in the comparison of financial condition at december  and december  section of this annual report on form k 
loans 
in the year ended december   great southern net loans increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the loans acquired in the interbank fdic assisted transaction during which totaled million at december  excluding loans covered by loss sharing agreements  commercial real estate loans increased million  or  other commercial loans increased million  or  consumer auto loans increased million  or  and multi family residential loans increased million  or 
commercial construction loans also increased  but the increase was primarily offset by decreases in subdivision construction and land development loans 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the and fdic assisted transactions of million  or  primarily because of loan repayments  and a decrease in the loans acquired in the interbank transaction since the acquisition date of million  primarily because of loan repayments 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
the net loan growth in certain loan categories experienced during the year ended december   excluding the interbank fdic assisted transaction  may continue into however  based upon the current lending environment and economic conditions  the company does not expect to grow the overall loan portfolio significantly at this time 
the company strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
of the total loan portfolio at december  and  and  respectively  was secured by real estate  as this is the bank s primary focus in its lending efforts 
at december  and  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the bank an opportunity to increase the yield on  and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in its portfolio 
they do  however  present somewhat greater risk to the bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally 
at december  and  loans made in the springfield  mo 
metropolitan statistical area springfield msa were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
the company s headquarters are located in springfield and we have operated in this market since because of our large presence and experience in the springfield msa  many lending opportunities exist 
however  if the economic conditions of the springfield msa were worse than those of other market areas in which we operate or the national economy overall  the performance of these loans could decline comparatively 
at december  and  loans made in the st 
louis  mo 
metropolitan statistical area st 
louis msa were and of the bank s total loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions  respectively 
the company s expansion into the st 
louis msa in may provided an opportunity to not only expand its markets and provide diversification from the springfield msa  but also provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition 
loans made in the st 
louis msa are primarily commercial real estate  commercial business and multi family residential loans which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates  as mentioned above under current economic conditions  than if the focus were on one to four family residential and consumer loans 
for further discussions of the bank s loan portfolio  and specifically  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans  see item business lending activities 
the percentage of fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio excluding loans acquired through fdic assisted transactions has increased from in to in due to customer preference for fixed rate loans during this period of low interest rates 
of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio  mature within one to five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long term interest rate risk for the company 
fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy 
as of december   our internal interest rate risk models indicated a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is fairly neutral 
for further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk how we measure the risks to us associated with interest rate changes 
for discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes  see risk factors we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
while our policy allows us to lend up to of the appraised value on single family properties and up to on two to four family residential properties  originations of loans with loan to value ratios at that level are minimal 
when they are made at those levels  private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the level or our analyses determined minimal risk to be involved and therefore these loans are not considered to have more risk to us than other residential loans 
we consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size 
at december  and december   an estimated and  respectively  of total owner occupied one to four family residential loans had loan to value ratios above at origination 
at december  and december   an estimated and  respectively  of total non owner occupied one to four family residential loans had loan to value ratios above at origination 
at december  troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total loans  down million from million  or of total loans  at december  at december   troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total loans 
at december   troubled debt restructurings totaled million  or of total loans 
at december   the company had no loans that were modified in troubled debt restructurings 
this increase over the past five years is primarily due to the economic downturn and the resulting increased number of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection 
while the types of concessions made have not changed as a result of the economic recession  the number of concessions granted has increased as reflected in the increase in troubled debt restructurings 
during the year ended december   eleven loans totaling million were each restructured into multiple new loans 
during the year ended december   twelve loans totaling million were each restructured into multiple new loans 
during the year ended december   four loans totaling million were each restructured into multiple new loans 
for further information on troubled debt restructurings  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
the loss sharing agreements with the fdic are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered  and are conditioned upon the bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the fdic  including requirements regarding servicing and other loan administration matters 
the loss sharing agreements extend for ten years for single family real estate loans and for five years for other loans 
at december   approximately six years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from teambank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of two to eleven years 
at december   approximately seven years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from vantus bank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of two to thirteen years 
at december   approximately nine years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from sun security bank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of four to eleven years 
at december   approximately nine years remain on the loss sharing agreement for single family real estate loans acquired from interbank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of seven to fourteen years 
at december   approximately one year remains on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from teambank and the remaining loans are have an estimated average life of one to five years 
at december   approximately two years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from vantus bank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of two to five years 
at december   approximately four years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from sun security bank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of one to two years 
at december   approximately four years remain on the loss sharing agreement for non single family loans acquired from interbank and the remaining loans have an estimated average life of three to eight years 
while the expected repayments for certain of the acquired loans extend beyond the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the bank has identified and will continue to identify problem loans and will make every effort to resolve them within the time limits of the agreements 
the company may sell any loans remaining at the end of the loss sharing agreement subject to the approval of the fdic 
acquired loans are currently included in the analysis and estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
however  when the loss sharing agreements end  the allowance for loan losses related to any acquired loans retained in the portfolio may need to increase 
the loss sharing agreements and their related limitations are described in detail in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income 
while we did not have an overall high level of charge offs on our non performing loans prior to  we generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 
we expect the loan loss provision  non performing assets and foreclosed assets will generally remain elevated and will fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  expenses related to the credit resolution process could also remain elevated 
available for sale securities 
in the year ended december   available for sale securities decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the decrease was due to net sales and repayments of mortgage backed securities which decreased million from million at december  to million at december  and securities of states and political subdivisions  which decreased million from million at december  to million at december  cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during was due to cash received from the fdic in the interbank fdic assisted transaction and proceeds from the sale and repayment of certain investments 
foreclosed assets 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  foreclosed assets  excluding those covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic  increased from million  or of total assets  at december  to million  or of total assets  at december  foreclosed assets began increasing in as the united states economy slowed due to a severe economic recession in and during  and  economic growth was slow and residential and commercial real estate markets recovered only slightly  if at all 
the levels of net additions to foreclosed assets during remained elevated 
because sales of foreclosed properties have been slower than additions  total foreclosed assets increased in each of the last four years 
the trend of higher additions and lower sales due to the economy is magnified in the subdivision construction and land development categories where properties are more speculative in nature and market activity has been very slow 
see non performing assets foreclosed assets for additional information on the company s foreclosed assets 
deposits 
the company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with federal home loan bank fhlbank advances and other borrowings  to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of the million of core deposits assumed from interbank in the fdic assisted transaction during including the deposits assumed from interbank  interest bearing transaction accounts increased million  non interest bearing checking accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
total brokered deposits decreased million  primarily because of a reduction in deposits that are part of the cdars program 
included in total brokered deposits at december  and december   were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that are part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic considers these customer accounts to be brokered deposits due to the fees paid in the cdars program 
the company did not actively try to grow cdars customer deposits during the current period and decreased interest rates offered on these deposits during the year ended december our deposit balances may fluctuate from time to time depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding 
in  we experienced an overall increase in deposits  primarily due to the deposits assumed in the interbank fdic assisted transaction 
because of overall low loan demand and increased liquidity levels in  when compared to historic trends  we chose to allow certain types of our deposit balances to decrease 
as discussed previously regarding  this was primarily done by redeeming brokered cds without replacement and by allowing higher cost cdars accounts to decrease by offering lower rates or redeeming them 
the transition in deposit types from time deposits to transaction deposits benefits our net interest margin by generally reducing our cost of funds 
we do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty 
when loan demand begins trending upward  we can increase rates paid on deposits to increase deposit balances and may again utilize brokered deposits to provide necessary funding 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may be a negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the company s inability to lower its funding costs significantly in the current low interest rate environment  although interest rates on assets may decline further 
the interbank and other core deposits added during helped the company lower overall funding costs 
however  because market interest rates are already very low  it may be difficult for the company to further lower its funding costs significantly  while interest rates on assets may decline further 
the level of competition for deposits in our markets is high 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and retail certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
in addition  while we have been generally lowering our deposit rates over the past several quarter  increasing rates paid on deposits can help to attract deposits if needed  however  this could negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
these funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding  if desired  which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
net interest income and interest rate risk management 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by interest rate changes in the market 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate of interest and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts subject to the effect of loan interest rate floors  which are discussed below 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in addition  our net interest income may be impacted by changes in the cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools 
as described in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report  the company s evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from acquired loan pools is on going and increases in cash flow expectations are recognized as increases in accretable yield through interest income 
decreases in cash flow expectations are recognized as impairments through the allowance for loan losses 
the current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management 
the frb last changed interest rates on december  great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its great southern prime rate of interest at 
this does not affect a large number of customers  as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors which are provided for in individual loan documents 
but for the interest rate floors  a rate cut by the frb generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the federal funds rate adjusts 
loans at their floor rates are subject to the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate  however 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may also be a negative impact on the company net interest income due to the company inability to lower its funding costs significantly in the current environment  although interest rates on assets may decline further 
conversely  interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our prime based loans 
the interest rate floors in effect may limit the immediate increase in interest rates on these loans  until such time as rates rise above the floors 
however  the company may have to increase rates paid on deposits to maintain deposit balances and pay higher rates on borrowings 
the impact of the low rate environment on our net interest margin in future periods is expected to be fairly neutral 
as our time deposits mature in future periods  we expect to be able to continue to reduce rates somewhat as they renew 
however  any margin gained by these rate reductions is likely to be offset by reduced yields from our investment securities as payments are made on our mortgage backed securities and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
similarly  interest rates on adjustable rate loans may reset lower according to their contractual terms and new loans may be originated at lower market rates 
for further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk how we measure the risks to us associated with interest rate changes 
the negative impact of declining loan interest rates has been mitigated by the positive effects of the company s loans which have interest rate floors 
at december   the company had a portfolio excluding the loans acquired in the fdic assisted transactions of prime based loans totaling approximately million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million also had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
in addition  there were million of these loans with floor rates between and 
at december   all million of these loans were at their floor rates 
the loan yield for the total loan portfolio was approximately  and basis points higher than the national prime rate of interest at december   and  respectively  partly because of these interest rate floors 
while interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the company s results during this period  they do subject the company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders 
to the extent economic conditions improve  the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance their loans increases 
non interest income and operating expenses 
the company profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  accretion income net of amortization related to the fdic assisted acquisitions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
in  and  non interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the fdic assisted transactions 
in  and  increases in the cash flows expected to be collected from the fdic covered loan portfolios resulted in amortization expense recorded relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
non interest income may also be affected by the company interest rate derivative activities  if the company chooses to implement derivatives 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  expenses related to foreclosed assets  postage  fdic deposit insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
details of the current period changes in non interest income and non interest expense are provided under results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and business initiatives in  several initiatives have been completed or are underway related to the company s banking center network 
in february  the company opened a new banking center in o fallon  mo  a suburb of st 
louis 
the company now operates seven banking centers in the st 
louis metro area 
during the second quarter  the company replaced two existing banking centers with new facilities 
in april  a new banking center on west kearney in north springfield  mo  was opened replacing a leased location approximately one block east 
in may  a new banking center on west th street in olathe  kan  was opened in an established retail business district replacing the former banking site located in a lesser developed area of the city 
in october  a new banking center at w 
republic in springfield  mo  was opened  which replaced a nearby leased facility at s 
campbell 
a new banking center in greenfield  mo  was also opened in december the full service banking center replacd a previously razed drive thru facility on the same lot 
at the same time as the opening of the new facility  a leased banking center in downtown greenfield was closed 
in march  a new banking center in downtown springfield is expected to open  which replaces a leased facility two blocks away 
great southern operated from this new location at south ave 
in the s through the s 
a new full service banking center in a commercial district in omaha  neb  is under construction 
in addition to the banking center  a commercial lending team will be housed in this facility 
the facility is expected to be open in fall the company currently operates two banking centers in the omaha metropolitan area one in bellevue and one in fort calhoun 
on the technology front  in january  the company launched a new smartphone application for iphone and android users providing customers another channel for accessing their accounts 
in december  the company launched an online consumer loan application service so that customers can apply online for various consumer loans including auto  boat  recreational vehicle and home equity loans 
in january  the company introduced mobile check deposit  a smartphone application based service enabling customers to conveniently deposit a paper check to their checking account by utilizing the smartphone camera 
text banking is expected to be launched in the second quarter of providing another channel for customers to access account information 
the company reorganized its internal organizational structure during the year to more effectively serve business banking customers 
small business banking and corporate services were combined to form the business banking division  which will offer depository and lending products to customers in a more streamlined and comprehensive manner 
on november   great southern bank separately sold great southern travel and great southern insurance to milwaukee based adelman travel and st 
louis based hm  respectively 
the two sales resulted in a combined transaction gain totaling million effect of federal laws and regulations general 
federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
legislation impacting the financial services industry 
on july   sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act implements far reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape  including provisions that  among other things  centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  with broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  require new capital rules and apply to bank holding companies the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions   change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance  repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  amend the account balance limit for federal deposit insurance protection  and increase the authority of the federal reserve board to examine the company and its non bank subsidiaries 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company and the financial services industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments  and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the company and the bank could require the company and the bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future 
a provision of the dodd frank act  commonly referred to as the durbin amendment  directed the frb to analyze the debit card payments system and fix the interchange rates based upon their estimate of actual costs 
the frb has established the interchange rate for all debit transactions for issuers with over billion in assets  effective october   at per transaction 
an additional five basis points of the transaction amount and an additional may be collected by the issuer for fraud prevention and recovery  provided the issuer performs certain actions 
although the bank is currently exempt from the provisions of the rule on the basis of asset size  there is some uncertainty about the long term impact there will be on the interchange rates for issuers below the billion level of assets 
new proposed capital rules 
the federal banking agencies have proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the bank and the company 
the proposed rules would implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
basel iii refers to various documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision 
as published  the proposed rules contemplated a general effective date of january   and  for certain provisions  various phase in periods and later effective dates 
however  the federal banking agencies have announced that the proposed rules will not be effective on january  the agencies have not adopted final rules or published any modifications to the proposed rules 
the proposed rules as published are summarized below 
it is not possible to predict when or in what form final regulations may be adopted 
the proposed rules include new minimum capital ratios  to be phased in until fully effective on january   and would refine the definitions of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital ratios would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer requirement of above each of the new regulatory minimum capital ratios to be phased in starting on january  and fully effective on january  an institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if any of its capital levels fell below the capital conservation buffer amount 
the federal banking agencies also proposed revisions  effective january   to the prompt corrective action framework  which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels show signs of weakness 
under the prompt corrective action requirements  insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following in order to qualify as well capitalized i a common equity tier risk based capital ratio of  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of increased from  iii a total risk based capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of unchanged from the current rules 
the basel iii also contains provisions on liquidity include complex criteria establishing a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr 
the purpose of the lcr is to ensure that a bank maintains adequate unencumbered  high quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for days under a severe liquidity stress scenario 
the purpose of the nsfr is to promote more medium and long term funding of assets and activities  using a one year horizon 
the federal banking agencies have not published proposed regulations on these provisions of basel iii 
fdic assisted acquisition of certain assets and liabilities on april   great southern bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement  including a loss sharing agreement  with the fdic to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the deposits and other liabilities of inter savings bank  fsb interbank  a full service bank headquartered in maple grove  minn 
established in  interbank operated four locations in three counties in the minneapolis st 
paul area 
assets with a fair value of approximately million were acquired  including million of loans  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investment securities  million of foreclosed assets  and million of other assets 
liabilities with a fair value of million were assumed  including million of deposits  million of accounts payable and  of other liabilities 
a customer related core deposit intangible asset of million was also recorded 
as a result of the excess of liabilities over assets  the bank received million in cash from the fdic 
under the loss sharing agreement  the fdic has agreed to cover of the losses on the loans and foreclosed assets purchased subject to certain limitations 
the company recorded an fdic indemnification asset of million as a result of this loss sharing agreement 
the former interbank franchise is currently operating under the great southern name from its previous locations 
the bank converted the interbank operational systems into great southern s systems in august  which allows all great southern and former interbank customers to conduct business at any banking center throughout the great southern six state franchise 
the company recorded a one time gain of million pre tax based upon the initial estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations  during the year ended december  fasb asc allows a measurement period of up to one year to adjust initial fair value estimates as of the acquisition date 
the company has continued to evaluate the initial fair value estimates and  has finalized these estimates without adjustment as of december  additional income will be recognized in future periods as loans are collected from customers and as reimbursements of losses are collected from the fdic  but we cannot estimate the timing of this income due to the variables associated with this transaction 
based on the level of discounts expected to be accreted into income in future years and the loss sharing agreement with the fdic  none of the acquired interbank loans are considered non performing  as we have a reasonable expectation to recover both the discounted book balances of such loans as well as a yield on the discounted book balances 
interbank presented an attractive franchise for the company to acquire because it provided the opportunity for expansion into a new complementary market through banking centers which  for the most part  held competitive market positions in both loans and deposits 
the minneapolis st 
paul market should provide new opportunities for commercial and real estate lending  as it is a large metropolitan area with relatively low unemployment and significant business activity 
the company also benefits from reduced credit risk due to the loss sharing agreement with the fdic that was part of the transaction

sale of business units effective november   the company sold the bank great southern travel division to milwaukee  wisconsin based adelman travel and the bank great southern insurance division to st 
louis based hm 
existing great southern travel and great southern insurance employees and offices became part of each acquirer s respective operations 
the business units were sold after the company made the decision to focus its resources on its core banking business 
the operations of the two divisions have been reclassified to include all revenues and expenses in discontinued operations 
in  the company recognized gains on the sales totaling million  which are included in the income from discontinued operations 
the through operations have been restated to reflect the reclassification of revenues and expenses in discontinued operations 
revenues from the two divisions  excluding the gain on sale  totaled million  million  million  million and million for the years ended december      and  respectively  and is included in income from discontinued operations

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   total assets increased by million to billion 
the increase was primarily due to increases in loans and cash and cash equivalents  primarily attributable to the interbank fdic assisted transaction 
the increase was also due to increases in premises and equipment  partially offset by decreases in available for sale securities and prepaid expenses and other assets 
net loans increased million to billion at december   due primarily to the interbank loans acquired in the fdic assisted transaction which had a balance of million at december  commercial real estate loans increased million  or  commercial business loans increased million  or  consumer auto loans increased million  or  and multi family residential loans increased million  or 
commercial construction loans also increased  but the increase was primarily offset by decreases in subdivision construction and land development loans 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in net loans acquired through the and fdic assisted transactions of million  or  primarily because of loan repayments 
the increase in loans during was primarily due to financing loans which had been previously financed by other lenders  rather than significant overall economic improvement 
the company strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels given the current credit and economic environments 
related to the loans purchased in the  and fdic assisted transactions  the company recorded indemnification assets which represent payments expected to be received from the fdic through loss sharing agreements 
the total balance of the fdic indemnification asset increased million to million at december  the increase was due to the fdic indemnification asset recorded through the interbank fdic assisted transaction of million which was reduced million to million at december  due to amounts billed to the fdic for losses recognized 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in the fdic indemnification assets related to the and fdic assisted transactions due to payments received from the fdic as well as estimated improved cash flows to be collected from the loan obligors  resulting in reductions in payments expected to be received from the fdic 
the expected improved cash flows are further discussed in the interest income loans section below 
securities available for sale decreased million as compared to december  the decrease was due to sales and maturities of mortgage backed securities which decreased million from million at december  to million at december  and securities of states and political subdivisions  which decreased million from million at december  to million at december  while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has in recent periods been approximately to of total assets 
the available for sale securities portfolio was and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
prepaid expenses and other assets decreased million as compared to december   due to an approximately million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  primarily due a reduction in receivables from the fdic for losses covered by the loss sharing agreements of million 
offsetting this decrease was an increase of million in federal and state tax credit investments 
the majority of the increase in tax credit investments was due to investments in federal low income housing tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over a year period 
for further information on the company s investments in tax credits  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
the company s net premises and equipment increased million as compared to december  the primary reason for the increase was the purchase of approximately million of fixed assets from the fdic for the sun security branch locations  the purchase of approximately million of fixed assets from the fdic for the interbank branch locations and the addition of new locations as a result of the growth of the company and to provide for future growth 
during the year ended december   a new banking center was opened in o fallon  mo 
a new banking center in olathe  kan 
was opened which relocated an existing banking center to a more established retail business district 
in addition  a new banking center in springfield  mo 
was opened  relocating a banking center with one of the company s highest transaction volumes to provide more drive thru lanes and better access 
the company replaced a leased banking center in springfield  mo  with a new banking center less than a mile away 
the new site is a former bank office and provides greater customer access 
a new banking center was opened in greenfield  mo  which replaced a previously razed drive thru facility on the same lot  and a leased banking center downtown 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased million to million 
the increase during was due to sales and maturities of available for sale securities and the cash received from the fdic in the interbank fdic assisted transaction  partially offset by increased loan funding 
total liabilities increased million from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in deposits and current and deferred income taxes  partially offset by decreases in fhlb advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of the million of deposits assumed in the interbank fdic assisted transaction during including the deposits assumed in the interbank fdic assisted transaction  interest bearing transaction accounts increased million  non interest bearing checking accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
since the second quarter of  the company s transaction account balances have trended upward while retail certificates of deposit have trended downward because of customer preference to have immediate access to funds during the current low interest rate environment 
however  the addition of the interbank deposits in the second quarter of resulted in the increase in retail certificates of deposit at december  total brokered deposits  excluding the cdars customer accounts  were million at december   down from million at december  the decrease was the result of million of brokered deposits that matured or were called by the company during the period while no new brokered deposits were added 
at december  and  great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  were part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic counts these deposits as brokered  but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets 
fhlbank advances decreased million from december  the company elected to prepay million of fhlb advances  which were assumed as part of the sun security transaction during the first quarter of the penalties incurred to prepay these advances were primarily accounted for as part of the purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition  resulting in no additional material expense in the year ended december  the level of fhlbank advances can fluctuate depending on growth in the company loan portfolio and other funding needs and sources of funds available to the company 
most of the company s fhlbank advances are fixed rate advances that cannot be repaid prior to maturity without incurring significant penalties 
securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers decreased million from december  as these balances fluctuate over time and rates paid on these accounts decreased 
total stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   common and preferred dividends declared were million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased million 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from increases in the fair value of the company available for sale investment securities 
in addition  total stockholders equity increased million due to stock option exercises 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general net income increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net income from continuing operations increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in non interest income of million  or  and an increase in net interest income of million  or  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  or  an increase in provision for income taxes of million  or  and an increase in the provision for loan losses of million  or 
non interest income for the year ended december  included a gain recognized on business acquisition of million  and also included net amortization expense of the fdic indemnification asset of million 
net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total interest income total interest income decreased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in interest income on investments and other interest earning assets  while interest income on loans decreased million  or 
interest income on loans decreased primarily due to variations in the adjustments to accretable yield due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the fdic acquired loan pools as discussed below in interest income loans and in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
interest income from investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased during the year ended december  primarily due to lower average rates of interest 
the lower average investment yields were primarily a result of lower yields on mortgage backed securities as interest rates reset downward 
prepayments on the mortgages underlying these securities resulted in amortization of premiums which also reduced yields 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans decreased due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average balances 
interest income decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  this decrease was partially due to fluctuation in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions  as the additional yield accretion was less in than in on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools 
the cash flows estimate for the and fdic assisted transactions increased during the cash flows estimate for the fdic assisted transactions has increased each quarter since the third quarter of  based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools 
these adjustments resulted in a total of million of adjustments to date to be spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools 
the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
therefore  the expected indemnification assets for the fdic assisted transactions have also been reduced  resulting in a total of million of adjustments to date to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools  whichever is shorter 
the adjustments increased interest income by million and decreased non interest income by million during the year ended december   for a net impact of million to pre tax income 
because the adjustments will be recognized over the estimated remaining lives of the loan pools and the remainder of the loss sharing agreements  respectively  they will impact future periods as well 
the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets that will affect non interest income expense is million 
of the remaining adjustments  we expect to recognize million of interest income and million of non interest income expense in additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods as the company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools 
for further discussion about these adjustments  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
apart from the yield accretion  the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december   as a result of both normal amortization of higher rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates 
interest income increased million as a result of higher average loan balances which increased from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balances were primarily due to the loans acquired in the interbank fdic assisted transaction 
interest income investments and other interest earning assets interest income on investments decreased million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the majority of the company s securities in and were mortgage backed securities which are backed by hybrid arms that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally one to ten years and then adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
mortgage backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages 
as a result  premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly  thereby reducing the yield recorded 
interest income on investments increased  as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  average balances of securities increased due to purchases made for pledging to secure public fund deposits 
interest income on other interest earning assets increased  mainly due to higher average balances 
average balances of interest earning deposits increased due to repayment of loans and the cash received from the fdic in the interbank fdic assisted transaction 
the company s interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
total interest expense total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or  and a decrease in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of  or 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or 
interest expense deposits interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest since and because the company chose to pay lower rates during when compared to market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts have been decreasing since late when the frb began reducing short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the increase in average balances of demand deposits was primarily a result of demand deposits assumed in the sun security bank and interbank fdic assisted transactions in and also contributing to the increase was customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base  particularly in interest bearing checking accounts 
average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest expense on time deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  a large portion of the company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within one year and so it reprices fairly quickly  this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years 
interest expense on deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the increase in average balances of time deposits was primarily a result of time deposits assumed in the sun security bank and interbank fdic assisted transactions during and as previously mentioned  the increase in average balances of time deposits was partly offset by the customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits 
also offsetting the increase was the reduction of the balance of brokered deposits  primarily cdars accounts  of million from december  to december  the dodd frank act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july  although the ultimate impact of this legislation on the company has not yet been fully determined  the company expects interest costs associated with demand deposits may increase as a result of competitor responses to this change 
interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased due to lower average interest rates and lower average balances 
interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  most of the remaining advances are fixed rate and are subject to penalty if paid off prior to maturity 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the decrease in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with the company deposit customers which tend to fluctuate 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased  due to a slight increase in average rates on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements from the year ended december   to the year ended december  interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased  due to an increase in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  these debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at an average rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
the company s margin was positively impacted primarily by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in interest income loans and is discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
the impact of these changes on the years ended december  and were increases in interest income of million and million  respectively  and increases in net interest margin of basis points and basis points  respectively 
excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion  net interest margin decreased one basis point during the year ended december  during and  lower rate transaction deposits increased as customers added to existing accounts or new customer accounts were opened  while higher rate brokered deposits decreased and retail time deposits renewed at lower rates of interest 
while retail certificates of deposit increased over the year ago quarter because of the deposits assumed in the sun security bank and interbank fdic assisted acquisitions  those assumed were at relatively low market rates 
the former interbank generally paid above market rates on its certificates of deposit 
we have elected to reduce those rates as deposits have matured 
the company has also experienced decreases in yield on loans and investments  excluding the yield accretion income discussed above  when compared to the year ago quarter 
existing loans continue to repay  and in many cases new loans originated are at rates which are lower than the rates on those repaying loans and may be lower than existing portfolio rates 
the company overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to an basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings remained unchanged  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased basis points 
for additional information on net interest income components  refer to the average balances  interest rates and yields table in this report 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in the year ended december   versus million in the year ended december  eleven relationships made up million of the net charge off total for the year ended december  general market conditions  and more specifically  real estate  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs in both and as properties were categorized as potential problem loans  non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and internal as well as external reviews 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
loans acquired in the  and fdic assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the fdic and great southern bank which afford great southern bank at least protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans 
the fdic loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the fdic 
these limitations are described in detail in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
the acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values  which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates 
these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition 
techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio  with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics 
review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers  review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent 
at december  and  an allowance for loan losses was established for loan pools exhibiting risks of loss totaling  and  respectively 
because of the loss sharing agreements  only of the anticipated losses would be ultimately borne by the bank 
the bank allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  excluding loans supported by the fdic loss sharing agreements  was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company loan portfolio at december   based on recent reviews of the company loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate further  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets former teambank  vantus bank  sun security bank and interbank non performing assets  including foreclosed assets  are not included in the totals and in the discussion of non performing loans  potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which cover at least of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios 
in addition  fdic supported teambank  vantus bank  sun security bank and interbank assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates of march   september   october  and april   respectively 
the overall performance of the fdic covered loan pools has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates 
as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets  excluding fdic covered non performing assets  at december  were million  a decrease of million from million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million and foreclosed assets increased million to million 
commercial real estate loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  other commercial loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  one to four family residential loans comprised million  or of the total million of non performing loans at december non performing loans 
activity in the non performing loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from non performing transfers to potential problem loans transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the land development category of non performing loans included three loans 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by land located in the rogers  arkansas area 
the one to four family residential category included loans  of which were added during the year 
none of the loans added to the one to four family residential category during were included in borrower relationships that were larger than  the commercial real estate category included nine loans  seven of which were added during the year 
the largest two relationships in this category  which were added during the year  totaled million  or of the total category  and are collateralized by hotels 
the other commercial category included nine loans  five of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by stock 
foreclosed assets 
of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions in  and these acquired foreclosed assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and  therefore  are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets 
foreclosed assets have increased since the economic recession began in during the year  economic growth was slow and real estate markets did not experience a recovery 
because of this  we experienced continued higher levels of additions to foreclosed assets during because sales of foreclosed properties have been slower than additions  total foreclosed assets increased 
activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions proceeds from sales capitalized costs ore expense write downs ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate commercial business consumer total at december   the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which was located in the st

the land development category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which had a balance of million  or of the total category 
of the total dollar amount in the land development category  and was located in the branson  mo 
area and in northwest arkansas  respectively  including the largest property previously mentioned 
as discussed below in the non interest expense section  the million in write downs of foreclosed assets was primarily the result of management s evaluation of the foreclosed assets portfolio and decision to more aggressively market certain properties by reducing the asking prices 
management obtained broker pricing or used recent appraisals that were discounted based on internal experience selling or attempting to sell similar properties to determine the new asking prices 
the majority of these write downs were made in the subdivision construction and land development categories where properties are more speculative in nature and market activity has been very slow 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets  but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from potential problem transfers to non performing transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included loans

one relationship was collateralized by properties located in southwest missouri and the other relationship was collateralized by property located in st 
louis  mo 
the land development category included seven loans  five of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during the year  was million  or of the total catgegory and is collateralized by property in the branson  mo  area 
the other residential category included five loans  all of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by condominiums located in the st 
louis area 
the one to four family residential category included loans  of which were added during the year 
the largest relationship in this category  which was added during and included fifteen loans  totaled million  or of the total category  and was collateralized by over separate properties in southwest missouri 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily the result of the following items initial gains recognized on business acquisitions the initial gain recognized on business acquisitions increased million from the year ended december  during the quarter ended june   the bank recognized a one time gain on the fdic assisted acquisition of interbank of million pre tax 
in the prior year  the bank recognized a one time gain of million pre tax on the fdic assisted acquisition of sun security bank 
amortization of indemnification asset there was a smaller decrease to non interest income from amortization related to business acquisitions compared to the year ended december  the net amortization  an amount which reduces net interest income  decreased million from the prior year 
as previously described under net interest income  due to the increase in cash flows expected to be collected from the teambank  vantus bank  sun security bank and interbank fdic covered loan portfolios  million of amortization decrease in non interest income was recorded in the year ended december   relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
this amortization decrease in non interest income amount was down million from the million that was recorded in the year ended december   relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
offsetting this  the bank had additional income from the accretion of the discount on the indemnification assets related to the fdic assisted acquisitions involving sun security bank  which was completed in october  and interbank which was completed in april income from the accretion of the discount was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million recognized in the prior year 
securities gains and impairments realized gains on sales of available for sale securities  net of impairment losses  increased million from the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  losses totaling  and  respectively  were recorded as a result of impairment write downs in the value of an investment in a non agency cmo 
the impairment write downs recognized during reduced the book value of this security to zero 
gains on sales of single family loans gains on sales of single family loans increased million from the year ended december  this was due to an increase in originations primarily refinancings of fixed rate loans due to lower fixed rates  which were then sold in the secondary market 
tax credits the bank sold or utilized several state tax credits during the year ended december   which resulted in a gain of million 
interest rate derivative income the company recognized non interest income of million during the period related to its matched book interest rate derivatives program 
the company provides interest rate derivatives to certain qualifying customers in order to facilitate their respective interest rate management objectives 
those interest rate swaps are economically hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the company executes with a third party  such that the company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions 
however  the company does not account for these transactions as hedges 
the company earns non interest income related to the derivatives it provides to its customers  which represents compensation for credit risk and administrative costs associated with making a market in derivatives 
service charges and atm fees service charges and atm fees during the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   was  down from in due to the gain recognized on the fdic assisted acquisition  partially offset by increases in non interest expense described below 
the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the following were key items related to the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  sun security bank fdic assisted transaction non interest expense increased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   due to the operating costs related to the operations acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition involving the former sun security bank on october  of this amount   related to non recurring acquisition related costs incurred during the first quarter of  primarily salaries  and occupancy and equipment expenses 
interbank fdic assisted acquisition non interest expense increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   due to operating costs related to the operations acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition involving the former interbank on april  of this amount  million related to non recurring acquisition related expenses incurred during the second and third quarters of  primarily related to salaries and benefits  computer license and support  and legal and other professional fees 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million from the prior year primarily due to increases in expenses to originate loans  amortization of the core deposit intangible  contributions and other expenses 
partnership tax credit the company has invested in certain federal low income housing tax credits and federal new market tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over ten year and seven year periods  respectively 
during the year ended december   tax credits used to reduce the company s tax expense totaled million  up million from million for the year ended december  these tax credits resulted in corresponding amortization of million during the year ended december   up million from million for the year ended december  the net result of these transactions was an increase to non interest expense and a decrease to income tax expense  which positively impacted the company s effective tax rate  but negatively impacted the company s non interest expense and efficiency ratio 
new banking centers continued internal growth of the company since the year ended december   caused an increase in non interest expense during the year ended december  the company opened two retail banking centers in the st 
louis  mo  market area one in o fallon  mo  in february and one in affton  mo  in december the operation of these two new locations increased non interest expense for the year ended december   by  over the same period in foreclosure related expenses partially offsetting the above increases was a decrease in expenses on foreclosed assets of million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the prior year write downs of carrying values discussed previously 
the discount on foreclosed assets acquired through the  and fdic assisted acquisitions recognized as income decreased  these amounts were partially offset by an increase in expenses on foreclosed properties of  due to higher levels of foreclosed properties held 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates as compared to the statutory federal tax rate of were primarily affected by the tax credits noted above and by higher balances and rates of tax exempt investment securities and loans which reduce the company s effective tax rate 
the company s tax rate  however  was higher than in recent periods in the year ended december   due to the significant gain recognized on the fdic assisted transaction completed in  and the gains recognized on the sales of the travel and insurance business units in in future periods  the company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately of pre tax net income  assuming it continues to maintain or increase its use of investment tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans

non interest income for the year ended december  included a gain recognized on business acquisition of million  and also included net amortization expense of the fdic indemnification asset of million 
net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans  while interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased  or 
interest income on loans increased primarily due to increases in expected cash flows to be received from the fdic acquired loan pools and the resulting adjustments to accretable yield as discussed below in interest income loans and in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
interest income from investment securities and other interest earning assets was not significantly different in compared to interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans decreased due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average balances 
interest income decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  this decrease was partially due to fluctuation in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions  as the additional yield accretion was less in than in on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools 
the cash flows estimate for the and fdic assisted transactions increased during the cash flows estimate for the fdic assisted transactions has increased each quarter since the third quarter of  based on the payment histories and reduced loss expectations of the loan pools 
these adjustments resulted in a total of million of adjustments to date to be spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools 
the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
therefore  the expected indemnification assets for the fdic assisted transactions have also been reduced  resulting in a total of million of adjustments to date to be amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected life of the loan pools  whichever is shorter 
the adjustments increased interest income by million and decreased non interest income by million during the year ended december   for a net impact of million to pre tax income 
because the adjustments will be recognized over the estimated remaining lives of the loan pools and the remainder of the loss sharing agreements  respectively  they will impact future periods as well 
the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is million and the remaining adjustment to the indemnification assets that will affect non interest income expense is million 
of the remaining adjustments  we expect to recognize million of interest income and million of non interest income expense in additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods as the company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools 
for further discussion about these adjustments  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
apart from the yield accretion  the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december   as a result of both normal amortization of higher rate loans and new loans that were made at current lower market rates 
interest income decreased  as a result of lower average loan balances which decreased from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the lower average balances were primarily due to decreases in outstanding construction loans as many projects were completed in the past to months and demand for new construction loans has declined 
partially offsetting the decreases in construction loans were increased average balances of commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and other residential multi family loans 
interest income investments and other interest earning assets interest income on investments increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  average balances of securities increased due to purchases made for pledging to secure public fund deposits 
interest income on investments decreased million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the majority of the company s securities in and were mortgage backed securities which are backed by hybrid arms that have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally one to ten years and then adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities are subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
mortgage backed securities are also subject to reduced yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages 
as a result  premiums on these securities may be amortized against interest income more quickly  thereby reducing the yield recorded 
interest income on other interest earning assets changed little as slightly higher average rates were offset by lower average balances 
average balances of interest earning deposits decreased due to increased loan funding  purchases of available for sale securities and redemption of brokered deposits  partially offset by the cash received from the fdic in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
the company s interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents currently earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
total interest expense total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or 
interest expense deposits interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest since and because the company chose to pay lower rates during when compared to market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts have been decreasing since late when the frb began reducing short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the increase in average balances of demand deposits was primarily a result of customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base  particularly in interest bearing checking accounts 
demand deposits assumed in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increase in average balances 
average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  interest expense on time deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  a large portion of the company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within one year and so it reprices fairly quickly  this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years 
interest expense on deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  as previously mentioned  the decrease in average balances of time deposits was partly the result of customer preference to transition from time deposits to demand deposits 
also contributing to the decrease was the redemption of million of brokered deposits since while just million of new brokered deposits were added due to the company s existing liquidity levels 
time deposits assumed in the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction during the fourth quarter of somewhat offset the decrease in average balances 
interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased due to lower average interest rates and lower average balances 
interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  most of the remaining advances are fixed rate and are subject to penalty if paid off prior to maturity 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased  due to an increase in average rates on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the decrease in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to decreases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with the company deposit customers which tend to fluctuate 
interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to a decrease in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  these debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at an average rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to in  an increase of basis points 
the company s margin was positively impacted primarily by the increases in expected cash flows to be received from the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions and the resulting increases to accretable yield which was discussed previously in interest income loans and is discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the impact of these changes on the years ended december  and were increases in interest income of million and million  respectively  and increases in net interest margin of basis points and basis points  respectively 
excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion  net interest margin increased basis points during the year ended december   primarily due to a change in the deposit mix during during  lower cost checking accounts increased as customers added to existing accounts or new customer accounts were opened while higher cost brokered deposits decreased 
during  the company redeemed million of brokered deposits due to the company s existing liquidity levels 
for most of  retail certificates of deposit continued to decrease  and those that were renewed or replaced generally had lower market rates of interest 
in the fourth quarter of  retail certificates of deposit increased due to the sun security bank fdic assisted transaction 
however  those assumed deposits generally paid lower rates of interest than existing retail certificates of deposit 
partially offsetting the decrease in rates on deposits was a decrease in yields on loans  excluding the yield accretion income discussed above  when compared to the company overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to an basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the company overall net interest margin increased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans increased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets increased four basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings increased one basis point  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased three basis points

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in the year ended december   versus million in the year ended december  ten relationships made up million of the net charge off total for the year ended december  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs in both and as properties were categorized as potential problem loans  non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
loans acquired in the march   september  and october   fdic assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the fdic and great southern bank which afford great southern bank at least protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans 
the fdic loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the fdic 
these limitations are described in detail in note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
the acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values  which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates 
these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition 
techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio  with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics 
review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers  review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent 
at december  and  an allowance for loan losses was established for one loan pool exhibiting risks of loss totaling  the loan pool was acquired through the vantus bank fdic assisted transaction and because of the loss sharing agreement  only of the anticipated  loss would be ultimately borne by the bank 
at december   an allowance for loan losses was established for one other loan pool exhibiting risks of loss estimated at  this loan pool was charged off during at an amount of  which was the remaining balance of the loan pool  of which  was covered by the loss sharing agreement 
the bank allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  excluding loans supported by the fdic loss sharing agreements  was and at december  and  respectively 
management considered the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company loan portfolio at december   based on recent reviews of the company loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
non performing assets former teambank  vantus bank and sun security bank non performing assets  including foreclosed assets  are not included in the totals and in the discussion of non performing loans  potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which cover at least of principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios 
in addition  these covered assets were recorded at their estimated fair values as of march   for teambank  september   for vantus bank and october   for sun security bank 
the overall performance of the teambank and vantus bank fdic covered loan pools has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates 
because of the recent acquisition date for the sun security bank fdic covered loan pools  initial performance expectations had not materially changed as of december  as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets  excluding fdic covered assets  at december  were million  a decrease of million from million at december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december  compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million and foreclosed assets decreased million to million 
construction and land development loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  non performing loans

foreclosed assets 
of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions in and these acquired foreclosed assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and  therefore  are not included in the following table and discussion of foreclosed assets 
activity in foreclosed assets during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions proceeds from sales capitalized costs ore expense write downs ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate commercial business consumer total at december   the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which was located in the st

of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category  is located in branson  mo 
the land development category of foreclosed assets included properties  the largest of which had a balance of million  or of the total category 
of the total dollar amount in the land development category  was located in northwest arkansas  including the largest property previously mentioned 
as discussed below in the non interest expense section  the million in write downs of foreclosed assets was primarily the result of management s evaluation of the foreclosed assets portfolio and decision to more aggressively market certain properties by reducing the asking prices 
management obtained broker pricing or used recent appraisals that were discounted based on internal experience selling or attempting to sell similar properties to determine the new asking prices 
the majority of these write downs were made in the subdivision construction and land development categories where properties are more speculative in nature and market activity has been very slow 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets  but are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended december   was as follows beginning balance  january additions removed from potential problem transfers to non performing transfers to foreclosed assets charge offs payments ending balance  december in thousands one to four family construction subdivision construction land development commercial construction one to four family residential other residential commercial real estate other commercial consumer total at december   the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans included loans

the other residential category included four loans  three of which were added during the year 
the largest two relationships in this category  which were added during the year  had balances of million and million  respectively  or of the total category 
the relationships were collateralized by apartment buildings in southwest missouri and central missouri  respectively 
non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  due to the sale of the travel and insurance business units in  certain non interest income items have been included in discontinued operations 
the decrease of million  or  was primarily the result of the following items amortization of indemnification asset as previously described under net interest income  due to the increase in cash flows expected to be collected from the teambank and vantus bank fdic covered loan portfolios  million of amortization expense was recorded in the year ended december  relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which are recorded as indemnification assets 
this amortization expense amount was up million from the million that was recorded in the year ended december  relating to reductions of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
gains on securities fewer securities were sold during the year ended december   and  therefore  gains recognized on sales were  down million from million recognized for the year ended december  securities impairments during the year ended december   losses totaling  were recorded as a result of impairment write downs in the value of an investment in a non agency cmo 
the company continues to hold this security in the available for sale category 
based on analyses of the securities portfolio during  no impairment write downs were necessary 
partially offsetting the above decreases in non interest income was the preliminary one time gain of million pre tax recorded in relation to the sun security bank fdic assisted acquisition during the year ended december   compared to the same period in non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  due to the sale of the travel and insurance business units in  certain non interest expense items have been included in discontinued operations 
the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   was  up from in due to increased non interest expenses as described below 
the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the following were key items related to the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  sun security bank fdic assisted transaction non interest expense increased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   due to the fdic assisted acquisition of the former sun security bank on october  of this amount  million related to non recurring acquisition related expenses  primarily related to salaries and benefits  and occupancy and equipment expenses 
salaries and benefits as a result of integrating the operations of sun security bank and the company s overall growth  the number of associates employed by the company in operational and lending areas increased from december  to december  this personnel increase  which excludes associates added from the former sun security bank  as well as general merit increases for existing associates  was responsible for million of the increase in salaries and benefits paid during the year ended december  when compared with the year ended december  amortization of tax credits the company has invested in certain federal low income housing tax credits and federal new market tax credits 
these credits are typically purchased at of the amount of the credit and are generally utilized to offset taxes payable over ten year and seven year periods  respectively 
during the year ended december   tax credits used to reduce the company s tax expense totaled million  up million from million for the year ended december  these tax credits resulted in corresponding amortization of million during the year ended december   up million from million for the year ended december  the net result of these transactions was an increase to non interest expense and a decrease to income tax expense  which positively impacted the company s effective tax rate  but negatively impacted the company s non interest expense and efficiency ratio 
foreclosure related expenses since the economic recession began in  real estate markets have not experienced full recovery and the company has had continued higher levels of foreclosed assets 
sales of certain types of foreclosed properties have been slow and as a result  the most recent asking prices for certain properties  which were based on estimated fair values  no longer reflected reasonable selling prices 
during the year ended december   the asking prices and recorded values for most properties in foreclosed assets  excluding those covered by fdic loss sharing agreements  were reviewed and  in some cases  management and the board of directors decided to take a more aggressive approach to market some of these properties 
in the instances where the asking prices were reduced  the carrying values of the assets were adjusted down to reflect the new estimated selling prices 
in reviewing the values of the properties  the company either used broker pricing or obtained new appraisals and discounted them based on our internal experience with similar properties 
the result of this review was a million write down in the carrying value of foreclosed assets during the year ended december   primarily resulting in a million increase in foreclosure related expenses over the year ended december  prior to the write downs  the book values of the properties totaled million 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates as compared to the statutory federal tax rate of were primarily affected by the tax credits noted above and by higher balances and rates of tax exempt investment securities and loans which reduce the company s effective tax rate 
for future periods  the company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately of pre tax net income due to expected continued utilization of tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate as it is impacted by the level and timing of its utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
these obligations include the credit needs of customers  funding deposit withdrawals and the day to day operations of the company 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans 
as a result of the company management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs

the company experienced positive cash flows from investing activities during and and negative cash flows from investing activities during the company experienced negative cash flows from financing activities during  and cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the statements of cash flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets  credits and other liabilities  the provision for loan losses  impairments of investment securities  depreciation  gains on the purchase of additional business units and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts premiums on loans and investments  all of which are non cash or non operating adjustments to operating cash flows 
net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items and the origination and sale of loans held for sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities 
operating activities provided cash flows of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively

financing activities used cash flows of million during the year ended december   primarily due to the repayment of advances from the fhlbank and reduction of time deposit balances 
financing activities used cash flows of million during the year ended december   primarily due to reductions in customer repurchase agreements  reductions of brokered deposit balances and reductions of cdars purchased funds and cdars customer accounts 
in  the change in cash flows from financing activities was also impacted by the issuance of preferred stock through the company s participation in the sblf program as well as the redemption of preferred stock and the repurchase of common stock warrants which were both issued in conjunction with the company s participation in the cpp 
financing activities used cash flows of million for the year ended december   primarily due to reductions of brokered deposit balances and reductions in customer repurchase agreements primarily offset by increases in transaction deposits 
financing activities in the future are expected to primarily include changes in deposits  changes in fhlbank advances  changes in short term borrowings and dividend payments to stockholders

these ratios compare capital  as defined by the risk based regulations  to assets adjusted for their relative risk as defined by the regulations 
guidelines require banks to have a minimum tier risk based capital ratio  as defined  of  a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  and a minimum tier leverage ratio 
on december   the bank tier risk based capital ratio was  total risk based capital ratio was and the tier leverage ratio was

on december   the company completed a transaction to participate in the treasury s voluntary capital purchase program cpp 
the cpp  a part of the emergency economic stabilization act of  was designed to provide capital to healthy financial institutions  thereby increasing confidence in the banking industry and increasing the flow of financing to businesses and consumers 
at the time the company was approved to participate in the cpp in december  it exceeded all well capitalized regulatory benchmarks and  as indicated above  it continues to exceed these benchmarks 
the company received million from the treasury through the sale of  shares of the company newly authorized fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the cpp preferred stock 
the company also issued to the us treasury a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the amount of preferred shares sold represented approximately of the company risk weighted assets at september  on august   the company entered into a small business lending fund securities purchase agreement purchase agreement with the secretary of the treasury  pursuant to which the company sold  shares of the company s senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a the sblf preferred stock to the secretary of the treasury for a purchase price of  the sblf preferred stock was issued pursuant to treasury s sblf program  a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing tier capital to qualified community banks and holding companies with assets of less than billion 
as required by the purchase agreement  the proceeds from the sale of the sblf preferred stock were used to redeem the  shares of preferred stock  previously issued to the treasury pursuant to the cpp  at a redemption price of million plus the accrued dividends owed on the preferred shares 
the sblf preferred stock qualifies as tier capital 
the holder of the sblf preferred stock is entitled to receive non cumulative dividends  payable quarterly  on each january  april  july and october the dividend rate  as a percentage of the liquidation amount  can fluctuate between one percent and five percent per annum on a quarterly basis during the first quarters during which the sblf preferred stock is outstanding  based upon changes in the level of qualified small business lending or qsbl as defined in the purchase agreement by the bank over the adjusted baseline level calculated under the terms of the sblf preferred stock 
the initial dividend rate through september   was and the dividend rate for the fourth quarter of was 
based upon the increase in the bank s level of qsbl over the adjusted baseline level  the dividend rate for was approximately 
for the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance  the dividend rate will be fixed at between one percent and seven percent based upon the level of qualifying loans 
after four and one half years from issuance  the dividend rate will increase to including a quarterly lending incentive fee of 
the sblf preferred stock is non voting  except in limited circumstances 
in the event that the company misses five dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  the holder of the sblf preferred stock will have the right  but not the obligation  to appoint a representative as an observer on the company s board of directors 
in the event that the company misses six dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  and if the then outstanding aggregate liquidation amount of the sblf preferred stock is at least  then the holder of the sblf preferred stock will have the right to designate two directors to the board of directors of the company 
the sblf preferred stock may be redeemed at any time at the company s option  at a redemption price of of the liquidation amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption for the current period  subject to the approval of its federal banking regulator 
on september   the company completed the repurchase of the warrant held by the treasury that was issued as a part of its participation in the cpp 
the year warrant was issued on december  and entitled the treasury to purchase  shares of great southern bancorp  inc common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the repurchase was completed for a price of million  or per warrant share  which was based on the fair market value of the warrant as agreed upon by the company and the treasury 
dividends 
during the year ended december   the company declared and paid common stock cash dividends of per share of net income per common share 
during the year ended december   the company declared and paid common stock cash dividends of per share of net income per common share 
the board of directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments 
in addition  the company paid preferred dividends as described below 
as a result of the issuance of preferred stock to the treasury pursuant to the cpp in december  during the year ended december   the company paid preferred stock cash dividends of  on each of february   may  and august  in addition  previously accrued but unpaid preferred stock cash dividends of  were paid on august  in conjunction with the redemption of the cpp preferred stock on the same date 
during the year ended december   the company paid preferred stock cash dividends of  on each of february   may   august   and november  the redemption of the cpp preferred stock resulted in a non cash deemed preferred stock dividend that reduced net income available to common shareholders in the year ended december  by million 
this amount represents the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying amount of the cpp preferred stock  or the accelerated accretion of the applicable discount on the cpp preferred stock 
the terms of the sblf preferred stock impose limits on the ability of the company to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock 
under the terms of the sblf preferred stock  no repurchases may be effected  and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the sblf preferred stock  junior preferred shares  or other junior securities including the common stock during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the sblf preferred stock  except that  in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid  dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach 
under the terms of the sblf preferred stock  the company may only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock or other stock junior to the sblf preferred stock  or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock  if  after payment of such dividend  or after giving effect to such repurchase  i the dollar amount of the company s tier capital would be at least equal to the tier dividend threshold and ii full dividends on all outstanding shares of sblf preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid 
as of december   we satisfied this condition 
the tier dividend threshold means of  which was the company s consolidated tier capital as of june   less the million in tarp preferred stock then outstanding and repaid on august   plus the  in sblf preferred stock issued and minus the net loan charge offs by the bank since august  the tier dividend threshold is subject to reduction  beginning on the first day of the eleventh dividend period following the date of issuance of the sblf preferred stock  by  ten percent of the aggregate liquidation amount of the sblf preferred stock initially issued  without regard to any subsequent partial redemptions for each one percent increase in qualified small business lending from the adjusted baseline level under the terms of the sblf preferred stock ie   to the ninth dividend period 
common stock repurchases and issuances 
the company has been in various buy back programs since may our ability to repurchase common stock is currently restricted under the terms of the sblf preferred stock as noted above  under dividends and was previously generally precluded due to our participation in the cpp beginning in december therefore  during the years ended december  and  the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 
during the years ended december  and  the company issued  shares of stock at an average price of per share and  shares of stock at an average price of per share  respectively  to cover stock option exercises 
management has historically utilized stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock contributed to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is neutral to slightly negative 
generally  a rate increase by the frb would be expected to have an immediate negative impact on great southern s net interest income 
as the federal funds rate is now very low  the company s interest rate floors have been reached on most of its prime rate loans 
in addition  great southern has elected to leave its great southern prime rate at for those loans that are indexed to great southern prime rather than wall street journal prime 
while these interest rate floors and prime rate adjustments have helped keep the rate on our loan portfolio higher in this very low interest rate environment  they will also reduce the positive effect to our loan rates when market interest rates  specifically the prime rate  begin to increase 
the interest rate on these loans will not increase until the loan floors are reached and the wall street journal prime interest rate exceeds 
if rates remain generally unchanged in the short term  we expect that our cost of funds will continue to decrease somewhat as we continue to redeem some of our wholesale funds 
in addition  a significant portion of our retail certificates of deposit mature in and we expect that they will be replaced  in whole or in part  with new certificates of deposit at somewhat lower interest rates 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
in the normal course of business  the company may use derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps from time to time to assist in its interest rate risk management 
prior to december   the company used interest rate swap derivatives  primarily as an asset liability management strategy  in order to hedge against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provided for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company paid or received interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began executing interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies 
those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the company executes with a third party  such that the company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions 
because the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements  changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings 
these interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and  therefore  are not used to manage interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities 
the company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions 
the company s interest rate swaps are discussed further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this report

these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment
