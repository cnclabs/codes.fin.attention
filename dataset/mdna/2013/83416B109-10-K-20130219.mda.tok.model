our customers include small and mid size businesses  large enterprises  and local  state and federal government entities that have purchased our products 
acquisitions we have made a number of strategic product acquisitions and product releases in and that we believe are important to our long term growth 
we entered into several new markets including the system and application management market  virtualization management market and the log and security information management market 
these new markets include software for managing network devices  firewalls  applications  physical and virtual servers  storage devices  log and security management and mobile and remote access to it infrastructures 
we will continue to look for acquisitions similar to those we have completed in the past and will be more aggressive in looking at new markets in the future to supplement our internal product development efforts 
during  we acquired athena security  inc  or athena and rhino software  inc  or rhinosoft and certain assets of eminentware  inc  or eminentware  rove mobile  inc  or rove and macsdesign  llc  or macsdesign for a combined purchase price of million 
we account for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the financial results for these entities are included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates

table of contents in  we have transitioned from a network management software company into an it infratructure management software company with a portfolio of products for it professionals in organizations of all sizes 
we made a number of strategic investments in our business in that we believe are an important foundation for our long term growth such as we acquired new technology that significantly expands the number of it management problems that we solve for it professionals  we introduced certain localized products with country specific product documentation  websites and marketing material for the japanese and german markets as part of the ongoing effort to more effectively reach  market and support users around the world 
in addition  our sales and support organizations added language capabilities to their teams to ensure we are maintaining the same high quality customer experience for our international customers  we continued to expand our international research and development locations allowing us to respond to user demand and support new product releases and enhancements for our acquired and internally developed technologies  we released enhancements to solarwinds 
com and thwack 
com to reach potential buyers and integrate our user community 
we also invested in marketing programs to build brand awareness and enhance our search optimization  and we added targeted sales teams for products and regions that utilize our low touch  high volume sales model 
despite these specific investments and a number of other important investments  we continued to grow our operating income and increase our cash flows from operating activities 
we are committed to our business model and have continued to focus on ways to leverage and refine our model 
we are pursuing a number of strategies that we believe will enable us to continue to grow 
we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods but there are still many areas where we believe that we can continue to grow and improve 
we expect to grow our business by focusing on the following initiatives acquisitions of products that will expand our network management and systems and application management offerings or potentially acquisitions of products in new markets  increasing our presence in several key geographic markets including asia pacific  latin america  europe  middle east and africa by expanding our product portfolio  websites and marketing material  which includes additional localization of our products  websites  and documentation  and establishing new relationships with distributors and resellers  expanding our web presence  brand awareness and improving our communication with prospects and our current customers domestically and internationally  and international expansion company wide at lower cost locations to drive our competitive advantage 
we expect to continue to generate solid growth while delivering strong operating income and increase our cash flows from operating activities in with our disciplined approach to investing in our business combined with the large market opportunity 

table of contents key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor the performance of our business model and to identify trends affecting our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance are as follows revenue growth revenue growth includes the total revenue growth in our license and maintenance revenue  which are both critical to our long term success 
we have employed a differentiated business model for marketing and selling high volumes of enterprise class software  which is focused on revenue growth at high operating margins 
we regularly review our total revenue growth to measure the success of our investments and strategic business decisions 
we have built a financial and operational model that focuses on the long term value of our customer relationships 
after the initial new license purchase  our goal is to create opportunities for sales of additional products  license upgrades and renewal purchases from the customer 
this is an important component of our financial model and future revenue growth 
this model is based on the premise that we will be able to deliver ongoing value to our customers and maintain a long term financial relationship with the users of our it management products 
our annual revenue growth percentages were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
core product transaction growth for new license sales 
we focus our sales  marketing and research and development efforts on it professionals in organizations of all sizes  with the goal of driving purchases of our software by these it professionals in short sales cycles 
in addition  many of our customers make small initial purchases of our software and then over time may purchase an upgrade to increase the size of their license or buy additional software products from us 
we review the core product transaction growth to ensure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales model and expect core product transaction volume growth to be the primary driver of our new license growth 
we define our core product transactions as the number of new license sales transactions that include at least one of our core products 
we define a transaction as each invoice issued for the sale of one or more of our products 
if one of our core products is included in a particular transaction  then that transaction is a core product transaction 
new license sales of core products represented more than of our license revenue for accordingly  we believe that management can better evaluate changes in our product portfolio  expansion into new markets and the addition of new customers by evaluating the transactional growth of our core products 
our core product transaction growth for new license sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non gaap operating income our management uses non gaap operating income as one key measure of our performance 
because non gaap operating income excludes certain items such as amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes and certain acquisition related adjustments that may not be indicative of our core business  we believe that this measure provides us with additional useful information to measure and understand our performance  particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period 
we use non gaap operating income in the preparation of our budgets and to measure and monitor our performance 
non gaap operating income is not determined in accordance with gaap and is not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that reflects the cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment that can then be used for  among other things  strategic acquisitions 
table of contents and investments in the business  stock repurchases and funding ongoing operations 
we regularly review our free cash flow generation to measure our effectiveness at running our operations efficiently and in a manner that maximizes the value of our business 
we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities plus the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and less the purchase of property and equipment 
free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period  is not determined in accordance with gaap and is not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
for further discussion regarding non gaap financial measures including non gaap operating income and free cash flow  see non gaap financial measures below 
opportunities  trends and uncertainties businesses  governments and other organizations are increasingly relying on networks  systems  and applications to execute their operations  facilitate their internal and external communications and transact business with their customers and partners 
the size of these networks  the number of applications and servers  and the complexity of physical and virtual server environments are increasing as organizations place more reliance on them 
in addition  the adoption of cloud computing technologies  which is shifting a growing number of critical workloads off premises  along with business initiatives to capture  store  and analyze an increasing amount of organizational data are creating new it management challenges 
in order to address these challenges  we offer a cohesive portfolio of powerful  yet easy to use and affordably priced it management products spanning networks  systems  and application management 
this includes software that we have either developed or acquired that allows it professionals to manage the performance  health  and configurations of network devices  firewalls  applications  physical and virtual servers  storage devices  as well as software for log and security information management 
it also includes software that provides it professionals with mobile and remote access to their it infrastructure and software to help them track and resolve it issues along with their it assets 
we believe that it related trends and the limitations of existing offerings present a significant market opportunity for our products 
we expect our revenue to continue to grow as we capitalize on these and other market opportunities and target license revenue growth of over the next three to five years 
any revenue growth and operating synergies of our acquired products and businesses depends on our ability to successfully integrate those products and businesses and may be lower than expected if we are unable to do so in the future 
in  we recognized of our revenue from sales by our international subsidiaries 
we believe there is a substantial opportunity for additional sales of our software in the europe  middle east and africa  or emea  region  the asian pacific region  and the latin american region and we intend to increase our sales  marketing and support operations in these regions 
however  we believe there is significant uncertainty regarding the economic conditions in certain of these geographic regions  particularly in parts of europe 
while we believe that any difficult economic conditions may adversely affect the sales of our products  this could also offer us an opportunity to market and sell our products to mid size businesses and enterprise customers at compelling prices compared to the prices of some competing products 
we expect the us federal government to continue to be a significant market opportunity  as we believe the ease of deployment  power and scalability of our products gives us a competitive advantage to sell to various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
the us federal government new license sales were of our total new license sales in we have experienced and continue to expect inconsistency in the buying pattern of the us federal government for larger transactions with our products 
our sales  both new licenses and maintenance renewals  to the us federal government are largely dependent on systems integrators  distributors and resellers whose purchases from us have been difficult to predict 
in addition  we believe that many of our larger transactions with the us federal government are dependent on specific projects that may or may not be continued at the same scale in the future due to budgetary cuts or other reasons  and the reduction or cancellation of specific projects such as these may change the buying patterns of the us federal government and could result in our sales to the us government being less than expected 

table of contents key components of our results of operations sources of revenue our revenue is primarily comprised of license and maintenance revenue 
we license our software under perpetual licenses  which ordinarily include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of the product 
license revenue reflects the revenue recognized from sales of new licenses and upgrades of license size to our software 
we have experienced annual growth in license revenue 
customers can renew  and generally have renewed  their maintenance agreements at our standard list maintenance renewal pricing for their software products 
current customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements when and if they become available 
maintenance revenue is an important source of our future revenue 
we have experienced strong and consistent annual and quarterly growth in maintenance and other revenue 
because our maintenance base grew during  and due to new license sales  high customer retention and acquisitions  we expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs related to providing technical support services and amortization of acquired developed product technologies and third party software licenses 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes for technical support personnel  as well as an allocation of our facilities  information technology  employee benefit and other overhead costs 
we allocate stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes to personnel costs based on the expense category in which the option or restricted stock unit holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent  computer and other technology costs  and employee benefit costs to personnel costs in each expense category based on worldwide headcount in that category 
the amortization of developed product technologies can vary significantly each period based on the size and timing of our acquisitions 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as we acquire additional companies and as we increase our headcount to support new customers and product offerings 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into four categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative and accrued earnout gain 
our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract research and development costs  marketing program costs and legal  accounting  consulting and other professional service fees 
personnel costs for each category of operating expenses primarily include employee compensation costs and facility overhead costs 
our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of revenue in compared to and  as we have continued to build infrastructure and add employees through acquisitions and organic growth across all departments in order to accelerate and support our growth 
the number of full time employees as of december   was  as compared to  as of december  and as of december  we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we make long term investments in our business both domestically and internationally 
as we acquire additional companies and integrate the businesses  we will continue to target our corporate margin structure although our operating expenses in future periods may increase in absolute dollars and fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as a result of such acquisitions 
in addition  we intend to continue to grant equity awards to our current executives and employees and those who join us in the future through acquisitions or otherwise  which will result in additional stock based compensation expense 

table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees and executives  commissions earned by our sales personnel  the cost of marketing programs such as paid search  search engine optimization and management  website maintenance and design and the cost of business development programs 
we expect to continue to hire sales personnel in the united states and in our international sales offices at a rate consistent with our expected new license sales growth 
in  as part of our international expansion initiatives  we are opening a sales office in brazil to help us leverage the sales opportunity in latin america 
we also expect to continue to invest in our websites  online user community site and marketing programs to drive customer downloads and support our new product launches 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our product development employees and executives and  to a lesser extent  contractor fees 
we have devoted our development efforts primarily to expanding our product line and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our software products 
we have significantly increased our research and development employee headcount with the continued expansion of our research and development centers in the czech republic and india  which has resulted in and will continue to result in an increase in facilities and personnel costs 
we expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities by hiring engineers in our international locations  which will allow us to continue our research and development growth strategy internationally 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
legal  accounting and other professional service fees along with general corporate expenses are also recorded in general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur higher administrative costs in future periods as our business continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions 
accrued earnout gain 
accrued earnout gain represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability recorded on the acquisition due to subsequent adjustments in the probability assumptions 
we review the probability of achieving the earnout objectives each quarter to determine if the probability assumptions need to be adjusted and the contingent consideration revalued 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income  grant income  transactional foreign exchange gains losses  foreign exchange contracts gains losses and acquisition related contingent consideration fair value adjustments due to the passage of time 
we periodically receive government grant income related to grants in our czech republic and ireland entities for the creation of job positions and related training costs 
the amount and timing of the grant payments is determined by the czech and irish governments 
interest income represents interest received on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  including any amortization or accretion of the premium and discount 
foreign exchange gains losses primarily relate to expenses and billing transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the associated subsidiary 
foreign exchange contracts gains losses relate to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures that are not formally designated as hedges 
interest expense in was associated with our outstanding long term debt which was paid in full in may income tax expense income tax expense primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our software offerings by our only two entities that sell our software  one in the united states and one in ireland 
the rate of taxation on income earned by our us entity is higher than the rate of taxation on income earned by our irish entity 
if our international income  as a percentage of total income  increases as we expect  then our effective income tax rate should correspondingly decline 
however  our effective tax rate may be affected by many other factors  such as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  new interpretations of existing laws or 
table of contents regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  the impact of accounting for uncertain tax positions  changes in our international structure  shifts in the amount of taxable income earned in the united states  as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
our results of operations reflect an income tax benefit from the tax credit incentives under the us research and experimentation tax credit  or r e tax credit  for the years ended december  and our results of operations for the year ended december  do not reflect an income tax benefit related to the r e tax credits as the r e tax credit expired on december  however  the r e tax credit was extended by the signing of the american taxpayer relief act of  or the act  on january  the act retroactively extended the r e tax credit from january  through december  since the act was enacted during  the income tax benefit related to the r e tax credit will be reflected in our results of operations for the quarter ended march   which we expect will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate 
the tax credit is currently set to expire on december   and may not be renewed  or if renewed  it may be renewed on terms significantly less favorable than current tax incentives or on terms resulting in our disqualification from the benefits of the r e tax credit 
the elimination or significant reduction in the r e tax credit would increase our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states of america generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected  perhaps materially 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that these accounting policies requiring significant management judgment and estimates are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas of our financial results 
these critical accounting policies are valuation of goodwill  intangibles  long lived assets and contingent consideration  including accrued earnouts  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes  and loss contingencies 
acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
we must also estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration 
the operating results of acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition 

table of contents the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on significant judgments made by management 
we typically engage third party valuation appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of the assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from management  and also include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows earned from the intangible asset and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the acquired developed product technologies recorded for each acquisition were feasible at the date of acquisition as they were being actively marketed and sold by the acquired company at the acquisition date 
in addition to the acquired developed product technologies  we also record intangible assets for the acquired company s customer relationships  trademarks  in process research and development and non competition covenants 
an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment is highly subjective and requires the application of significant judgment 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  we assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite lived assets might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test which considers our market capitalization compared with the carrying amount of our net assets on the date of the test  since we have only one reporting unit 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
as of december  and  we performed our annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for our reporting unit during any of the periods presented 
no impairment charges have been required to date 
we evaluate long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and other assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment or our finite lived intangibles and other assets  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
as of december  and  there were no indicators that our long lived assets were impaired 
contingent consideration 
our acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future sales or product milestones of an acquired entity 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities based on certain milestones of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement and discount the liabilities to present value using our pre tax cost of debt 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities may result from changes in discount periods  changes in the timing and amount of sales and or other specific milestone estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria 
at each reporting date  the contingent consideration liability is revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisitions are reflected in net income in the consolidated statements of income and could cause a material impact to  and volatility in  our operating results 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from the licensing of our software products and from the sale of maintenance agreements 
we typically include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of each software offering and then sell renewals of this maintenance agreement 
in accordance with current guidance  we recognize revenue for software  maintenance and other services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
our return policy generally does not allow our customers to return software products 
license revenue 
we consider delivery of our software to have occurred and recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses to our software when risk of loss transfers to the customer  reseller or distributor  which is generally upon electronic transfer of the license key which provides immediate availability of the product to the purchaser 
we sell licenses to our software products through our direct sales force and through our distributors and other resellers 
our distributors and resellers do not carry inventory of our software and we generally require them to specify the end user of the software at the time of the order 
if the distributor or reseller does not provide end user information  then we will generally not fulfill the order 
our distributors and resellers have no rights of return or exchange for software that they purchase from us and payment for these purchases is due to us without regard to whether the distributors or resellers collect payment from their customers 
because our software is generally sold with maintenance  we calculate the amount of revenue allocated to the software license by determining the fair value of the maintenance and subtracting it from the total invoice or contract amount 
we establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of maintenance services by the standard published list pricing for our maintenance renewals since we generally charge list prices for our maintenance renewals 
if in the future we were unable to establish vsoe of fair value of the maintenance or other services we would defer all revenue over the term of the agreement and until all elements of the agreement had been delivered which could significantly impact the timing of our revenue recognition 
maintenance and other revenue 
we derive maintenance revenue from fees for software maintenance services which includes the maintenance portion allocated from the initial license transaction and any subsequent maintenance renewal transactions 
we generally bill maintenance renewal agreements annually in advance for services to be performed over a month period 
customers have the option to purchase maintenance renewals for periods other than months 
we initially record the amounts to be paid under maintenance agreements as deferred revenue and recognize these amounts ratably on a daily basis over the term of the contract period 
customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements to new versions of their software products on a when and if available basis 
other revenue consists primarily of subscription revenue which is recognized ratably on a daily basis over the term of the contract period 
other revenue is not currently significant 
stock based compensation we have granted and expect to continue to grant our employees and directors stock based incentive awards 
these awards are in the form of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the date of grant 
the fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is determined using the fair market value of our common stock based on the quoted market price on the date of grant  or intrinsic value 
we use various assumptions in estimating the fair value of options at the date of grant using the black scholes option model including expected dividend yield  volatility  risk free rate of return and expected life 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  we assume the 
table of contents expected dividend yield to be zero 
since we were a private entity prior to our ipo in may and have limited historical data regarding the volatility of our own common stock price  we based the expected volatility on the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative industry peer group 
we determined expected volatility of options granted using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies 
we based the risk free rate of return on the average us treasury yield curve for five and seven year terms 
as allowed under current guidance  we have elected to apply the simplified method in developing our estimate of expected life for plain vanilla stock options by using the midpoint between the vesting date and contractual termination date since we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded 
for all dates  we granted employees options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is the closing price of our common stock as reported by the nyse 
we plan to grant restricted stock units as the primary form of equity awards to our employees in we will continue to grant restricted stock units and stock options to our executives and board of directors in income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
at december  and  we had million and million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively  all of which  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of december  and  there was an insignificant amount accrued for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
in calculating our effective tax rate  we make judgments regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the guidance requires us to identify  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained  or may only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for  and the adequacy of  valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we intend either to invest our non us earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our us entities in a tax free manner 
for this reason  we do not record federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries

we have maintained high customer retention and in addition  our renewal base has continued to increase each quarter as we have begun to renew and recognize the maintenance revenue associated with our acquired products 
license revenue increased million due to continued growth in new license sales of our newly acquired system management products and our network management products 
we define newly acquired products as those acquired within the last year

as the number of core product transactions fluctuates with changes in the business or product mixes  this also affects our trailing month average transaction size for new license sales 
as of december   the trailing month average transaction size for new license sales  excluding our high volume and low priced kiwi and dameware products  was approximately  as compared to approximately  for the trailing month period as of december   a decrease of

general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in amortization expense related to certain acquired intangible assets  a million increase in personnel costs  which include stock based compensation expense and a million increase in other miscellaneous costs including professional fees 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in acquisition related costs for the year

our 
table of contents effective tax rate increased from in to in  which was primarily attributable to the expiration of the r e tax credit and a reduction to the permanent income tax benefit related to the us domestic production activities deduction  which was partially offset by an increase in international earnings  which are generally taxed at lower tax rates 
although our results of operations for the year ended december  do not reflect an income tax benefit related to the r e tax credits as the r e tax credit expired on december   the r e tax credit was extended by the signing of the american taxpayer relief act of  or the act  on january  the act retroactively extended the r e tax credit from january  through december  since the act was enacted during  the income tax benefit related to the r e tax credit will be reflected in our results of operations for the quarter ended march   which we expect will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate

new license sales in our global commercial business increased and new license sales in our us federal government business increased in as compared to this growth in both businesses was driven by year over year growth in core product transaction volume

non gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  this form k includes the following financial measures which are non gaap financial measures under sec rules i non gaap operating income  ii non gaap net income  iii non gaap diluted earnings per share  and iv free cash flow 
each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with gaap 
in this report  these non gaap financial measures exclude stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes  amortization of intangible assets  and acquisition related adjustments  including contingent consideration fair value adjustments due to the changes in probability assumptions of achieving the earnout criteria and due to the passage of time 
each of these non gaap adjustments is described in more detail below 
in addition to these adjustments  management may include or exclude additional items from these or similar non gaap financial measures in future periods to the extent that management believes such items may not be indicative of our core business 
a reconciliation of each of these non gaap financial measures to its most comparable gaap financial measure is also included below 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude certain amounts that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance  allocating resources  preparing annual budgets and determining employee incentive compensation 
accordingly  these non gaap financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision making of management in operating the business 
in addition  by comparing our non gaap financial measures in different historical periods  our investors can evaluate our operating results without the additional variations of certain items that may not be indicative of our core operations  including stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash expense that is not a key measure of our operations 
while we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information  there are limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods  the book value of their assets  their capital structures  the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non gaap measures 
items such as the amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes and acquisition related adjustments  as well as the related tax impacts of these items can have a material impact on operating and net income 
in addition  free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balances for the period 
as a result  these non gaap financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  their most comparable gaap measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using these non gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measure 
investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures below 

table of contents for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable gaap financial measures  the reasons why management uses these measures and the usefulness of these measures  see footnotes below 
non gaap operating income year ended december  in thousands gaap operating income amortization of intangible assets stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes public offering costs lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees reimbursements severance costs related to retirement of former executive chairman acquisition related adjustments non gaap operating income the increase in non gaap operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in and was primarily due to increases in the corresponding gaap operating income  which were driven by higher revenue volumes in the corresponding periods 
amortization of intangible assets  which is excluded from our non gaap operating income  also increased in as compared to and primarily due to increases in intangible assets resulting from the various acquisitions that were completed during and see note  acquisitions of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for additional acquisition details including the intangibles acquired 
stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes increased in as compared to and primarily due to share based incentive awards issued to employees for retention and  to a lesser extent  the addition of employees through acquisitions and organic growth 
the stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes amount includes a one time stock based compensation expense of million from the acceleration of the vesting of certain options related to the retirement of our former executive chairman on june  our acquisition related adjustments fluctuate due to variations in the legal  accounting and advisory fees and restructuring costs associated with each of our acquisitions

table of contents the increase in non gaap net income for year ended december  as compared to the same periods in and was primarily due to increases in the corresponding gaap net income and the adjustments discussed above in the calculation of non gaap operating income 
other adjustments to non gaap net income include fair value adjustments due to the passage of time related to contingent consideration included in acquisition related costs and the tax benefits associated with the excluded items 
non gaap diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in and primarily due to the increase in non gaap net income as discussed above as the number of shares used in the computation did not change significantly 
free cash flow year ended december  in thousands gaap cash flows from operating activities excess tax benefit from stock based compensation purchases of property and equipment free cash flow the increase in free cash flow for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in and was primarily due to the increase in operating income that converted to cash flow 
the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation fluctuates with the exercise of stock option awards 
non gaap footnotes amortization of intangible assets 
we provide non gaap information that excludes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets that primarily relate to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
we believe that eliminating this expense from our non gaap measures is useful to investors  because the amortization of intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions  which also vary in frequency from period to period 
accordingly  we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses 
stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes 
we provide non gaap information that excludes expenses for stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes 
we believe the exclusion of these items allows for financial results that are more indicative of our continuing operations 
we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies  subjective assumptions and the variety of award types 
employer paid payroll taxes on stock based compensation is dependent on our stock price and the timing of the taxable events related to the equity awards  over which our management has little control  and does not correlate to the core operation of our business 
because of these unique characteristics of stock based compensation and the related employer paid payroll taxes  management excludes these expenses when analyzing the organization s business performance 
other items 
we exclude certain other unplanned items which we believe are not indicative of our continuing operations and which amounts and timing are difficult to estimate in advance  including the following  when applicable i write off of debt issuance costs  ii public offering costs  iii lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees  net of related reimbursements from insurance proceeds  and iv severance costs related to retirement of certain executive officers 
although these events are reflected in our gaap financials  these transactions which are not indicative of our continuing operations may limit the comparability of our ongoing operations with prior and future periods 
because of these factors  we assess 
table of contents our operating performance both with these amounts included and excluded  and by providing this information  we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations 
acquisition related adjustments 
we exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including the following  when applicable i amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions see note for further discussion  ii legal  accounting and advisory fees to the extent associated with acquisitions  iii changes in fair value of contingent consideration  iv costs related to integrating the acquired businesses  and v restructuring costs  including adjustments related to changes in estimates  related to acquisitions 
we consider these adjustments  to some extent  to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control 
furthermore  acquisitions result in non continuing operating expenses  which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations  with respect to each acquisition 
we believe that providing non gaap information for acquisition related expense items in addition to the corresponding gaap information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations  and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies  both with and without such adjustments 
income tax effect of non gaap exclusions 
we believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non gaap financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the ongoing performance and future liquidity of our business 
non gaap diluted earnings per share item 
we provide non gaap diluted earnings per share 
the non gaap diluted earnings per share amount was calculated based on our non gaap net income and the shares used in the computation of gaap diluted earnings per share 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities plus the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and less the purchases of property and equipment 
we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that reflects the cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment that can then be used for  among other things  strategic acquisitions and investments in the business  stock repurchases and funding ongoing operations 
free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period 
the changes in free cash flow result from fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities offset by excess tax benefits associated with the exercises of options 
for further discussion regarding cash flows from operating activities  see the discussion under the caption liquidity and capital resources included in this item liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments were million as of december  our international subsidiaries held approximately million of cash and cash equivalents of which was held in euros as of december  we expect our international cash and cash equivalents to continue to increase as a percentage of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents 
we currently intend that the earnings generated by our international operations will be invested indefinitely in those operations and we do not expect to repatriate those earnings to our domestic operations 
if we were to try and repatriate these earnings  we would incur a us federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank demand deposits and money market funds at december  our short term and long term investments  classified as available for sale securities  consist of corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper held in investment accounts in the united states 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
the balances held in our demand deposit accounts in the united states may exceed the federal deposit insurance 
table of contents corporation  or fdic  insurance limits 
while we monitor the balances in our accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or by failure of the underlying depository institutions or guarantors 
we strive to maintain our cash deposits  money market funds and investments with multiple financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore  bear minimal credit risk 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash  cash equivalents  and investments  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our funds will not be impacted by future adverse conditions 
summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is comprised of net income  adjustments primarily related to non cash operating activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
adjustments for non cash benefits expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these adjustments primarily consist of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and excess tax benefits related to employee stock based awards 
stock based compensation expense reduced income before income taxes by million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also recognized a gain on the change in fair value of our acquisition related earnouts of million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  due to adjustments in our probability assumption of achieving the specified earnout criteria 
the change in cash flows relating to operating activities resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities and is primarily driven by the sales of our software and maintenance renewals 
the significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include the following deferred revenue increased to million at december  as compared to million at december   resulting in an increase in operating liabilities and reflecting a cash inflow of million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities increased million and million  respectively  due to an increase in deferred revenue during those years as compared to the respective prior year 
the increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to the increase in the sales of our software and maintenance renewals 
changes in our income tax receivable and payable balances are also significant components of our cash flows from operating activities 
the increase in our income tax payable was primarily due to the growth in our taxable income 
net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by income tax payments of million in  million in  was increased by a us federal income tax refund of million in accounts receivables increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  resulting in an increase in operating assets and reflecting a cash outflow of million for the year ended december  the increase in accounts receivable for the years ended december  and as compared to the respective prior year resulted in cash outflows of million and million  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period 
table of contents to period depending on the timing of our sales  cash collections and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
our accounts receivable balance represents trade receivables from customers  including resellers and distributors  when we have provided software licenses and or software maintenance agreements and we have not yet received payment 
we have historically had insignificant write offs related to bad debts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable divided by b total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by c the number of days in the quarter 
our dso was days and days at december  and  respectively 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities include cash paid for interest payments of million in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to million of cash used to purchase available for sale securities classified as short term and long term investments  million of cash used for acquisitions refer to note  acquisitions  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for additional details and million of proceeds from maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to million of cash used for acquisitions refer to note  acquisitions  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for additional details and million of cash used to purchase available for sale securities classified as short term and long term investments 
also during  we had million of proceeds from maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to the million of cash used in our purchase of certain assets of tek tools 
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal year to be approximately to million 
our estimated capital expenditures for primarily include equipment  software  leasehold improvements and furniture related to the expected growth of our corporate headquarters in austin  texas and our international research and development centers in the czech republic and india 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million of excess tax benefit related to stock based awards  which is a reduction in cash payments related to income taxes 
in addition  for the year ended december   we withheld and retired shares of common stock to satisfy million of minimum statutory withholding tax requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees related to restricted stock units issued during the period 
these shares are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements as of december  also during the year ended december   we paid approximately million of cash upon the achievement of certain earnout objectives related to acquisition accrued earnouts 
the earnout payments of million are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the changes in fair value due to the passage of time of million are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  we reclassified our earnout payments from cash flows from investing activities to cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for further information 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the excess tax benefit related to stock based awards of million  which is a reduction in cash payments related to income taxes 
also during  we paid million of cash to tek tools upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to the asset acquisition in january the earnout payment of million is reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the change in fair value due to the passage of time of million is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was due to a million repayment of long term debt partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a million excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation  which is a reduction in cash payments related to income taxes 
the debt payments in paid off our entire outstanding principal under our first lien note and second lien note 
on august   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  authorizing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the share repurchase program was completed in august  and we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the repurchase was authorized to reflect the confidence of management and the board of directors in our business 
we believed the share repurchase program would generate a positive return to our shareholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
given the low rates of return on cash and short term investments and as there was no outstanding debt at the time of the share repurchase  we believed the share repurchase program was a proper use of our available cash 
anticipated cash flows we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of any acquisitions to expand our business  the timing of expansions to our office facilities  the timing of introductions of new software products and enhancements to existing software products  and the continuing market acceptance of our software offerings 
we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that will enable us to enter new markets or new segments of our existing markets by bringing new product offerings to market more quickly than we can develop them 
although we are not currently a party to any material definitive agreement regarding potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  applications or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements  which could reduce our cash and cash equivalents  require us to seek additional equity or debt financing or repatriate cash generated by our international operations that would cause us to incur a us federal income tax liability 
additional funds from financing arrangements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  including the following interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we also had short term and long term investments classified as available for sale securities of million and million at december  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank demand deposits and money market funds  and our available for sale securities consist primarily of corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper held in investment accounts in the united 
table of contents states 
we hold cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes  and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents  as these consist of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at december  our portfolio of available for sale securities classified as investments is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could impact our future investment income  or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our investment securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
foreign currency risk as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  the foreign currencies that we invoice and on which we collect are the euro  british pound sterling  australian dollar and japanese yen 
expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are  generally  denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary 
our consolidated statements of income are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
during the first quarter of  we began utilizing purchased foreign currency forward contracts to minimize our foreign exchange exposure on certain foreign balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the euro 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow 
the notional amounts and currencies underlying our foreign currency forward contracts will fluctuate period to period as they are principally dependent on the balances of the balance sheet positions that are denominated in currencies other than the euro held by our global entities 
there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuation in currency exchange rates on our results of operational and functional positions 
as of december   we did not have any forward contracts outstanding and while we do not have a formal policy to settle all derivatives prior to the end of each quarter  our current practice is to do so 
see note  derivative instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  for a summary of the effect of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of income 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments  but we do not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings 
in addition  we diversify this risk across several counterparties and actively monitor their ratings 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into u 
s dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss that is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
