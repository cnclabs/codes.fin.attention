item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations research and development expenses for a description of our research and development expenses for the past three fiscal years 
we intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents 
we also intend to expand our design pilot in participation with leading g lte companies domain infrastructure providers  chipset manufacturers  service providers and others and build our secure domain name registry 

index industry overview we believe that the internet is an evolving  rich and complex medium used by individuals and businesses to conduct commerce  share information and engage in real time communications including email  text messaging  im  and voice and video calls 
we believe that users have grown accustomed to having broadband access wherever they go  and not just at home or in the office 
users can browse the internet or send e mails using their mobile broadband enabled notebooks  replace their fixed dsl modems with mobile broadband modems or other devices  and send and receive video or music using g phones 
we believe that long term evolution  or lte  will further advance a transition from the cellular g services to an all internet packet  or ip  based network that can provide mobile data access speeds closer to fixed dsl speeds and allow for more bandwidth intensive applications like interactive tv  mobile video blogging  advanced games or professional services 
session initiation protocol  or sip  was developed to enable the convergence of voice and data networks and today is the predominant industry standard for establishing multimedia communications over the internet such as voice  video  instant messaging  presence information and file transfer 
sip  xmpp and other real time collaboration protocols use dns lookup as the primary means of connecting internet devices 
however  because these protocols use open architecture  we believe that they are inherently unsecure 
we also believe that many enterprises have concluded that security provided to communication by way of an optional add on solution is less secure than security that can be provided by upgrading core information technology  or it  infrastructure systems  networks  and management with integrated security 
we believe that  because of the complexity of today networks and the requirement to connect users from any location at any time on any device  enterprises are reevaluating numerous parts of their technology systems  including but not limited to software solutions for smartphones  routers and switches with integrated security  massive security appliances for data centers  cloud based security services and security solutions for virtualized environments and public and private clouds 
the portions of the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets that could benefit from our software and technology solutions are forecasted by infonetics and our internal estimates to grow from approximately billion of worldwide revenues in to approximately billion by  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of approximately 
we believe that this growing trend represents a significant opportunity for us to license our technology and software  and establish our secure domain name registry 
we also believe that various enterprises have concluded that optional add on solution  and enterprises everywhere are currently upgrading core it infrastructure systems  networks  and management to integrate security into everything 
because of the complexity of today s networks  and the requirement to connect users from any location at any time on any device  enterprise it is having to reevaluate everything from software solutions for smartphones to routers and switches with integrated security  massive security appliances for data centers  cloud based security services  and security solutions for virtualized environments and public and private clouds 
the portions of the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets that could benefit from our software and technology solutions are forecasted by infonetics and our internal estimates to grow from approximately billion of worldwide revenues in to approximately billion by  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of approximately 
we believe that this growing trend represents a significant opportunity for virnetx to license its technology and software  and establish its secure domain name registry 
ip telephony voip  telepresence and video conferencing ip telephony includes technologies that use internet protocol s packet switched connections to exchange voice  fax  and other forms of information traditionally carried over the dedicated circuit switched connections of the public switched telephone network  or pstn 
the adoption of ip telephony has helped businesses significantly lower network operating costs by using a common network for voice and data 
as the workforce becomes increasingly dispersed  mobile features enabled by internet protocol based communications such as presence  unified messaging  peer to peer applications  find me follow me  white boarding and document sharing have become more commonplace 
however  the development of the related security infrastructure has lagged behind  leaving next generation networks vulnerable to a multitude of threats including man in middle  eavesdropping  domain hijacking  distributed denial of service  or ddos  spam over internet telephony  or spit  and spam over instant messaging  or spim 
these threats continue to highlight the need for securing next generation networks 
as the use of ip telephony systems extends beyond the boundaries of an organization s private network  security is likely to become an even bigger concern 
worldwide revenue from ip telephony products like ip pbx including ip phones  service provider voip and ims equipment  voip gateways  enterprise telepresence and video conferencing for businesses is forecasted by infonetics and our internal estimates to grow from approximately billion in to approximately billion in  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe our unique and patented solution provides the robust security platform required for providing on demand secure communication links between enterprises intending to communicate securely without manually configuring the connections 
we believe a standard security solution such as ours will further accelerate the adoption of ip telephony products in the market and allow enterprises to take full advantage of these rich content applications and real time communications over the internet  thereby significantly increasing their return on investment 
unified communications we believe that the need to enhance productivity is rapidly increasing demand for the management of and instant access to real time information 
we believe that mobile collaboration  instant internet access and the ability to conduct business whether inside or outside of the office  are high priorities 
we also believe that the ability to establish multiple secure simultaneous network connections and provide ip sessions with security and encryption will be critical to widespread deployment of next generation networks 
however  one possible shortcoming of this new communications environment is that the various modes of communication operate independently from one another and do not integrate easily  if at all 
we believe that the number of individual points of contact in these environments will grow and that as a result  communication will become more sophisticated and increasingly vulnerable 
an array of communication methodologies integrated into a single communications experience is often referred to as unified communications 
we believe that unified communications have higher utility and can increase productivity for users 
the basic components of unified communications include a directory for storing addresses  various modes of communication with each user contact desk phone  mobile phone  m  etc  message storage for all messages regardless of communication method and secure presence of a user status for each mode of communication available  away  busy  etc worldwide unified communications market generated approximately million in revenue in and is forecasted to grow rapidly over the next few years generating approximately billion in revenue in  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe the growth in unified communication products may not reach its full potential due to the lack of transparent and seamless security as users hesitate to place their presence information online for all to see and as organizations block access due to the lack of credentials verified by a neutral third party 
we believe that our solutions help address these concerns and should enable significant growth in the unified communications market 
ip mobility lte  fixed mobile convergence we believe that telecommunication markets are rapidly changing and presenting new challenges to the equipment and service providers  including but not limited to increasing user demand for mobile  always on connections with multiple devices 
we also believe that traffic growth  video acceleration  cloud services and a rapidly growing number of subscribers challenge currently available network architectures and that  because of this  service providers and carriers will eventually use a single network for fixed and mobile communications  private premium communications and internet access  in spite of the difficulties involved challenging their business models and forcing the consideration of new network architectures 
we believe that lte technology will deliver users the benefits of faster data speeds and new services by creating a new radio access technology that optimized for ip based traffic and offers operators a simple upgrade path from g networks 
smartphones are multi functional devices that handle a wide variety of business critical applications and support increasingly complex functions including enhanced data processing  internet access  e mail access  calendars and scheduling  contact management and the ability to view electronic documents 
users have continual access to these applications while on the move making them an increasingly essential business tool for the mobile worker 
these devices enable mobile workers to have similar functionality inside or outside the office thereby increasing employee efficiency 
however  it is critical that this mobile environment have the same level of security as an enterprise internal network 
fixed mobile convergence is an environment where wired and wireless phones work together with internet protocol to deliver services voice  video  data and combinations thereof uniformly across multiple access networks  including  among others  wimax  wifi cellular and fixed 
worldwide revenue from ip mobility products like smartphones and mobile data cards  femtocell equipment  rich communication devices and services is expected to grow from approximately billion in to approximately billion by  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe in order to realize the full functionality of ip mobility  several challenges including security must be overcome 
when users are mobile  connections and data need to cross multiple network boundaries  each of which poses a security threat 
wireless networks may be threatened or compromised by rogue users who enter through insecure wireless access points 
we believe that providing authenticated access to the wireless networks and enterprise applications through the wireless domain are important requirements and represent a significant market opportunity for our patented technology and secure domain names to provide users fully authenticated secure access on a zero click or single click basis

highly experienced research and development team 
our research and development team is comprised of nationally recognized network security and encryption technology scientists and experts that have worked together as a team for over ten years 
during their careers  this team has developed several cutting edge technologies for us national defense  intelligence and civilian agencies  many of which remain critical to our national security today 
prior to joining virnetx  our team worked for saic during which time they invented the technology that is the foundation of our technology  and software 
based on the collective knowledge and experience of our development team  we believe that we have one of the most experienced and sophisticated groups of security experts researching vulnerability and threats to real time communication over the internet and developing solutions to mitigate these problems 
our strategy our strategy is to become the market leader in securing real time communications over the internet and to establish our gabriel communications technology as the industry standard security platform 
key elements of our strategy are to implement a technology licensing program to commercialize our intellectual property  including our gabriel connection technology 
establish virnetx as the exclusive universal registry of secure domain names and to enable our customers to act as registrars for their users and broker secure communication between users on different registries 
leverage our existing technology to develop a suite of products that can be sold directly to end user enterprises 
we have submitted a declaration with the rd generation partnership project  or gpp  identifying a group of our patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to certain developing specifications in the gpp lte  sae project 
we have agreed to make available a non exclusive patent license under fair  reasonable and non discriminatory terms and conditions  with compensation  or frand  to gpp members desiring to implement the technical specifications identified by us 
we have also submitted a number of updates to our original declaration  identifying additional technical specifications that would also require a license to our us and international patents 

index license and service offerings we plan to offer a diversified portfolio of license and service offerings focused on securing real time communications over the internet  including virnetx technology licensing customers who want to develop their own implementation of the virnetx code module for supporting secure domain names  or who want to use their own techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure communication links  will purchase a technology license 
we anticipate that these licenses would typically include an initial license fee  as well as an ongoing royalty 
we expect that these licenses will include a one time delivery of gabriel software development kit including object libraries  sample code  testing and quality assurance tools and the supporting documentation necessary for a customer to implement of the techniques we have developed 
gabriel connection technology software development kit or sdk oem customers who want to adopt the gabriel connection technology as their solution for establishing secure connections using secure domain names within their products will purchase an sdk license 
the software development kit consists of object libraries  sample code  testing and quality assurance tools and the supporting documentation necessary for a customer to implement our technology 
these tools are comprised of software for a secure domain name connection test server  a relay test server and a registration test server 
we expect that customers would pay an up front license fee to purchase an sdk license and a royalty fee for every product shipped with the embedded virnetx code module 
secure domain name registrar service customers  including service providers  telecommunication companies  isps  system integrators and oems could purchase a license to our secure domain name registrar service 
we would provide the software suite and technology support to enable such customers to provision devices with secure domain names and facilitate secure connections between registered devices 
this suite includes the following server software modules registrar server software we anticipate that our registrar server software would enable customers to operate as a secure domain name registrar that provisions devices with secure domain names 
the registrar server software is designed to provide an interface for our customers to register new virtual private domains and sub domain names 
this server module must be enrolled with the virnetx secure domain name master registry to obtain its credentials before functioning as an authorized registrar 
connection server software we anticipate that our connection server software would allow customers to provide connection services to enrolled devices 
the connection services include registration of presence information for authenticated users and devices  presence information query request services  enforcement of policies and support for communication with peers behind firewalls 
relay server software we anticipate that our relay server software would allow customers to dynamically maintain connections and relay data to private ip addresses for network devices that reside behind firewalls 
secure domain name registrar service customers will enter into a technology licensing and revenue sharing agreement with virnetx whereby we will typically receive an up front licensing fee for the secure domain name registrar technology  as well as ongoing annual royalties for each secure domain name issued by the customer 
secure domain name master registry and connection service as part of enabling the secure domain name registrar service  we expect that we will maintain and manage the secure domain name master registry 
this service is expected to enroll all secure domain name registrar customers and generate the credentials required to function as an authorized registrar 
it also is expected to provide connection services and universal name resolution  presence information and secure connections between authorized devices with secure domain names

we intend to leverage this experience and continue investing in research and development and  over time  expect to strengthen and expand our patent portfolio  technology  and software 
while we are currently focused on securing real time communications over the internet and establishing the first and only secure domain name registry  we believe our existing and future intellectual property portfolio will extend to additional areas including  among others  network security and operating systems for fixed and mobile devices 
customers in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit against microsoft corporation in  microsoft became our first licensee 
pursuant to the settlement and license agreement between us and microsoft  microsoft paid us million  which has been recognized as gain on settlement and microsoft was granted a worldwide  irrevocable  nonexclusive  non sub licensable fully paid up license for our patents for microsoft products 
we have also signed patent license agreements with aastra usa  inc mitel networks corporation  nec corporation and nec corporation of america  siemens enterprise communications gmbh co 
kg  and siemens enterprise communications inc to license certain of our us patents  for a one time payment and an ongoing royalty for all future sales through the expiration of the licensed patents with respect to certain current and future ip encrypted products 
we intend to seek further license of our technology  including our gabriel connection technology to developers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  of chips  servers  smart phones  tablets  e readers  laptops  net books and other devices  within the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets including g lte 
we have published our royalty rates and guidelines on our website 
all forward moving licenses have adhered to these guidelines and have met or exceeded these rates and we will use these rates and guidelines in all future license negotiations 

index marketing and sales we plan to employ a leveraged  partner oriented  marketing strategy for our technology licenses and software offerings 
we expect the marketing strategy will primarily be focused on oems 
we plan to directly market our domain name registry services to our service provider and system integrator customers 
we hope to leverage our relationship with saic to extend our offering to departments and agencies within the federal government 
saic is a fortune scientific  engineering and technology applications company that uses its deep domain knowledge to solve problems of vital importance to the nation and the world  in national security  energy and the environment  critical infrastructure  and health 
we intend to build a sales force that will be responsible for managing accounts and pursuing technology licensing and sales opportunities with new customers 
competition we believe our technology and solutions will compete primarily against various proprietary security solutions 
we group these solutions into three main categories proprietary or home grown application specific security solutions have been developed by vendors and integrated directly into their products for our target markets including ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence  and unified communications 
these proprietary solutions have been developed due to the lack of standardized approaches to securing real time communications 
this approach has led to corporate networks that are isolated and  as a result  restrict enterprises to using these next generation networks within the boundaries of their private network 
these solutions generally do not provide security for communications over the internet or require network administrators to manually exchange keys and other security parameters with each destination network outside their corporate network boundary 
the cost savings and other benefits of ip based real time communications are significantly limited by this approach to securing real time communications 
a session border controller  or sbc  is a device used in networks to exert control over the signaling and media streams involved in establishing  conducting and terminating voip calls 
a traditional firewall or network address translation  or nat  device typically block information like endpoint ip addresses and port numbers required by signaling protocols  such as sip and xmpp  to reach and communicate with their intended destination 
sbcs are used in physical networks to address these limitations and enable real time session traffic to cross the boundaries created by firewalls and other nat devices and enable voip calls to be established successfully 
however  sbcs must decrypt and analyze every single data packet for the information to be transmitted successfully  thereby preventing end to end encryption 
this network design results in sbcs becoming a single point of congestion on the network  as well as a single point of failure 
sbcs are also limited to the physical network they secure 
sip firewalls  or sip aware firewalls  and application layer gateways  manage and protect the traffic  flow and quality of voip and other sip related communications 
they perform real time network address translation  dynamic firewall functions  support multiple signaling protocols  and media functionality  allowing secure interconnection and the flow of ip media streams across multiple networks 
while sip firewalls assist in analyzing sip traffic transmitted over the corporate network to filter out various threats  they do not necessarily encrypt the traffic 
as a result  this traffic is not entirely secure from end to end nor is it protected against threats like man in middle and eavesdropping 
intellectual property and patent rights our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets  patented know how  issued and pending patents  copyrights and technological innovation 
we have a portfolio comprised of twenty patents in the united states and thirty two foreign patents as well as several pending us and foreign patent applications 
our portfolio includes a number of patents that describe unique systems and methods for securing real time communications over the internet  as well as related services such as the establishment and maintenance of a secure domain name registry 
our software and technology solutions also have additional applications relating to operating systems and network security 
we have included a list of our us patents below

index assignment of patents some of our issued patents and pending patent applications were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary  virnetx  inc  from science applications international corporation  or saic  pursuant to an assignment agreement dated december   and a patent license and assignment agreement dated august   as amended on november   including documents prepared pursuant to the november amendment  and as further amended on march  we recorded the assignment from saic with the us patent office on december  key terms of these agreements are as follows patent assignment 
saic unconditionally and irrevocably conveyed  transferred  assigned and quitclaimed all its right  title and interest in and to the patents and patent applications  as specifically set forth on exhibit a to the assignment document recorded with the us patent office  including  without limitation  the right to sue for past infringement 
license to saic outside the field of use 
on november   we granted to saic an exclusive  royalty free  fully paid  perpetual  worldwide  irrevocable  sub licensable and transferable right and license permitting saic and its assignees to make  have made  import  use  offer for sale  and sell products and services covered by  and to make improvements to  the patents and patent applications we acquired from saic  solely outside our field of use 
we have  and retain  all right  title and interest to all our patents within our field of use 
on march   saic relinquished the november   exclusive right and license outside our field of use referred to above  as well as any right to obtain such exclusive license in the future 
effective march   we granted to saic a non exclusive  royalty free  fully paid  perpetual  worldwide  irrevocable  sub licensable and transferable right and license permitting saic and its assignees to make  have made  import  use  offer for sale  and sell products and services covered by  and to make improvements to  the patents and patent applications we acquired from saic  solely outside our field of use 
compensation obligations 
as consideration for the assignment of the patents and for the rights we obtained from saic as amended  we are required to make payments to saic based on cash or certain other values generated from those patents 
the amount of such payments depends upon the type of value generated  and certain categories are subject to maximums and other limitations 
as of june   we met our maximum royalty payment requirement  however  saic is also entitled under certain circumstances to receive a portion of the proceeds paid to us for certain acquisitions of virnetx  from the settlement of certain patent infringement claims of ours 
government regulation the laws governing online secure communications remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property  privacy and libel apply to online communications and media 
such legislation may interfere with the growth in use of online secure communications and decrease the acceptance of online secure communications as a viable solution  which could adversely affect our business 
due to the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws regulating secure communications may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover  among other things  issues relating to privacy  pricing  taxation  telecommunications over the internet  content  copyrights  distribution and quality of products and services 
we intend to comply with all new laws and regulations as they are adopted 
the us government has controlled the authoritative domain name system  or dns  root server since the inception of the internet 
on july   the president of the united states directed the us secretary of commerce to privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases competition and facilitates international participation in its management 
on september   the us department of commerce extended its delegation of authority by entering into a new agreement with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  or icann  a california non profit corporation headquartered in marina del rey  california 
icann is responsible for managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage the assignment of top level domain names associated with the authoritative dns root directory 
although it is possible to create and manage other dns root directories privately without accreditation from icann  the possibility of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users would widely adopt a top level domain name associated with an alternative dns root directory provided by a non icann accredited registry service 
we are currently evaluating whether we will apply to become an icann accredited registry provider with respect to one or more customized generic top level domain gtld  or create our own alternative dns root directory to manage the assignment of non standard secure domain names 
we have not yet begun discussions with icann and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining icann accreditation for our registry service on terms acceptable to us or at all 
whether or not we obtain accreditation from icann  we will be subject to the ongoing risks arising out of the delegation of the us government s responsibilities for the domain name system to the us department of commerce and icann and the evolving government regulatory environment with respect to domain name registry services

risk factors 
we face a variety of risks that may affect our business  financial condition  operating results  the trading price of our common stock  or any combination thereof 
you should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this form k in evaluating our business and prospects and before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock 
if any of these risks were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in such an event  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
we may not be able to capitalize on market opportunities related to our licensing strategy or our patent portfolio 
our business strategy includes licensing our patents and technology to other companies in order to reach a larger end user base than we could reach through direct sales and marketing efforts  as such our business strategy and revenues will depend on intellectual property licensing fees and royalties for the majority of our revenues 
we currently derive nominal revenue from licensing activities and we cannot assure you that we will successfully capitalize on our market opportunities or that our current business strategy will succeed 
factors that may affect our ability to execute our current business strategy including  but are not limited to although we have to date entered into a limited number of settlement and license agreements  we may not be successful in entering into further licensing relationships and existing settlement and license agreements may not generate the financial results we expect  third parties may challenge the validity of our patents  the pendency of our various litigations may cause potential licensees not to do business with us  we expect that we will face intense competition new and established competitors who may have superior products and services or better marketing  financial or other capacities than we do  and it is possible that one or more of our potential customers or licensees develops or otherwise sources products or technologies similar to  competitive with or superior to ours 
if we are not able to adequately protect our patent rights  our business would be negatively impacted 
we believe our patents are valid  enforceable and valuable 
notwithstanding this belief  third parties may make claims of infringement or invalidity claims with respect to our patents and such claims could give rise to material cost for defense or settlement or both  jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome of litigation we are or may become involved in  divert resources away from our other activities  or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business 
similar challenges could also prevent us from obtaining additional patents in the future 
even if we are successful in enforcing our rights  our patents may not ultimately provide us with any competitive advantages and may be less valuable than we currently expect 
these risks may be heightened in countries other than the united states  and may be negatively affected by the fact that legal standards in the united states and elsewhere for protection of intellectual property rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and still evolving 
in addition  there are a significant number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest  and we expect that significant litigation in these areas will continue  and will add uncertainty to the value of certain patents and other intellectual property rights in our areas of interest 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or otherwise realize value from them  our business would be negatively affected 
our litigation can be time consuming  costly and we cannot anticipate the results 
we spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation matters 
we believe that these litigation matters and others that we may in the future determine to pursue could continue for years and continue to consume significant financial and management resources 
the counterparties to our litigation are all large  well financed companies with substantially greater resources than us 
we cannot assure you that any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us 
in addition  even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters  they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the dispute 
also  we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly or impossible for us to defend 
unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses  exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize products 
we can provide no assurances that the licensing of our essential security patents under frand will be successful 
at the request of the european telecommunications standards institute etsi  and the alliance for telecommunications industry solutions atis  we agreed to update our licensing declaration to etsi and atis under their respective intellectual property rights ipr policies 
this was in response to our statement of patent holder identifying a group of our patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to certain developing specifications in the rd generation partnership project gpp long term evolution lte  systems architecture evolution sae project 
we will make available a non exclusive patent license under frand fair  reasonable and non discriminatory terms and conditions  with compensation for the patents identified by virnetx that are or become essential  to applicants desiring to implement the technical specifications identified by virnetx  as set forth in the updated licensing declaration under the atis and etsi ipr policies 
while we believe that our frand commitment positions us to license our essential security patents for the technical specifications identified by virnetx  our licensing declarations under the atis and etsi ipr policies may limit our flexibility in determining royalties and license terms for certain of our patents 
consequently  we cannot assure you that the licensing of the essential security patents will be successful or that third parties will be willing to enter into licenses with virnetx on reasonable terms or at all  which could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive position 
because our business is conducted or expected to be conducted in an environment that is subject to rapid change  we may be subjected to various developments in regulation  law and consumer preferences to which we may not be able to adapt successfully 
the current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear 
we can give no assurance that our planned product offerings will be in compliance with laws and regulations of local  state  united states federal or foreign authorities 
further  we can give no assurance that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or regulations or that such laws or regulations will not be modified  or that new laws or regulations will be enacted in the future which would cause us to be in violation of such laws or regulations 
for example  voice over internet protocol or voip services are not currently subject to all of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony  but it is possible that similar regulations may be applied to voip in the future and that these could result in substantial costs and adversely effect the marketability of our products and planned products related to voip 
for further example  the use of the internet and private internet protocol ip networks for communication is largely unregulated within the united states  but may become regulated in the future  also several foreign governments have enacted measures that could restrict or prohibit voice communications services over the internet or private ip networks 

index our business depends on the growth of instant messaging  voip  mobile services  streaming video  file transfer and remote desktop and other next generation internet based applications which are relatively new 
a decline in the use of these applications due to complexity or cost of these applications relative to alternate traditional or newly developed communications channels  or development of alternative technologies  could cause a material decline in the number of users in these areas 
more aggressive domestic or international regulation of the internet in general  and internet telephony providers and services specifically  or a lack of growth in acceptance of the internet as a long term viable marketplace for communications services  may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and future prospects 
our exposure to outside influences beyond our control  including new legislation  court rulings or actions by the united states patent and trademark office  could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and results of operations 
our licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences  including the following new legislation  regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue 
for instance  the us supreme court has recently modified some tests used by the united states patent and trademark office uspto in granting patents during the past years which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of challenge of any patents we obtain or license 
in addition  the us recently enacted sweeping changes to the united states patent system under the leahy smith america invents act aia  including changes that transition the united states from a first to invent system to a first to file system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents more patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the uspto 
federal courts are becoming more crowded  and as a result  patent enforcement litigation is taking longer 
if we experience security breaches  we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 
we expect to retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and secure domain name registry 
it will be critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
our secure domain name registry operations will also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption  and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system 
the secure domain name servers that we will operate will be critical hardware to our registry services operations 
therefore  we expect to have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure 
security technologies are constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
advances in the techniques for attacking security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
likewise  if any of our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the vulnerabilities and to repair or replace products already sold or licensed to our customers 
despite our security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems 
it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems 
any physical or electronic break in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers 
in such an event  we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services 
such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as the security or reliability of our services 
a security breach could require a substantial amount of expense to rectify and could result in a product liability claim that causes us to incur substantial liability and related legal and other costs 
a security breach may also harm our reputation and make it more difficult or impossible for us to successfully market to others 
these matters could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our operating results 
we expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as the need to educate potential customers about our patent rights and our product and service capabilities  customers willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  customers budgetary constraints  the timing of customers budget cycles  and delays caused by customers internal review processes 
long sales cycles may increase the risk that our financial resources are exhausted before we are able to generate significant revenue 
we expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers 
if we are unable to establish  maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base  our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited 
we expect that in the future  a significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers 
substantially all of our income during was from the payments to us resulting from the settlement and license agreement we entered into with microsoft 
nominal revenues from and were derived from a single licensing agreement and revenues were derived from settlement and license agreements entered into as we settled lawsuits we initiated against customers for patent infringements 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers  or if we do so  to sustain our revenue levels from these prospective customers 
if we are not able to establish  maintain or replace the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future  or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate  our ability to maintain or grow our revenues will be adversely affected 

index our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors  which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business 
our products are highly technical and complex and  when deployed  may contain errors or defects 
despite testing  some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers 
any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance  loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition  loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty  including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners 
the performance of our products could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third party applications and services that utilize our services  which could result in legal claims against us  harming our business 
furthermore  we expect to provide implementation  consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products  which typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
we expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations  which may not be upheld 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  is costly and may divert management s attention and adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
malfunctions of third party communications infrastructure  hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control 
our business will also depend upon the capacity  reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that we will use to deploy our offerings 
we have no control over the operation  quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment 
we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections 
if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future  our operations could be severely interrupted 
also  to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases  the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions 
system interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the appeal of the networks to users 
in addition  users depend on real time communications  outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures 
these types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees  strategic partners and customers 
system failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business 
the success of our license and service offerings will depend on the uninterrupted operation of various systems  secure data centers and other computer and communication networks that we establish 
to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases  the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times  service interruptions or delays or system failures 
our systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss  transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures  damage or interruption caused by fire  earthquake  and other natural disasters computer viruses or software defects  and physical or electronic break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism  terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control 
system interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the appeal of the networks to users 
these types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees  strategic partners and customers 
any significant problem with our systems or operations could result in lost revenue  customer dissatisfaction or lawsuits against us 
a failure in the operation of our secure domain name registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain secure domain names for a period of time 
a failure in the operation or update of the master directory that we plan to maintain could result in deletion or discontinuation of assigned secure domain names for a period of time 
the inability of the registrar systems we establish  including our back office billing and collections infrastructure  and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of an increasing number of secure domain name requests could result in substantial degradation in our customer support service and our ability to process registration requests in a timely manner 
our ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support  and our failure to deliver high quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products  succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support  or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able achieve to the foregoing  our ability to sell our products would be adversely affected  and our reputation with potential customers could be harmed 
in addition  as we expand our operations internationally  our technical support team will face additional challenges  including those associated with delivering support  training and documentation in languages other than english 
our failure to deliver and maintain high quality technical support services to our customers could result in customers choosing to use our competitors products instead of ours in the future 
telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs  which  if granted  would increase the cost of online communication  and such increase in cost may impede the growth of online communication and adversely affect our business 
use of the internet has over burdened existing telecommunications infrastructures  and many high traffic areas have begun to experience interruptions in service 
as a result  certain local telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs on ip telephony traffic that crosses over their traditional telephone networks 
if the relief sought in these petitions is granted  the costs of communicating via online could increase substantially  potentially adversely affecting the growth in the use of online secure communications 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business 

index the departure of kendall larsen  our chief executive officer and president  and or other key personnel could compromise our ability to execute our strategic plan and may result in additional severance costs to us 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our key personnel  including kendall larsen  our chief executive officer and president 
we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at any time 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees 
the loss of mr 
larsen  or our failure to retain other key personnel  would jeopardize our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business 
we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations  marketing and sales personnel as well as engineers 
inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
competition for engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel is intense  particularly in the technology and internet sectors and in the region in which our facility is located 
we can provide no assurance that we will attract or retain such personnel 
our consolidated financial statements were restated in in connection with our identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  we may identify future material weakness which may result in late filings  increased costs or declines in our share price 
in early  we restated our previously filed financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended september   each of the then previous five fiscal quarters and the fiscal year ended december   to adjust our accounting for our series i warrants 
in connection with these restatements  we determined that we had not maintained effective control over our accounting for these series i warrants and  as a result  that a material weakness existed with respect to our reporting of complex  non routine transactions as of the end of the periods covered by the form k and form qs that included the financial statements referenced above 
although we believe that we currently maintain effective control over our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as regards this issue  we may in the future identify deficiencies regarding the design and effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting 
if we experience any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting the future or are unable to provide unqualified management or attestation reports about our internal controls  we may be unable to meet financial and other reporting deadlines and may incur costs associated with remediation  and any of which could cause our share price to decline 
we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments 
although we paid a special cash dividend to holders of our common stock with a record date of july   we do not currently pay regular dividends on our common stock and instead retain future earnings to fund our business plan 
our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors  including our business  financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  and investment opportunities 
we therefore can t assure you that our board of directors will determine to pay regular or special dividends in the future 
accordingly  unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends  stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment 
this appreciation may not occur 
the exercise of our outstanding stock options would result in a dilution of our current stockholders voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock 
the exercise of our outstanding vested stock options would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
as of december   we had outstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock representing of our total shares outstanding as of december  of which  are vested and therefore exercisable 
to the extent outstanding stock options are exercised  additional shares of common stock will be issued  and such issuance would dilute non exercising stockholders percentage voting interests and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market 
the fair value of accounting for our series i warrants as derivative liabilities may materially impact our results of our operations in future periods 
we record the series i warrants as a derivative liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity 
these derivative liabilities are reported at fair value each reporting period with changes in the fair value recognized as gain or loss during each reporting period 
an increase in our share price or measure of our share price volatility  for example  will generally result in an increase in the fair value of our warrant liability and a non cash charge during the period of such increase  which could materially and negatively impact our results of operations in future periods 
trading in our common shares is limited and the price of our common shares may be subject to substantial volatility  particularly in light of the instability in the financial and capital markets 
our common stock is listed on nyse amex  but its daily trading volume has been limited  sporadic and volatile 
over the past years the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations 
between january   and december   the reported last sale price for our common stock ranged between and per share 
the price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but not limited to  the following developments in any then outstanding litigation  quarterly variations in our operating results  large purchases or sales of common stock or derivatives transactions related to our stock  actual or anticipated announcements of new products or services by us or competitors  general conditions in the markets in which we compete  and economic and financial conditions 

index the market price of our common stock may decline because our operating results may not be consistent and may be difficult to predict 
our reported net income has fluctuated in the past due to several factors 
we expect that our future operating results may also fluctuate due to the same or similar factors 
we had net income of million for the year ended december   a net loss of million for the year ended december   and a net loss million for the year ended december  with an accumulated deficit of million 
the following include some of the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate the outcome of actions to enforce our intellectual property rights currently in progress or that we may undertake in the future  and the timing thereof  the amount and timing of receipt of license fees from potential infringers  licensees or customers  the rate of adoption of our patented technologies  the number of new license arrangements we may execute  or that may expire  within a particular period and the scope of those licenses  including the number of our patents which are licensed  the extent of prior infringement of our patent rights  royalty rates  timing of payment obligations  expiration date etc  the success of a licensee in selling products that use our patented technologies  and the amount and timing of expenses related to our patent filings and enforcement proceedings  including litigation  related to our intellectual property rights 
these fluctuations may make our business particularly difficult to manage  adversely affect our business and operating results  make our operating results difficult for investors to predict and  further  cause our results to fall below investor s expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because ownership of our common stock is concentrated  investors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions 
as of december   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
in addition  a group of stockholders that  as of december   held  shares  or approximately  of our then outstanding common stock  have entered into a voting agreement with us that requires them to vote all of their shares of our voting stock in favor of the director nominees approved by our board of directors at each director election going forward  and in a manner that is proportional to the votes cast by all other voting shares as to any other matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote 
however  we cannot be certain how many shares of our common stock this group of stockholders currently owns 
because of their beneficial ownership interest  our officers and directors could significantly influence stockholder actions of which you disapprove or that are contrary to your interests 
this ability to exercise significant influence could prevent or significantly delay another company from acquiring or merging with us 
our protective provisions could make it difficult for a third party to successfully acquire us even if you would like to sell your stock to them 
we have a number of protective provisions that could delay  discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
our protective provisions include a staggered board of directors this means that only one or two directors since we have a five person board of directors will be up for election at any given annual meeting 
this has the effect of delaying the ability of stockholders to effect a change in control of us because it would take two annual meetings to effectively replace a majority of the board of directors 
blank check preferred stock our board of directors has the authority to establish the rights  preferences and privileges of our  authorized  but unissued  shares of preferred stock 
therefore  this stock may be issued at the discretion of our board of directors with preferences over your shares of our common stock in a manner that is materially dilutive to you 
in addition  blank check preferred stock can be used to create a poison pill which is designed to deter a hostile bidder from buying a controlling interest in our stock without the approval of our board of directors 
we have not adopted such a poison pill  but our board of directors has the ability to do so in the future  very rapidly and without stockholder approval 
advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of the stockholders must provide notice to us within very specific date windows and in very specific form in order to have the matter voted on at a stockholder meeting 
this has the effect of giving our board of directors and management more time to react to stockholder proposals generally and could also have the effect of disregarding a stockholder proposal or deferring it to a subsequent meeting to the extent such proposal is not raised properly 
no stockholder actions by written consent no stockholder or group of stockholders may take actions rapidly and without prior notice to our board of directors and management or to the minority stockholders 
along with the advance notice requirements described above  this provision also gives our board of directors and management more time to react to proposed stockholder actions 
super majority requirement for stockholder amendments to the by laws stockholder proposals to alter or amend our by laws or to adopt new by laws can only be approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
no ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders only the board of directors or management can call special meetings of the stockholders 
this could mean that stockholders  even those who represent a significant percentage of our shares of common stock  may need to wait for the annual meeting before nominating directors or raising other business proposals to be voted on by the stockholders 

index in addition  the provisions of section of the delaware general corporate law govern us 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

on november   a jury in the united states court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division  awarded us over  in a verdict against apple corporation for infringing four of our patents 
a post trial hearing in the case against apple was held on december  on february   the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division issued its memorandum opinion and order regarding post trial motions resulting from the prior jury verdict 
the court denied apple s motion to reduce the damages awarded by the jury for past infringement 
the court further denied apple s request for a new trial on the liability and damages portions of the verdict 
additionally  the court granted our motions for pre judgment interest  post judgment interest  and post verdict damages to date 
specifically  the court ordered that apple pay  in daily interest up to final judgment and  in daily damages for infringement up to final judgment for certain apple devices included in the verdict 
the court denied our request for a permanent injunction 
in doing so  the court ordered the parties to mediate over a license in the following days for apple s future infringing use not covered by the court s order

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the critical accounting policies we employ in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those which involve impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  fair value of financial instruments and stock based compensation 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
in doing so  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in some cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates  which we discuss further below 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements can be complex and may or may not include multiple elements 
these agreements may include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents  patent licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  and the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements 
beginning january   licensing agreements are accounted for under the financial accounting standards board fasb revenue recognition guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance requires consideration to be allocated to each element of an agreement that has stand alone value using the relative fair value method 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented technology in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the guidance for revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the licensee 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in specific applications and products consideration for past sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented technology prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive royalty for past sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
these amounts are negotiated based upon application of a royalty rate to historical sales prior to the execution of the license agreement 
in each of these cases  since delivery has occurred  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price  and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
current royalty payments these are ongoing royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
licensees that owe current royalty payments are obligated to provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we expect to receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
as a result  it is impractical for us to recognize revenue in the period in which the underlying sales occur  and  in most cases  we will recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our licensees  our visibility into our licensees sales is limited 
current royalty payments will be calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 

index earnings per share basic earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period 
diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued 
during and we incurred losses  therefore  the effect of any common stock equivalent is anti dilutive during those periods 
concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties our cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained at two financial institutions in the united states 
deposits held with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
the balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
during the year ended december   and  we had  at times  funds that were uninsured 
we do not believe that we are subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
derivative instruments our series i warrants contain an anti dilution provision which prevents them from being considered indexed to our stock 
as a result  the warrants are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments 
we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
we record changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of the derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  but not less than annually 
recoverability is measured by comparison of the anticipated future net undiscounted cash flows to the related assets carrying value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
because of our history of operating losses  we do not currently recognize the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets  including tax loss carry forwards  that may be used to offset future taxable income 
we continually assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized 
if and when we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in our statements of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the fair value recognition method 
we recognize these compensation costs net of the applicable forfeiture rate and recognize the compensation costs for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of years 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience 
in addition  we record stock and options granted to non employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued as they vest over the performance period 
fair value we apply fair value accounting to all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
our financial instruments are stated at amounts that equal  or are intended to approximate  fair value 
when we approximate fair value  we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument  including assumptions about risk and inputs to the valuation technique 
we use quoted valuation techniques  primarily the income and market approach that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs for recurring fair value measurements 

index new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update  which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements based on unobservable inputs 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position  when adopted on january  on january  the fasb issued an update to an existing accounting standard the objective of which is to clarify the scope of accounting standards update no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  would apply to derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with section or section or are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
management does not expect adoption to have an effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
on february  the fasb issued an amendment to a prior update of existing standards 
the amendments in this update supersede and replace the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asus issued in june and issued in december for all public and private organizations 
the amendments would require an entity to provide additional information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
management does not expect adoption to have an effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting guidance was issued in to require more prominent disclosure of comprehensive income 
this guidance was effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  and requires the presentation of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
we elected to present two separate but consecutive statements 
new accounting guidance was issued in february that requires the presentation of information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component for each reporting period 
this guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of and is not expected to have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  new accounting guidance was issued in and which was intended to reduce the complexity and costs of performing annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset testing by allowing companies the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
operations all amounts in this section are expressed in thousands revenue revenue revenue generated for the year ended december  was approximately compared to for the year ended december  and for the twelve months ended december  our revenue in  was as a result of entering into license agreements with our customers 
in and  revenue was solely limited to the royalties earned under our single license agreement through our japanese subsidiary 
we expect the revenue from this license will continue to be insignificant in the future 
we do not intend to seek additional licenses or other revenue through our japanese subsidiary 
gain on settlement in june  we received  from microsoft corporation related to a licensing agreement 
we determined that we could not practically and objectively separate any settlement portion from the revenue element as discussed under the guidance of us gaap accounting standards codification topic revenue recognition  or asc topic as a result  this amount was classified as a gain on settlement 
this reclassification had no impact on our net income  financial position or cash flows for any period 
we did not receive a gain on settlement for the twelve months ended december  or  respectively 
royalty expense there was no royalty expense for the years ended december  and compared to  for the year ended december  under our agreements with saic  we were obligated to pay saic of the proceeds from the settlement of litigation with microsoft after reduction for costs  including legal fees and expenses  incurred by us and saic in connection with the microsoft litigation 
research and development expenses research and development research and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation related expenses for our engineering staff 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to the increase in bonuses paid in compared to the increase in as compared to and  was primarily due to the increase in wages due to the dividend payment paid to our research and development staff 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administration selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation expense for management and administrative personnel  as well as expenses for outside legal  accounting  and consulting services 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in and in was primarily due to the increase in legal fees associated with the settlement of the aastra  mitel and nec cases as well as the ongoing apples  cisco and avaya cases in and the microsoft litigation in legal fees represent approximately of general and administrative expenses for as compared to for and for within selling  general and administrative expenses  legal fees for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to the increase in legal fees associated with the settlement of the microsoft litigation 
other income and expenses other income and expense our non cash loss related to the periodic revaluation of our series i warrants liability for the year ended december  was compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  our non cash loss related to the periodic revaluation of our series i warrants liability decreased by  in the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period in as a result of a higher common share price and warrant exercises during the year ended interest income for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  these changes are due to timing on the maturity of the investments as well as the amount of cash available for investments 

index liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  and our short term investments totaled  compared to  and  respectively  for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  as of december  before entering into the microsoft settlement  we allocated a large amount of cash to legal fees and other expenses associated with the microsoft litigation 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of december   will be sufficient to fund our operations and provide working capital for general corporate purposes and legal expenses including the expenses for our ongoing complaints against apple  cisco  siemens and avaya in the united states district court of the eastern district of texas  tyler division  as well as the complaint with the us international trade commission  for at least the next months 
while we do not expect to generate net income in the near term similar to in the net income generated during the year ended december   generally attributable to the microsoft settlement  we do expect to derive the majority of our future revenue from license fees and royalties associated with our patent portfolio  technology  software and secure domain name registry in the united states and other markets around the world over the long term 
however  we will not receive any proceeds from these claims unless and until they may be resolved in our favor  and we expect to continue to incur substantial legal and other costs associated with pursuit of our claims 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest expense  and commitments as of december  operating obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the time deposits  money market  and corporate debt securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
investments in fixed rate earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our income from investments may decrease in the future 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term but would have an immaterial impact in the fair value of our marketable securities as they will be maturing in six months or less 
although we have no obligation to settle our series i warrant obligations in cash or an unknown number of shares  the embedded liability in the series i warrant obligations is recorded at estimated fair value 
that estimated fair value is determined in large part by reference to our assumptions and estimates of various factors 
notably  our liability will increase and we may incur significant non cash expenses  all other factors being constant  if the market price of our common shares increases 
conversely  our liability will decrease and we may recognize significant non cash gains  all other factors being constant  if the market price of our common shares decreases 
we considered the historical volatility of our stock prices and determined that it was reasonably possible that the fair market value of our stock price could drastically increase in the near term but would have an immaterial impact to our consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations as there are only approximately  warrants outstanding
