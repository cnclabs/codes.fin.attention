item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in risk factors in part i  item a and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global provider of information technology it hardware  software and services solutions to businesses and public sector institutions in north america  europe  the middle east  africa emea and asia pacific apac 
currently  our offerings in north america and select countries in emea include it hardware  software and services 
our offerings in the remainder of our emea segment and in apac are almost entirely software and select software related services 
our vision is to be the trusted advisor to our clients  helping them enhance business performance through innovative technology solutions 
our strategy is to grow market share and profitability by delivering relevant product  service and solutions offerings to our clients on a scalable support and delivery platform 
overall  we believe that was a productive year for our business 
market conditions were softer as macro economic concerns globally led to lower capital spending for it products 
however  we executed well on our strategic initiatives in the environment  we improved the overall profitability of our sales  investing strategically in sales and services resources  successfully integrating two acquisitions  and essentially completing significant it systems integration projects in europe and north america 
at the same time  we kept a disciplined focus on our expenses 
on a consolidated basis  for the year ended december   our net sales remained flat at billion  as growth in the public sector and mid market were offset by lower spending by large enterprise clients 
our resulting gross profit increased by million  or  while gross margin increased basis points to 
selling and administrative expenses increased in compared to as we invested in our sales force globally 
we reported earnings from operations of million in  an improvement of compared to the prior year  which represented of net sales  consistent with the prior year 
our effective tax rate in was compared to in and in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were million and  respectively  for the year ended december  in  we reported net earnings of million and diluted net earnings per share of

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the results of operations for the year ended december  include the following items severance and restructuring expenses of million  million net of tax  and a tax benefit of million related to the recapitalization of one of our foreign subsidiaries 
net of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded 
effective february   we acquired inmac  a broad portfolio business to business hardware reseller based in frankfurt  germany and amsterdam  netherlands servicing clients in western europe 
we believe that this acquisition supports our strategic plan to expand hardware capabilities into key markets in our existing european footprint 
effective october   we acquired ensynch  a leading professional services firm with multiple microsoft gold competencies across the complete microsoft solution set  including cloud migration and management 
the acquisition of ensynch did not have a significant effect on results of operations in during  we generated million of cash flows from operations 
we utilized million to fund capital investments primarily associated with our it systems upgrades and the acquisition of inmac 
during the year  we made combined net repayments of million under our senior revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization financing facility  which were offset by million of net borrowings under our inventory financing facility 
we ended the year with million of cash and cash equivalents and million of debt outstanding under our long term facilities 
as we have previously disclosed  our largest software partner has informed its resellers  including the company  about changes to certain elements of its channel incentive program that have been impacting resellers since the program changes first became effective in late the changes affect our financial results over a three year period as our client contracts are renewed under the new program 
in addition  as additional details of the new programs are announced and differing aspects of the program changes are clarified  we are continually assessing the anticipated effect that these changes will have on our results of operations and financial position 
based on our known client contracts renewing in  program information currently available and certain mitigating actions  we expect the full year effect to be a reduction of gross profit of between to million  as compared to the amount we earned in details about segment results of operations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sales recognition sales are recognized when title and risk of loss are passed to the client  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard sales terms are fob shipping point or equivalent  at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client 
however  because we either i have a general practice of covering client losses while products are in transit despite title and risk of loss contractually transferring at the point of shipment or ii have specifically stated fob destination contractual terms with the client  delivery is not deemed to have occurred until the point in time when the product is received by the client 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates 
our manufacturers warrant most of the products we market  and it is our policy to request that clients return their defective products directly to the manufacturer for warranty service 
on selected products  and for selected client service reasons  we may accept returns directly from the client and then either credit the client or ship a replacement product 
we generally offer a limited to day return policy for unopened products and certain opened products  which are consistent with manufacturers terms  however  for some products we may charge restocking fees 
products returned opened are processed and returned to the manufacturer or partner for repair  replacement or credit to us 
we resell most unopened products returned to us 
products that cannot be returned to the manufacturer for warranty processing  but are in working condition  are sold to inventory liquidators  to end users as previously sold or used products  or through other channels to reduce our losses from returned products 
we record the freight we bill to our clients as net sales and the related freight costs we pay as costs of goods sold 
we report sales net of any sales based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with sales transactions 
revenue is recognized from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license  but in no case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met ie  evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
the sale of hardware and software products may also include the provision of services  and the associated contracts may contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
services that are performed by us in conjunction with hardware and software sales that are completed in our facilities prior to shipment of the product are recognized upon delivery  when title passes to the client  for the hardware sale 
net sales of services that are performed at client locations are often service only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed 
if the services are performed at a client location in conjunction with a hardware  software or other services sale  we recognize net sales for each portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to the items as they are delivered or the services are performed 
at the inception of the arrangement  the total consideration for the arrangement is allocated to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
we determine our best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the revenue allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the products 
we currently do not have any material instances in which we account for revenue from multiple element arrangements when vendor specific evidence does not exist 
if vendor specific objective evidence were not available  we would utilize third party evidence to allocate the selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence were available  estimated selling price would be used for allocation purposes 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software maintenance or subscription products for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and  thus  are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
we determine whether we act as a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply acting as an agent or broker 
under gross sales recognition  the selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales  resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction  and there are no costs of goods sold 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we recognize revenue for sales of services ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided if there is no discernible pattern of recognition of the cost to perform the service 
billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period 
revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a period of time without taking possession of software are also accounted for ratably over the time period over which the service will be provided 
we recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred as the services are performed and amounts are earned 
additionally  we sell certain professional services contracts on a fixed fee basis 
revenues for fixed fee professional services contracts are recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
net sales for these service contracts are not a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
partner funding we receive payments and credits from partners  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold 
partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold 
partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place only if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs 
consideration that exceeds the specific  incremental  identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold 
changes in estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs may materially affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
we primarily issue service based and performance based restricted stock units rsus 
the number of rsus ultimately awarded under performance based rsus varies based on whether we achieve certain financial results 
we record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
for any stock options awarded  modifications to previous awards or awards of rsus that are tied to specified market conditions  we use option pricing models or lattice binomial models to determine fair value of the awards 
the estimated fair value of stock options is determined on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on evaluation of the aging of the receivables  historical write offs and the current economic environment 
should our clients or vendors circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at expected margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our partners governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the price protection and stock rotation process  estimates are made regarding write downs of the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers publishers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment  our asset impairment review assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares that value to the carrying value 
such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
we perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  and that assessment requires a significant amount of judgment 
events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations 
any adverse change in these factors  among others  could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management of the segment regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
when two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics  the components may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if the segment comprises only a single component 
insight has three reporting units  which are equivalent to our operating segments 
we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
in completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill  we first compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value  including goodwill 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit  including the market and income approaches 
all of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment  or both 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the company  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units  we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
in step two of the analysis  we utilize the fair value of the reporting unit computed in the first step to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
management must also apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these individual assets and liabilities and may include independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets  such as trademarks 
management also evaluates the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair values of these individual assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
see further information on the carrying value of goodwill in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
income taxes our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then all or part of the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
any change in a valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions established in purchase accounting will generally affect income tax expense 
we establish liabilities for potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with uncertain tax positions taken on specific tax matters 
these liabilities are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in subsequent recognition or derecognition of a tax position based on all the available information at the time 
if material adjustments are warranted  it could affect our effective tax rate 
additional information about the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual 
an accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
additional information about contingencies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   and net sales costs of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and administrative expenses severance and restructuring expenses earnings from operations non operating expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings throughout this results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we refer to changes in net sales  gross profit and selling and administrative expenses in emea and apac excluding the effects of foreign currency movements 
in computing these change amounts and percentages  we compare the current year amount as translated into us dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior year amount in local currency translated into us dollars utilizing the average translation rate for the current year 
compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  remained flat at billion compared to the year ended december  our net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in thousands change north america emea apac consolidated net sales in north america decreased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales of software increased year over year  while net sales of hardware and services decreased and  respectively  year to year 
the software growth was primarily driven by new client wins and stable demand for business productivity software across the large  mid market and public sector client groups 
our public sector business in particular saw strong growth in in this category  gaining market share in the federal and state and local markets with new client wins 
hardware sales in the mid market increased year to year  but we experienced a decline in purchases by our large enterprise clients as we believe they rationalized investment dollars and the timing of projects 
hardware and services sales comparisons also reflect large client deployments in the prior year that concluded in the second half of and were not completely replaced in by new client engagements 
net sales in emea increased million or  in us dollars  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  net sales were up compared to the prior year 
net sales of hardware and services were up and  respectively  year over year  while net sales of software declined year to year 
excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  hardware  software and services increased  and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the growth in hardware was attributable to the acquisition of inmac  which contributed million in net sales during the year ended december   and low single digit organic growth 
the increase in software sales was due to higher sales of business productivity software products 
the increase in net sales of services was due primarily to higher volume and new client engagements

emea s gross profit increased in us dollars for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  gross profit was up compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased by approximately basis points year to year due primarily to a basis point decline in margin from agency fees for enterprise software agreements and a basis point decline in margin from services sales 
the decrease in agency fees was due to program changes from our largest software partner that became effective in the fourth quarter of and were only partially offset by net new agreements and higher renewals during these decreases in gross margin were offset partially by a basis point increase in product margin  which includes partner funding and freight  primarily driven by higher margin hardware sales associated with the acquisition of inmac in apac s gross profit increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased by approximately basis points  due primarily to higher partner funding and a higher mix of netted software sales  partially offset by a decrease in services margins and a decrease in agency fees from enterprise software agreements

the year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses is attributable to increases in salaries and benefits due to investments in headcount to support the roll out of our hardware sales capability in the netherlands and france and the acquisition of inmac in february apac s selling and administrative expenses increased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased basis points to of net sales for the year ended december  excluding the effects of foreign currency movements  selling and administrative expenses also increased compared to the prior year 
the year over year increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily driven by increases in salaries and benefits due to investments in headcount associated with specialty sales and professional services positions 
severance and restructuring expenses 
during the year ended december   north america and emea recorded severance expense  net of adjustments  totaling million and million  respectively  related to restructuring activities 
these charges were associated with severance costs for the elimination of certain positions based on a re alignment of roles and responsibilities 
in north america and emea  million and million  respectively  in new severance costs were offset by  and  respectively  of adjustments to prior severance accruals due to changes in estimates during during the year ended december   north america and emea recorded severance expense of million and million  respectively

non operating income expense 
interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the decrease in interest income year over year is primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and our capital lease obligation and imputed interest under our inventory financing facility 
interest expense declined for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to lower average borrowing rates and lower average daily debt balances year to year 
imputed interest under our inventory financing facility was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower average balances outstanding under the facility

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gain on bargain purchase 
our emea operating segment reported a non operating gain on bargain purchase of million in as the fair value of the inmac net assets we acquired exceeded the purchase price 
net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change in net foreign currency exchange gains losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates  mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain non functional currency assets and liabilities against changes in exchange rate movements 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  consists primarily of bank fees associated with our cash management activities 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate in was slightly higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state taxes in the us and to increases in the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by lower taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate in was less than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the reorganization of certain of our foreign operations during the fourth quarter that resulted in the recognition of foreign tax credits

net foreign currency exchange gains losses 
these gains losses result from foreign currency transactions  including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the change in net foreign currency exchange gains losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates  mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain non functional currency assets and liabilities against changes in exchange rate movements

the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect the effect of a single significant sale transacted with a public sector client late in december the decrease in inventories in was primarily a result of inventory management initiatives undertaken in our north america segment  and the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in was primarily due to the relative timing of vat and sales tax payments year over year 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  reflect our net earnings  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and write offs and write downs of assets  as well as changes in accounts receivable  other current assets  other assets  accounts payable and deferred revenue 
the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect increased sales and associated costs of goods sold  respectively  in compared to the decreases in other current assets and deferred revenue in were primarily due to a large project for which we deferred revenue recognition and the related costs as of december  until we received client acceptance during of the work performed 
the increase in other assets in was primarily due to an increase in multi year contracts resulting in increased long term accounts receivable and deferred costs compared to the prior year 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  reflect our net earnings  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  deferred income taxes and write downs of inventories 
also contributing to the cash flows from operating activities in were increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts payable reflects increased costs of goods sold associated with the increase in net sales in compared to these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable in also reflects increased net sales compared to the increase in inventories in was primarily attributable to client specific inventory purchased in north america late in as a result of new client engagements and overall higher demand for hardware 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in was primarily due to payments made to settle certain state unclaimed property liabilities and to reduce income taxes payable

average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two 
daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by days

daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by days 
d calculated as dsos plus days inventory outstanding  less dpos 
our cash conversion cycle was days in the fourth quarter ended december   up two days from the fourth quarter of  due primarily to higher accounts receivable in north america  despite lower sales recorded during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the year over year increases in both dsos and dpos reflect the effect of a single significant sale transacted with a public sector client late in december 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our cash conversion cycle was days in the fourth quarter ended december   up four days from the fourth quarter of due to increases in dso period to period  primarily in our foreign operations  and due to a higher mix of transactions booked late in the fourth quarter 
our cash conversion cycle was days in the fourth quarter ended december   decreasing five days from days in the fourth quarter ended december  these results were primarily due to the expanded use of our inventory financing facility  which contributed to an increase in dpos during the fourth quarter of of six days  partially offset by an increase in days inventory outstanding resulting from increased investment in inventory to support specific client engagements 
we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts 
we intend to use cash generated in in excess of working capital needs to pay down our outstanding debt balances  repurchase shares of our common stock and support our capital expenditures for the year

as of december   the current portion of our long term debt relates solely to our capital lease obligation 
our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives 
while the abs facility has a stated maximum amount  the actual availability under the abs facility is limited by the quantity and quality of the underlying accounts receivable 
as of december   qualified receivables were sufficient to permit access to the full million  of which million was outstanding at december  our consolidated debt balance that can be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter under our revolving facility and our abs facility is limited by certain financial covenants  particularly a maximum leverage ratio 
the maximum leverage ratio is calculated as aggregate debt outstanding divided by the sum of the company s trailing twelve month net earnings loss plus i interest expense  excluding non cash imputed interest on our inventory financing facility  ii income tax expense benefit  iii depreciation and amortization and iv non cash stock based compensation adjusted earnings 
the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the agreements is times trailing twelve month adjusted earnings 
we anticipate that we will be in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio requirements over the next four quarters 
however  a significant drop in the company s adjusted earnings would limit the amount of indebtedness that could be outstanding at the end of any fiscal quarter to a level that would be below the company s consolidated maximum debt capacity 
based on the company s maximum leverage ratio as of december   the company s debt balance that could have been outstanding under our revolving facility and our abs facility was reduced from the maximum borrowing capacity of million to million  of which million was outstanding at december

certain of these cash balances could and will be remitted to the us by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business

the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or some combination of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients
