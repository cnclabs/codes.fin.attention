overview we offer automobile dealers financing programs that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history 
our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing  from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers  and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our product  but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing 
for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the same period in and million  or per diluted share  for the same period in the growth in and consolidated net income was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of our loan portfolio 
critical success factors critical success factors include our ability to access capital on acceptable terms  accurately forecast consumer loan performance  and maintain or grow consumer loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate  with an objective to maximize economic profit 
economic profit is a financial metric we use to evaluate our financial results and determine incentive compensation 
economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital  both debt and equity  and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business 
access to capital our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to maintain consistent financial performance  maintain modest financial leverage  and maintain multiple funding sources 
our funded debt to equity ratio is as of december  we currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing a revolving secured line of credit  warehouse facilities  term abs financings  and senior notes 
consumer loan performance at the time a consumer loan is submitted to us for assignment  we forecast future expected cash flows from the consumer loan 
based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels  an advance or one time purchase payment is made to the related dealer at a price designed to achieve an acceptable return on capital 
if consumer loan performance equals or exceeds our initial expectation  it is likely our target return on capital will be achieved 

table of contents we use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each consumer loan at the time of assignment 
we continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each consumer loan subsequent to assignment 
our evaluation becomes more accurate as the consumer loans age  as we use actual performance data in our forecast 
by comparing our current expected collection rate for each consumer loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment  we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast 
the following table compares our forecast of consumer loan collection rates as of december   with the forecasts as of december   as of december   and at the time of assignment  segmented by year of assignment forecasted collection percentage as of variance in forecasted collection percentage from consumer loan assignment year december  december  december  initial forecast december  december  initial forecast consumer loans assigned in and through have yielded forecasted collection results materially better than our initial estimates  while consumer loans assigned in and have yielded forecasted collection results materially worse than our initial estimates 
for all other assignment years presented  actual results have been very close to our initial estimates 
for the year ended december   forecasted collection rates improved for consumer loans assigned during and through and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented 
forecasting collection rates precisely at loan inception is difficult 
with this in mind  we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  even if collection rates are less than we currently forecast 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of december  all amounts  unless otherwise noted  are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
the table includes both dealer loans and purchased loans 
as of december  consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread of forecast realized represents advances paid to dealers on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealers to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections 

table of contents the risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the consumer loans age 
for and prior consumer loan assignments  the risk of a material forecast variance is modest  as we have currently realized in excess of of the expected collections 
conversely  the forecasted collection rates for more recent consumer loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized 
the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate declined during the through period as we increased advance rates during this period in response to a more difficult competitive environment 
during and  the spread increased as the competitive environment improved and we reduced advance rates 
in addition  during  the spread was positively impacted by better than expected consumer loan performance 
during the through period  the spread decreased as we again increased advance rates in response to the competitive environment 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  and the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate as of december  for dealer loans and purchased loans separately 
all amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread dealer loans purchased loans represents advances paid to dealers on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealers to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
the advance rates presented for each consumer loan assignment year change over time due to the impact of transfers between dealer and purchased loans 
under our portfolio program  certain events may result in dealers forfeiting their rights to dealer holdback 
we transfer the dealer s consumer loans from the dealer loan portfolio to the purchased loan portfolio in the period this forfeiture occurs 
although the advance rate on purchased loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on dealer loans  purchased loans do not require us to pay dealer holdback 
consumer loan volume the following table summarizes changes in consumer loan assignment volume in each of the last three years as compared to the same period in the previous year year over year percent change for the year ended december  unit volume dollar volume represents advances paid to dealers on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealers to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
consumer loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including the overall demand for our product  the amount of capital available to fund new loans  and our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support 
our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate  within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints 

table of contents unit and dollar volumes grew and  respectively  during as the number of active dealers grew and average volume per active dealer declined 
we believe the decline in volume per dealer is the result of increased competition 
we increased advance rates throughout  and  which positively impacted unit and dollar volumes while reducing the return on capital we expect to earn on new assignments 
we believe these advance rate increases had a positive impact on economic profit as we believe the positive impact of the increased dollar volume exceeded the negative impact of the reduced return on capital 
the following table summarizes the changes in consumer loan unit volume and active dealers for the years ended december  change to to consumer loan unit volume active dealers average volume per active dealer active dealers are dealers who have received funding for at least one loan during the period 
the following table provides additional information on the changes in consumer loan unit volume and active dealers for the years ended december  for the years ended december  change change consumer loan unit volume from dealers active both periods dealers active both periods average volume per dealers active both periods consumer loan unit volume from new dealers new active dealers average volume per new active dealers attrition new active dealers are dealers who enrolled in our program and have received funding for their first loan from us during the period 
attrition is measured according to the following formula decrease in consumer loan unit volume from dealers who have received funding for at least one loan during the comparable period of the prior year but did not receive funding for any loans during the current period divided by prior year comparable period consumer loan unit volume 
consumer loans are assigned to us as either dealer loans through our portfolio program or purchased loans through our purchase program 
the following table summarizes the portion of our consumer loan volume that was assigned to us as dealer loans for the years ended december  dealer loan unit volume as a percentage of total unit volume dealer loan dollar volume as a percentage of total dollar volume represents advances paid to dealers on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealers to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
for the year ended december   dealer loan unit and dollar volume as a percentage of total unit and dollar volume were generally consistent with the same periods in and as of december  and  the net dealer loans receivable balance was and  respectively  of the total net loans receivable balance

the average yield on our loan portfolio for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the same period in due to lower yields on new loans  partially offset by improvements in forecasted collection rates throughout and premiums earned 
for the year ended december   premiums earned increased million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio which resulted from growth in new consumer loan assignments throughout and other income 
for the year ended december   other income decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease in other income was primarily the result of the following a million decrease in gap profit sharing income  which was a result of the following additional income recognized during as a result of a change we made to our revenue recognition during to begin recognizing this income as earned over the life of the gap contracts 
a change made to our profit sharing income arrangement during that increased the total amount of income earned per gap contract but reduced the amount recognized as other income 
this reduction was more than offset by a higher fee per gap contract that is recognized as finance charges 
a million increase in gps sid fee income due to increases in both the fee earned per unit and the number of units purchased by dealers from tppps

for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses decreased million  or  as compared to under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  when the present value of forecasted future cash flows decline relative to our expectations at the time of assignment  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
for purposes of calculating the required allowance  dealer loans are grouped by dealer and purchased loans are grouped by month of purchase 
as a result  regardless of the overall performance of the portfolio of consumer loans  a provision can be required if any individual loan pool performs worse than expected 
conversely  a previously recorded provision can be reversed if any previously impaired individual loan pool experiences an improvement in performance 
during the year ended december   overall consumer loan performance exceeded our expectations at the start of the year 
however  the performance of certain loan pools declined from our expectations during the year  resulting in a provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december   of which million related to dealer loans partially offset by a reversal of provision of million related to purchased loans

for the year ended december   other income increased million  or  as compared to the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in gap profit sharing income and dealer enrollment fees 
the increase in gap profit sharing income of million was the result of an increase in the annual profit sharing payment received and recognized during the first quarter of and an acceleration in our revenue recognition for this income beginning in the second quarter of under our arrangement with one of our tppps  we receive annual profit sharing payments based on the performance of our gap program 
prior to the second quarter of  we received and recognized gap profit sharing payments annually in the first quarter of each year 
during the second quarter of  we began recognizing this income over the life of the gap contracts 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by million of income recognized during related to discontinued arrangements with a tppp and a vendor that processes payments 
we have not recognized any income related to these arrangements since the second quarter of operating expenses

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment  and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
finance charge revenue allowance for credit losses balance sheet captions loans receivable allowance for credit losses income statement captions finance charges provision for credit losses nature of estimates required estimating the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments 
assumptions and approaches used for accounting purposes  we are not considered to be an originator of consumer loans  but instead are considered to be a lender to our dealers for consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program  and a purchaser of consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
as a result of this classification  our accounting policies for recognizing finance charge revenue and determining our allowance for credit losses may be different from other lenders in our market  who  based on their different business models  may be considered to be a direct lender to consumers for accounting purposes 
for additional information regarding our classification as a lender to our dealers for accounting purposes  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents we recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
for dealer loans  finance charge revenue and the allowance for credit losses are calculated after first aggregating dealer loans outstanding for each dealer 
for the same purpose  purchased loans are aggregated according to the month the loan was purchased 
an allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net asset value loan balance less the allowance to the value of forecasted future cash flows discounted at the yield established at the time of assignment 
the discounted value of future cash flows is comprised of estimated future collections on the loans  less any estimated dealer holdback payments related to dealer loans 
we write off loans once there are no forecasted future collections on any of the associated consumer loans 
actual cash flows from any individual dealer loan or pool of purchased loans are often different than estimated cash flows at the time of assignment 
if such difference is favorable  the difference is recognized prospectively into income over the remaining life of the dealer loan or pool of purchased loans through a yield adjustment 
if such difference is unfavorable  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
because differences between estimated cash flows at the time of assignment and actual cash flows occur often  an allowance is required for a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
an allowance for credit losses does not necessarily indicate that a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans is unprofitable  and in recent years  very seldom are cash flows from a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans insufficient to repay the initial amounts advanced or paid to the dealer 
future collections on dealer and purchased loans are forecasted based on the historical performance of consumer loans with similar characteristics  adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns 
dealer holdback is forecasted based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each dealer loan 
during the fourth quarter of  we enhanced the computations used to account for dealer loans 
the enhanced computations utilize a more sophisticated approach for determining the yields established at the time of assignment  future net cash flow streams and the present value of future cash flow streams 
while the enhanced computations did not change these estimates significantly at the overall dealer loan portfolio level  we believe they improved the precision of these estimates at the individual dealer level 
implementation of the enhanced computations reduced net income by million 
key factors variances in the amount and timing of future net cash flows from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods 
a decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on loans as of december  would have reduced net income by approximately million 

table of contents premiums earned balance sheet caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities income statement caption premiums earned nature of estimates required estimating the pattern of future claims on vehicle service contracts 
assumptions and approaches used premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience 
in developing our cost expectations  we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term  as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past 
we will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate  including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence  and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified 
key factors variances in the pattern of future claims from our current estimates would impact the timing of premiums recognized in future periods 
a change in premiums earned for the year ended december  would have affected net income by approximately million 
stock based compensation expense balance sheet caption paid in capital income statement caption salaries and wages nature of estimates required stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date the equity instrument is granted or awarded by us  and is recognized over the expected vesting period of the equity instrument 
we also estimate expected forfeiture rates of restricted stock awards 
assumptions and approaches used in recognizing restricted stock based compensation expense  we make assumptions regarding the expected forfeiture rates of the restricted stock awards 
we also make assumptions regarding the expected vesting dates of performance based restricted stock awards 
the fair value of restricted stock awards are estimated as if they were vested and issued on the grant date and are recognized over the expected vesting period of the restricted stock award 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which are incorporated herein by reference

table of contents uncertain tax positions balance sheet captions income taxes receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities income statement caption provision for income taxes nature of estimates required estimating the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return 
assumptions and approaches used we follow a two step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions 
first  we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  for positions that we determine are more likely than not to be sustained  we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being sustained 
we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions liability that is comprised of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 
we adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or more information becomes available 
on june   we reached a settlement with the irs which concluded the examination of our federal income tax returns for through and closed the respective years 
as a result of the settlement  we agreed to pay a total of million in federal and state taxes and interest related to these years 
the settlement includes million of taxes that represent an acceleration of taxes already provided for in prior periods and the payment did not have an impact on our net income during the reporting periods 
we also concluded that all through uncertain federal jurisdiction tax positions taken in previous periods are effectively settled and we recorded a reversal of corresponding accrued reserves and interest 
this reversal increased net income by million 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
key factors to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in future periods could be materially affected
