operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue from the company s fuel surcharge program 
that program is designed to reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by adjusting total freight charges to account for changes in the price of fuel 
the company s fuel surcharge is generally based on the average national price for diesel fuel and is reset weekly 
fuel surcharges have remained in effect for several years  are widely accepted in the industry and are a significant component of revenue and pricing 
fuel surcharges are an integral part of annual customer contract renewals which blur the distinction between base price increases and recoveries under the fuel surcharge program 
fuel surcharges represent only one portion of overall competitive price negotiations as customers may negotiate increases in base rates instead of increases in fuel surcharges or vice versa 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  operating expenses and margin consolidated operating income was million in compared to operating income of million in overall  the operations were favorably impacted in by higher yield combined with continued cost optimization initiatives throughout our network

outlook our business remains highly correlated to the general economy and competitive pricing pressures  as well as the success of company specific improvement initiatives 
while improved through and  there remains uncertainty as to the timing and strength of economic recovery 
we are continuing initiatives to increase yield  to reduce costs and improve productivity 
we focus on providing top quality service and improving safety performance 
if significant competitors were to cease operations and their capacity leave the market  current industry excess capacity conditions would likely improve 
however  there can be no assurance that any industry consolidation will indeed happen or if such consolidation occurs that it will materially improve the excess industry capacity 
the company continues to pursue revenue and cost initiatives to improve profitability 
planned revenue initiatives include  but are not limited to  building density in our current geography  targeted marketing initiatives to grow revenue in more profitable segments  as well as pricing and yield management 
on july   saia implemented a percent general rate increase for customers comprising approximately percent of saia s operating revenue 
the extent of success of these revenue initiatives is impacted by what proves to be the underlying economic trends  competitor initiatives and other factors discussed under forward looking statements and part ii  item a 
risk factors 
in  the company implemented certain cost reduction measures including the suspension of the company s k match  effective reduction in compensation equal to ten percent of salary for the company s leadership team and a five percent wage and salary reduction for hourly  linehaul and salaried employees in operations  maintenance and administration  and a ten percent reduction in the annual retainer and meeting fees paid to the non employee members of the company s board of directors 
despite these necessary reductions  the company s compensation philosophy remained committed to a market based program 
based on the continued improvement in the company s operating results and the company s desire to attract and retain employees needed for the company to continue to deliver best in class service to customers  management began taking steps in april to reinstate some or all of certain compensation programs and amounts subject to the reductions 
one half of the k match suspension was reinstated effective april  the company 
table of contents implemented a two and one half percent wage and salary increase for hourly  linehaul and salaried employees in operations  maintenance  administration and management effective december  effective july   the company implemented a salary and wage increase for all its employees of approximately three percent 
the impact of the july compensation increase is expected to be approximately million annually 
also effective july   the company increased board of director s compensation to market levels 
the company anticipates the impact of the july compensation increase to be partially offset by further productivity and efficiency gains 
if the company builds market share  there are numerous operating leverage cost benefits 
conversely  should the economy soften from present levels  the company plans to attempt to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage 
the success of cost improvement initiatives is also impacted by the cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation  fuel  insurance claims  regulatory changes  successful implementation of profit improvement initiatives and other factors discussed under forward looking statements and part ii  item a

table of contents the company has unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million and accrued interest and penalties of million related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of december  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlement with respective taxing authorities beyond one year and accordingly has not included the amounts within the above contractual cash obligation and other commercial commitment tables 
the company sold the stock of jevic transportation  inc jevic on june  and remains a guarantor under indemnity agreements  primarily with certain insurance underwriters with respect to jevic s self insured retention sir obligation for workers compensation  bodily injury and property damage and general liability claims against jevic arising out of occurrences prior to the transaction date 
in september  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the debtors of jevic  which was approved by the bankruptcy court  under which the company assumed jevic s sir obligation on the workers compensation  bodily injury and property damage  and general liability claims arising prior to the transaction date 
in addition  the settlement agreement included a mutual release of claims  except for the company s responsibility to jevic for certain outstanding tax liabilities in the states of new york and new jersey for the periods prior to the transaction date and for any potential fraudulent conveyance claims 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company include claims and insurance accruals 
the company has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to million per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by the company are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis with respect to workers compensation claims  demographics  nature and severity  and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of the company differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectability 
revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pickup and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the company s accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for the company s 
table of contents revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
these accounting policies and others are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of interest rates and fuel prices 
the detail of the company s debt structure is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this form k for the year ended december  to help mitigate our risk to rising fuel prices  the company has implemented a fuel surcharge program 
this program is well established within the industry and customer acceptance of fuel surcharges remains high 
since the amount of fuel surcharge is based on average national fuel prices and is reset weekly  exposure of the company to fuel price volatility is significantly reduced 
however  the fuel surcharge may not fully offset fuel price fluctuations during periods of rapid increases or decreases in the price of fuel and is also subject to overall competitive pricing negotiations 
the following table provides information about the company s third party financial instruments as of december  with comparative information for december  the table presents principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
the fair value of the fixed rate debt in millions was estimated based upon level two in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of these senior notes is based on undiscounted cash flows at market interest rates for similar issuances of private debt
