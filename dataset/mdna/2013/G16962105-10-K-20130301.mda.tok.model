item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results bunge limited  a bermuda company  together with its subsidiaries  is a leading global agribusiness and food company operating in the farm to consumer food chain 
the commodity nature of the company principal products  as well as regional and global supply and demand variations that occur as an inherent part of the business  make volumes an important operating measure 
accordingly  volume information is included in the table that summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment 
the unit of measure for all reported volumes is metric tons  a common unit of measure within our industry 
a description of reported volumes for each reportable segment has also been included in the discussion of key factors affecting results of operations in each of our business segments as discussed below 
agribusiness in the agribusiness segment  we purchase  store  transport  process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and processed commodity products and the availability and costs of energy  transportation and logistics services 
profitability in our oilseed processing operations is also impacted by volumes procured  processed and sold and by capacity utilization rates 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by many factors  including weather  farmer planting decisions  plant disease  governmental policies and agricultural sector economic conditions 
reported volumes in this segment primarily reflect grains and oilseeds originated from farmers  cooperatives or other aggregators and from which origination margins are earned  oilseeds processed in our oilseed processing facilities and from which crushing margins are earned representing the margin resulting from the industrial separation of the oilseed into its protein meal and vegetable oil components  both of which components are separate commodity products themselves  and third party sales of grains  oilseeds and related commodity products merchandised through our distribution businesses and from which distribution margins are earned 
the foregoing sub segment volumes may overlap as they produce separate margin capture opportunities 
for example  oilseeds procured in our south american grain origination activities may be processed in our oilseed processing facilities in asia and will be reflected at both points within the segment 
as such  these reported volumes do not represent solely volumes of net sales to third parties  but rather where margin is earned  appropriately reflecting their contribution to our global network capacity utilization and profitability 
demand for our purchased and processed agribusiness products is affected by many factors  including global and regional economic conditions  changes in per capita incomes  the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  particularly pork and poultry  population growth rates  relative prices of substitute agricultural products  outbreaks of disease associated with livestock and poultry  and demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products 
we expect that the factors described above will continue to affect global supply and demand for our agribusiness products for the foreseeable future 
we also expect that  from time to time  imbalances will likely exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain regions  which impacts our decisions regarding whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport  process 
table of contents or sell these commodities  including whether to change the location of or adjust our own oilseed processing capacity 
sugar and bioenergy our sugar and bioenergy segment is an integrated business which includes the procurement and growing of sugarcane and the production of sugar  ethanol and electricity in our eight mills in brazil  five of which were acquired in february in the moema acquisition  global sugar trading and merchandising activities and minority interests in us corn based ethanol producers 
profitability in this segment is affected by the availability and quality of sugarcane  which impact our capacity utilization rates and the amount of sugar that can be extracted from the sugarcane  and by market prices of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol 
availability and quality of sugarcane is affected by many factors  including weather  geographical factors such as soil quality and topography  and agricultural practices 
once planted  sugarcane may be harvested for several continuous years  but the usable crop decreases with each subsequent harvest 
as a result  the current optimum economic cycle is generally five or six consecutive harvests  depending on location 
we own and or have partnership agreements to manage farmland on which we grow and harvest sugarcane 
we also purchase sugarcane from third parties 
prices of sugarcane in brazil are established by consecana  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council  and are based on the sucrose content of the cane and the market prices of sugar and ethanol 
demand for our products is affected by such factors as changes in global or regional economic conditions  the financial condition of customers and customer access to credit  worldwide consumption of food products  population growth rates  changes in per capita incomes and demand for and governmental support of renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities  including sugarcane 
we expect that these factors will continue to affect supply and demand for our sugar and bioenergy products in the foreseeable future 
reported volumes in this segment reflect third party sales of sugar and ethanol 
food and ingredients in the food and ingredients division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operating results are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products that we sell  changes in consumer eating habits  changes in per capita incomes  consumer purchasing power levels  availability of credit to customers  governmental dietary guidelines and policies  changes in regional economic conditions and the general competitive environment in our markets 
raw material inputs to our production processes in the edible oil products segment and the milling products segment are largely sourced at market prices from our agribusiness segment 
reported volumes in these segments reflect third party sales of our finished products and  as such  include the sales of products derived from raw materials sourced from the agribusiness segment as well as from third parties 
the unit of measure for these volumes is metric tons as these businesses are linked to the commodity raw materials which are their primary inputs 
fertilizer in the fertilizer segment  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the agricultural sectors we serve  the availability of credit to farmers  agricultural commodity prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvests 
our profitability is impacted by international selling prices for fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials  such as phosphate  sulfur  ammonia and urea  ocean freight rates and other import costs as well as import volumes at the port facilities we manage in brazil 
as our operations are in south america  primarily argentina  our results in this segment are typically seasonal  with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to 
table of contents the timing of the south american agricultural cycle 
reported volumes in this segment reflect third party sales of our finished products 
in addition to these industry related factors which impact our business divisions  our results of operations in all business divisions and segments are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements and foreign currency transactions can affect our results 
on a monthly basis  for subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency  subsidiary statements of income and cash flows must be translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes based on weighted average exchange rates in each monthly period 
as a result  fluctuations of local currencies compared to the us dollar during each monthly period impact our consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each reported period quarter and year to date and also affect comparisons between those reported periods 
subsidiary balance sheets are translated using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustments reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
included in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended december   and were foreign exchange net translation gains losses of million   million and million  respectively  resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
additionally  we record transaction gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity 
these amounts are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates as of the balance sheet date  with the resulting gains or losses included in the entity statement of income and  therefore  in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain loss 
we primarily use a combination of equity and intercompany loans to finance our subsidiaries 
intercompany loans that are of a long term investment nature with no intention of repayment in the foreseeable future are considered permanently invested and as such are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  any foreign exchange translation gains or losses on such permanently invested intercompany loans are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
in contrast  foreign exchange translation gains or losses on intercompany loans that are not of a permanent nature are recorded in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains losses 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes on income in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from to 
the jurisdictions that most significantly impact our effective tax rate are brazil  the united states and argentina 
determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events 
results of operations overview net income attributable to bunge for was million compared to million for net income for includes an after tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the sugar and bioenergy segment and an after tax loss of million associated with discontinued fertilizer 
table of contents operations that are being sold including a million valuation allowance for certain tax assets that were no longer expected to be recoverable as a result of the sale of the brazilian fertilizer business 
in addition  net income attributable to bunge in included a million after tax gain in our agribusiness segment from the sale of our investment in the solae company to our joint venture partner for million in cash exclusive of a special cash dividend of million  an after tax gain of million from the acquisition in our milling product segment of a controlling interest in a joint venture  and an after tax impairment charge of million associated with three equity investments and two affiliate loans to joint ventures in our sugar and bioenergy and agribusiness segments total segment ebit of million declined from  million in  and includes the pre tax impacts of the items noted above million from the impairment of goodwill in the sugar and bioenergy segment  million from the sale of our interest in the solae company  million of gains from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a north american wheat milling business  and million from the impairment of three equity investments and two affiliate loans to joint ventures in agribusiness segment ebit increased driven by improved oilseed processing results in north and south america as well as strong grain merchandising results in europe  middle east and africa emea 
volumes in the segment increased  reflecting improved crop availability in eastern europe  the impact of the expansion of our grain origination network in north america  the impact of our expanded port operations in north america and ukraine and the full year results of the expansion of our oilseed processing operations in asia 
we also recognized a gain of million on the sale of our interest in solae 
in addition  a loss of million was recorded on the sale of million of recoverable tax assets in brazil and impairment charges of million were recorded related to the write down of two equity investments in european biodiesel joint ventures and a loan to one of the ventures 
sugar and bioenergy segment ebit declined to million compared to million in included in segment ebit is a goodwill impairment charge of million as well as impairment charges of million related to the write down of an equity investment in a north american corn ethanol joint venture and a loan to the joint venture 
weaker results in our industrial operations were primarily the result of the impact of adverse weather on sugarcane yields and total recoverable sugar atr and lower sugar and ethanol prices in brazil  which reduced our margins 
these factors more than offset improvements in our trading and merchandising business 
in the food and ingredients division  edible oil products segment ebit decreased to million in from million in driven by weaker margins in north america  million of value added tax reserves in brazil and million of impairment charges related to the closure of a european margarine plant 
results were also impacted by higher advertising expenses and challenges associated with an sap implementation in brazil 
milling products segment ebit increased to million from million in primarily as a result of a million gain on the acquisition of a controlling interest in a north american wheat milling business 
this gain more than offset lower volumes and results in our wheat milling operations in brazil which were impacted by challenges associated with the sap implementation in the first half of fertilizer segment ebit decreased to million in compared to million in driven by lower results in our moroccan joint venture and our brazilian port operations 
our argentine business continued to perform well 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with yara international asa yara under which yara will acquire bunge brazilian fertilizer business  including blending facilities  brands and warehouses for million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments 
the transaction is expected to close in the second half of additionally  on december   we sold our interest in our north american fertilizer distribution joint venture to our partner  growmark  inc and exited this business 
as a result of these transactions  the results of these operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents segment results beginning in the first quarter of  management responsibilities for certain brazilian port facilities were moved from the agribusiness segment to the fertilizer segment 
accordingly  amounts presented for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period segment presentation 
bunge has five reportable segments agribusiness  sugar and bioenergy  edible oil products  milling products and fertilizer which are organized based upon similar economic characteristics and are similar in nature of products and services offered  the nature of production processes  the type and class of customer and distribution methods 
the agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin 
the sugar and bioenergy segment involves sugarcane growing and milling in brazil  sugar and ethanol trading and merchandising in various countries  as well as sugarcane based ethanol production and corn based ethanol investments and related activities 
the edible oil products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils 
the milling products segment involves the manufacturing and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn 
following the completion of the sale of bunge brazilian fertilizer nutrients assets in may see note and the classification of the brazilian fertilizer distribution and north american fertilizer businesses as discontinued operations see note  the activities of the fertilizer segment include its port operations in brazil and its operations in argentina 
additionally  bunge has retained its interest in its fertilizer joint venture in morocco 
a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below 
year ended december  us in millions volume in thousands of metric tons agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer net sales agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer total cost of goods sold agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer total

table of contents year ended december  us in millions segment earnings before interest and tax agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer other total depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness sugar and bioenergy edible oil products milling products fertilizer total net income attributable to bunge total segment earnings before interest and tax ebit is an operating performance measure used by bunge management to evaluate its segments operating activities 
total segment ebit is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace net income attributable to bunge  the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
bunge management believes segment ebit is a useful measure of its segments operating profitability  since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure 
in addition  ebit is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in bunge industries 
total segment ebit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to bunge or any other measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap 
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to net income attributable to bunge follows year ended december  us in millions total segment earnings from continuing operations before interest and tax interest income interest expense income tax expense benefit income from discontinued operations noncontrolling interests share of interest and tax net income attributable to bunge compared to agribusiness segment agribusiness segment net sales increased billion compared to volume increases  primarily in europe and the middle east  represented approximately billion of the increase with the remaining billion of the increase from higher average commodity selling prices  largely related to product mix 
higher volumes in europe in related primarily to very weak volumes in the first half of particularly the first half of the year as a result of a severe drought in eastern europe in the last half of that significantly reduced grain availability in the region through early strong merchandising demand  particularly in emea  also increased our volumes  as did our recent expansions  including additional origination capacity to support our export terminal in 
table of contents the us pacific northwest and our ukraine port facility as well as additional oilseed processing capacity in asia 
cost of goods sold increased billion over primarily due to the higher volumes mentioned above and  to a lesser extent  slightly higher commodity prices 
cost of goods sold was also favorably impacted by the effect of the weaker average brazilian real on functional currency costs when translated to us dollars 
cost of goods sold for also includes a charge of million related to certain value added taxes in brazil 
gross profit increased to billion from billion in driven by improved oilseed processing margins in south america as a result of strong export demand due to the drought reduced us grain harvests and in grain merchandising in emea which also benefited from strong regional demand and strong oilseed processing margins in north america 
these margin increases were partially offset by the million provision related to value added taxes in cost of goods sold 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in and driven by million of credit related expenses  primarily in brazil and europe  expansions in the us and asia and higher employee related costs  primarily in south america 
foreign exchange gains were million in compared to losses of million in  related primarily to the volatility of most global currencies relative to the us dollar during both periods 
foreign exchange results in both and were partially offset by inventory mark to market impacts included in cost of goods sold 
gain on sale of investments in affiliates of million was the result of the sale of our investment in solae  a north american soy ingredients joint venture  to our joint venture partner 
gain on sale of investments in affiliates of million in resulted from the sale of our interest in a european oilseed processing joint venture 
noncontrolling interests were million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interests share of income at our non wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily our oilseed processing operations in china 
other income expense for was expense of million compared to expense of million in included in this line item were a charge of million in resulting from the sale of certain recoverable tax assets in brazil at a discount and an impairment charge of million related to two equity method investments in european biodiesel producers 
agribusiness segment ebit increased as a result of the combination of factors discussed above 
sugar and bioenergy segment sugar and bioenergy segment net sales decreased billion from lower selling prices for sugar and ethanol in both our trading and merchandising and industrial operations resulted in a reduction in net sales of billion 
increased volumes related primarily to higher sales volumes of sugar and ethanol in our industrial business in  which increased net sales by billion when compared with cost of goods sold decreased billion primarily due to the impact of lower global sugar prices on our trading and merchandising business and on purchases of sugarcane in our industrial business 
these price related decreases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by the impact of slightly higher industrial volumes in gross profit decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the impact of lower sugar and ethanol selling prices on our industrial business 
these decreases were partially offset by improved merchandising margins resulting from strong demand  particularly in the middle east 
slightly higher volumes in our industrial operations also increased gross profit  but the 
table of contents benefit of the higher industrial volumes on fixed cost absorption could not be fully realized as a result of lower sugar content in the sugarcane that we processed 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to a charge of million due to write down of a loan to our north american corn ethanol joint venture 
sg a expenses in included approximately million of acquisition related expenses and million of restructuring charges 
foreign exchange losses were million in compared to losses of million in driven by the impact of continued volatility of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar 
a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing all of the segment goodwill assets  was recorded in the fourth quarter of upon completion of our annual impairment analysis 
this analysis applies equal weighting to comparable market multiples the market approach and discounted cash flow projections the income approach to determine a range of values for the fair value of the reporting unit 
all of the goodwill in our sugar business has been assigned at the segment level 
the income approach estimates fair value by discounting the segment estimated future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the business and includes  among other things  making assumptions about variables such as sugar and ethanol prices  future profitability  future capital expenditures and discount rates that might be used by a market participant 
all of these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment 
compared to there was a significant decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit primarily due to lower current trading multiples of comparable companies in the industry  a lack of market transactions to provide independent insight into the market perception of the current value of sugar milling operations and declines in global prices for both sugar and ethanol 
based on a detailed review of the results of these valuation approaches  it was determined that there were indicators of a potential impairment of the goodwill and further analysis was done to evaluate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the segment as of the october  testing date 
this allocation of the fair value included higher replacement values of our sugarcane mills compared to  increased value allocated to sugarcane plantations and increased values of transportation and mechanization equipment related to sugarcane planting and harvesting 
upon completion of the analysis  of the goodwill was determined to be impaired and a related charge was recorded within the segment 
this non cash charge does not have any impact on current or future cash flows or the performance of the underlying business 
noncontrolling interests were million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interests share of period income loss at our non wholly owned brazilian sugarcane mills 
in  million of the noncontrolling interests share of period loss was attributable to the noncontrolling interests share of the goodwill impairment 
other income expense for was a net expense of million compared to income of million in impairment charges of million were recorded in associated with the write down of an investment in a north american corn ethanol joint venture 
segment ebit decreased by million to a loss of million in from a loss of million in primarily as a result of the non cash impairment charges for goodwill and an equity method investment and related loan as well as the unfavorable impact of lower sugar and ethanol prices and of higher unit costs due to lower sugarcane yields and atr  on gross profit 
edible oil products segment net sales increased million from as the impact of higher sales volumes which increased of approximately million was partially offset by the impact of lower average selling prices which decreased of approximately million 
volumes increased primarily in asia resulting from the expansion of our operations in china and our amrit acquisition in india  volumes also increased in europe 

table of contents cost of goods sold increased as a result of the increased volumes in  partially offset by a decline in average raw material costs 
cost of goods sold in includes charges of million related to certain value added taxes in brazil  impairment charges of million related to the write down of a european refining facility and certain inventory adjustments in the us gross profit of million in declined when compared to gross profit of million in due primarily to the impact of the value added tax charge in brazil and the write down of the european refining facility 
sg a increased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to increased expenses and costs associated with the implementation of sap in brazil as well as the impact of acquisitions in india and north america 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of the weaker average brazilian real on the translation of functional currency costs into us dollars 
sg a for included a provision of million for expiring tax credits in brazil 
foreign exchange results for were losses of million compared to gains of million for driven by the impact of continued volatility of global currencies relative to the us dollar 
noncontrolling interests were million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interests share of period income at our non wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily in our european operations 
other income expense was million of net expense in compared to million of net income in other income expense for included a million gain related to the sale of an idled facility in canada 
segment ebit decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease primarily resulted from lower gross profit driven by million of charges related to certain value added taxes in brazil  million of impairment charges in europe and higher sg a costs 
milling products segment milling products segment net sales decreased from primarily due to an decline in volumes  which accounts for approximately of the decrease in net sales 
volumes in our brazilian wheat milling business were well below last year  primarily as a result of lost sales opportunities due to the impact of an sap implementation on operations in the first half of the year 
volumes were also significantly below last year in our us corn milling business  resulting from a decline in demand for food aid products in north america 
these decreases were partially offset by the consolidation upon acquisition of a controlling interest in a north american wheat milling operation in the second quarter of the remaining decrease in net sales resulted from lower average selling prices 
cost of goods sold decreased from primarily due to lower corn and wheat milling sales volumes  lower average prices for corn and wheat and the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
these decreases were partially offset by a charge of million of charges related to certain value added taxes in brazil 
gross profit decreased from primarily as a result of a lower value product mix  particularly in corn milling  lower overall volumes in both wheat and corn milling and the million of charges related to certain value added taxes in brazil 
sg a expenses decreased primarily due to the impact of the weaker average brazilian real on the translation of functional currency costs into us dollars which was partially offset by higher selling costs in brazil 
in addition  costs increased as a result of the consolidation of a north american wheat milling business following our acquisition of a controlling interest in the second quarter of other income expense was zero in compared to income of million in which included a million gain on the sale of a wheat milling facility in brazil 

table of contents gain on acquisition of controlling interest was million related to the fair value adjustment of our minority investment in a north american wheat milling business upon acquisition of a controlling interest in the second quarter of segment ebit increased to million in from million in as lower gross profit and higher sg a costs were more than offset by the gain on acquisition of controlling interest in a north american wheat milling business as described above 
fertilizer segment fertilizer segment net sales decreased in when compared to as a result of a decline in fertilizer sales volumes  primarily in argentina  a decline in international fertilizer prices and a decline in port services provided by us  primarily in brazil 
volumes declined  mainly as a result of weaker demand for nitrogen fertilizers which impacted our argentine operations 
these volume declines accounted for approximately of the decrease in net sales  with lower selling prices accounting for approximately of the decline 
net sales were also reduced by the impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real on local currency revenues when translated into us dollars 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes  lower raw material costs in argentina  and the impact of the real devaluation 
these decreases were partially offset by higher industrial costs in argentina 
gross profit of million in declined from million in primarily as a result of lower sales volumes 
our port operations in brazil also reported lower margins resulting from lower throughput of import volumes as a result of a strike by federal customs workers during the year 
sg a declined to million in from million in primarily as a result of cost reduction efforts related to the brazilian port operations and the favorable impact of the devaluation of the brazilian real on local currency costs when translated to us dollars 
foreign exchange results were a loss of million in compared to a gain of million in noncontrolling interests were million in and million in and represents the noncontrolling interests share of period income at our non wholly owned subsidiaries in our brazilian port operations 
other income expense was expense of million in compared to income of million in primarily as a result of lower results in our moroccan joint venture 
segment ebit decreased in to million primarily as a result of lower fertilizer volumes  weaker results in our moroccan joint venture and our brazilian port operations 
interest a summary of consolidated interest income and expense for the periods indicated follows year ended december  us in millions interest income interest expense interest income decreased primarily due to lower income from interest bearing receivables and lower average interest bearing cash balances 
interest expense was substantially unchanged from interest expense includes facility commitment fees  amortization of deferred financing costs and charges on certain lending transactions  including certain intercompany loans and foreign currency conversions in brazil 

table of contents income tax expense in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to expense of million in the effective tax rate for was a benefit of which included a tax benefit of million related to the goodwill impairment charge in our sugar and bioenergy segment 
goodwill amortization is tax deductible in brazil 
this benefit reduced the effective tax rate for by 
the effective tax rate for was 
the lower effective tax rate for resulted primarily from the impact of the tax benefit on the goodwill impairment charge which more than offset higher taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions in discontinued operations in december  bunge entered into a definitive agreement with yara international asa yara under which yara will acquire bunge brazilian fertilizer business including blending facilities  brands and warehouses 
as a result of this transaction  bunge will exit its brazilian fertilizer business and has reported the results from these operations as discontinued operations 
additionally  in december bunge announced the sale of its interest in its fertilizer distribution venture to its partner growmark  inc and would cease its north american fertilizer distribution operations in  and has classified the results of those operations as discontinued operations 
the net after tax loss of million in is primarily the result of nonrecurring charges associated with the pending sale of the brazilian fertilizer operations  including an after tax charge of million related to an evaluation of the impact of the pending sale on recovery of long term receivables from farmers in brazil and a charge of million related to an income tax valuation allowance as the pending sale of the business has reduced our ability to utilize this tax asset 
results of operations for the discontinued businesses were a loss of million in and resulted from weakness in the brazilian fertilizer market and an after tax charge of million related to a provision for an legacy environmental claim from in brazil 
results from discontinued operations for were a loss of million 
net income attributable to bunge net income attributable to bunge declined by million to million from million in this decrease was primarily the result of an after tax charge of million related to the impairment of sugar and bioenergy segment goodwill  a loss of million for results of discontinued operations  net of tax as noted above and after tax impairment charges of million related to the write down of equity method investments and related loans 
compared to agribusiness segment agribusiness segment net sales increased due primarily to an increase in average selling prices for agricultural commodities resulting from global supply and demand factors  and higher volumes

sugar and bioenergy segment sugar and bioenergy segment net sales increased when compared to largely due to higher selling prices for sugar and ethanol 
volumes were substantially unchanged from with improved industrial volumes largely offset by lower sugar merchandising volumes 
cost of goods sold also increased due to the impact of higher global sugar prices on our merchandising business 
in addition  higher industrial volumes and the influence of higher global sugar and ethanol prices on the cost of sugarcane sourced from third parties in brazil also contributed to the increase in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in included approximately million of charges related to counterparty valuation adjustments as certain millers supplying a portion of our sugar merchandising volumes were not able to meet commitments as a result of the drought in brazil

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary financial objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity  balance sheet strength and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business efficiently 
we generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations  issuance of commercial paper  borrowings under various revolving credit facilities and term loans  as well as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes 
acquisitions and long lived assets are generally financed with a combination of equity and long term debt 
our current ratio  which is a widely used measure of liquidity and is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was and at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy  the objectives of which are to preserve capital  maximize liquidity and provide appropriate returns 
under our policy  cash balances have been primarily invested in bank time deposits with highly rated financial institutions and in government securities 
readily marketable inventories readily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories  such as soybeans  soybean meal  soybean oil  corn  wheat  and sugar that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
readily marketable inventories in our agribusiness segment were  million at december  and  million at december   respectively

financing arrangements and outstanding indebtedness we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure that enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
certain of bunge limited owned finance subsidiaries  bunge limited finance corp  bunge finance europe bv and bunge

revolving credit facilities at december   we had approximately  million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities  all of which was unused and available 
the following table summarizes these facilities as of the periods presented total availability borrowings outstanding commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities maturities december  december  december  us in millions commercial paper long term revolving credit facilities total borrowings under the revolving credit facilities that have maturities greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long term debt  consistent with the long term maturity of the underlying facilities 
however  individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short term in nature  bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each such individual borrowing matures 
our commercial paper program is supported by committed back up bank credit lines the liquidity facility equal to the amount of the commercial paper program provided by lending institutions that are rated at least a by standard poor and p by moody investor services 
the cost of borrowing under the liquidity facility would typically be higher than the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper program 
on june   moody investor services downgraded the credit ratings of certain financial institutions  including two banks with an aggregate commitment of million under our million liquidity facility 
as these banks no longer met the minimum ratings required to participate in the liquidity facility following the downgrades  these banks commitments under the liquidity facility were terminated and the amount available under the facility was reduced by million to million 
as a result of the reduction of the liquidity facility  the size of our commercial paper program was also simultaneously reduced to million 
our commercial paper program is our only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program 
in january  we increased the commitments under the liquidity facility to million and therefore simultaneously increased the size of our commercial paper program to million 
in october  we increased the available amount under our syndicated  million revolving credit facility which matures on november  to  million pursuant to the term of the facility agreement 
borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to  based on the credit ratings of our long term senior unsecured debt 
amounts under the credit facility that remain undrawn are subject to commitment fees payable each quarter based on the average undrawn portion of the credit facility at rates ranging from to per annum  based generally on the credit ratings of our long term senior unsecured debt

at december  and   million and million  respectively  were outstanding under these uncommitted short term credit lines 
short and long term debt our short and long term debt increased by  million at december  from december   primarily due to higher working capital levels 
for the year ended december   our average short and long term debt outstanding was approximately  million compared to  million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from higher inventories and commodity prices 
generally  our borrowings increase in times of rising commodity prices as we borrow to acquire inventory and fund margin calls on our short futures positions which are hedging physical inventories

our debt agreements do not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate maturity of our debt 
however  credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and  depending on their severity  could impede our ability to obtain credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms 
a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively relative to competitors with higher credit ratings 

table of contents our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants  including minimum net worth  minimum current ratio  a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and limitations on secured indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  interest rate swap agreements we may use interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and record the swaps at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in asc topic derivatives and hedging  is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset

each convertible perpetual preference share has an initial liquidation preference of  which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends 
the convertible perpetual preference shares carry an annual dividend rate of per share 
dividends are cumulative and are payable quarterly in arrears 
as a result of adjustments made to the initial conversion price because cash dividends paid on bunge limited common shares exceeded certain specified thresholds  each convertible perpetual preference share is convertible  at the holder option  at any time into approximately bunge limited common shares  based on the conversion price of per share  subject to certain additional anti dilution adjustments 
at any time on or after december   if the closing price of our common shares equals or exceeds of the conversion price for trading days during any consecutive trading days including the last trading day of such period  we may elect to cause the convertible perpetual preference shares to be automatically converted into bunge limited common shares at the then prevailing conversion price 
the convertible preference shares are not redeemable by us at any time 

table of contents cash flows our cash flow from operations varies depending on  among other items  the market prices and timing of the purchase and sale of our inventories

we also sell fertilizer to farmers  primarily in brazil  on credit as described below 
all of these activities are generally intended to be short term in nature 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography  which are  in turn  affected by commodity prices  currency exchange rates  crop input costs and crop quality and yields 
as a result  these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer crop and  in many cases  the farmer land and other assets 
on occasion  brazilian farm economics in certain regions and certain years  particularly and  have been adversely affected by factors including volatility in soybean prices  a steadily appreciating brazilian real and poor crop quality and yields 
as a result  certain farmers have defaulted on amounts owed 
while brazilian farm economics have improved  some brazilian farmers continue to face economic challenges due to high debt levels and a strong brazilian real 
upon farmer default  we generally initiate legal proceedings to recover the defaulted amounts 
however  the legal recovery process through the judicial system is a long term process  generally spanning a number of years 
as a 
table of contents result  once accounts have been submitted to the judicial process for recovery  we may also seek to renegotiate certain terms with the defaulting farmer in order to accelerate recovery of amounts owed 
in addition  we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and have increased collateral requirements for certain customers 
because brazilian farmer credit exposures are denominated in local currency  reported values are impacted by movements in the value of the brazilian real when translated into us dollars 
from december  to december   the brazilian real devalued by approximately  decreasing the reported farmer credit exposure balances when translated into us dollars 
brazilian fertilizer trade accounts receivable in our brazilian fertilizer operations  customer accounts receivable are intended to be short term in nature  and are expected to be repaid either in cash or through delivery to bunge of agricultural commodities when the related crop is harvested 
as the farmer cash flow is seasonal and is typically generated after the crop is harvested  the actual due dates of the accounts receivable are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizer and the anticipated date for the harvest and sale of the farmer crop 
these receivables may also be secured by the farmer crop 
we initiate legal proceedings against customers to collect amounts owed which are in default 
in some cases  we have renegotiated amounts that were in legal proceedings  including to secure the subsequent year crop 
we periodically evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality of individual accounts  considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed 
we continuously review defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis 
we consider all accounts in legal collections processes to be defaulted and past due 
for such accounts  we determine the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral  net of estimated costs to sell 
for all renegotiated accounts current and past due  we consider changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions  our historical experience related to renegotiated accounts and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
on december   bunge entered into a definitive agreement with yara international asa yara under which yara will acquire bunge brazilian fertilizer business including blending facilities  brands and warehouses 
included in this transaction are current fertilizer trade accounts receivables 
long term fertilizer receivables are excluded from the transaction 
as a result of the entry into the agreement for the sale of the brazilian fertilizer operations we reassessed the collectability of certain of the long term receivables as a result of our exit from the brazilian fertilizer market

secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts advance cash payments to suppliers against contractual obligations to deliver specified quantities of soybeans in the future and secured advances to suppliers advances to suppliers against commitments to deliver soybeans in the future  primarily in brazil

the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which are generally one year or less  with the exception of guarantees issued under certain brazilian government programs  primarily from and  where terms are up to five years 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the third parties and bunge would be required to perform under the guarantees  bunge has obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   bunge had approximately million of tangible property that had been pledged to bunge as collateral against certain of these refinancing arrangements 
bunge evaluates the likelihood of customer repayments of the amounts due under these guarantees based upon an expected loss analysis and records the fair value of such guarantees as an obligation in its consolidated financial statements 
bunge recorded obligation related to these outstanding guarantees was million at december  bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated joint ventures 
the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings which have maturity dates in  and there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees 
at december   bunge recorded no obligation related to these guarantees 
bunge issued guarantees to certain financial institutions which are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars and barges 
these guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at conclusion of the lease term 
these leases expire in at december   bunge recorded obligation related to these guarantees was million 
in addition  bunge limited has provided full and unconditional parent level guarantees of the indebtedness outstanding under certain senior credit facilities and senior notes entered into  or issued by  its owned subsidiaries 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet includes debt with a carrying amount of  million related to these guarantees 
this debt includes the senior notes issued by two of our owned finance subsidiaries  bunge limited finance corp 
and bunge na finance na there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp  bunge na finance na or any other subsidiary of ours to transfer funds to bunge limited 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated 
payments due by period us in millions total and there after other short term borrowings variable interest rate obligations long term debt interest obligations on fixed rate debt non cancelable operating lease obligations capital commitments freight supply agreements inventory purchase commitments power supply purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations we also have variable interest rate obligations on certain of our outstanding borrowings 
excludes unamortized net gains of million related to terminated interest rate swap agreements recorded in long term debt 
represents future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available 
payments to be received by us under such relet agreements are anticipated to be approximately million in these agreements range from two months to approximately five years in the case of ocean freight vessels and to years in the case of railroad services 
actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity 
the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions 
as of december   bunge had gross unrecognized tax liabilities of million  including related interest and penalties 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
does not include obligations for pension and postretirement benefits for which we expect to make employer contributions of million in we also expect to make a significant contribution to our plans in future years 
in addition  we have entered into partnership agreements for the production of sugarcane 
these agreements have an average life of five years and cover approximately  hectares of land under cultivation 
amounts owed under these agreements are dependent on several variables including the quantity of sugarcane produced per hectare  the total recoverable sugar atr per ton of sugarcane produced and the price for each kilogram of atr as determined by consecana  the s o paulo state sugarcane and sugar and ethanol council 
in  and  bunge made payments related to these agreements of million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts million  million and million in  and  respectively  were advances for future production and million  million and million were included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for  and  respectively 

table of contents employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our post retirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers are stated at the historical carrying amounts net of write offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
we establish an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to farmers based on historical experience  farming  economic and other market conditions as well as specific identified customer collection issues 
uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined that collection of the balance is unlikely 
we follow the accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels  defined as portfolio segments and classes 
based upon an analysis of credit losses and risk factors to be considered in determining the allowance for credit losses  we have determined that the long term receivables from farmers in brazil is a single portfolio segment 
we evaluate this single portfolio segment by class of receivables  which is defined as a level of information below a portfolio segment in which the receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring risk 
we have identified accounts in legal collection processes and renegotiated amounts as classes of long term receivables from farmers 
valuation allowances for accounts in legal collection processes are determined by us on individual accounts based on the fair value of the collateral provided as security for the secured advance or credit sale 
the fair value is determined using a combination of internal and external resources  including published information concerning brazilian land values by region 
for determination of the valuation allowances for renegotiated amounts  we consider historical experience with the individual farmers  current weather and crop conditions  as well as the fair value of non crop collateral 
for both classes  a long term receivable from farmers in brazil is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if we determine it to be probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected 
recognition of interest income on secured advances to farmers is suspended once the farmer defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable 
no additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery  where amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income 
inventories and derivatives we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we are exposed to loss in the event of non performance by counterparties to certain of these contracts 
the risk of non performance is routinely monitored and adjustments recorded  if necessary  to account for potential non performance 

table of contents different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these derivative instruments could result in additional fair value adjustments and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold  foreign exchange or interest expense 
we did not have significant allowances relating to non performance by counterparties at december   and our readily marketable commodity inventories  forward purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options are primarily valued at fair value 
readily marketable inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  may be sold without significant additional processing and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs 
we estimate fair values of commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the fair values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold 
if we used different methods or factors to estimate fair values  amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectability of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added or other similar transactional taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management assumption about the collectability of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  percentages of export sales  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december  and  the allowance for recoverable taxes was million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and in cases where we determine that recovery is doubtful  recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts 
property  plant and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property  plant and equipment assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property  plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property  plant and equipment assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
bunge recorded no significant impairment charges for the year ended december  or in  we recorded pre tax non cash impairment charges of million in cost of goods sold  which consisted of million related to the write down of a european oilseed processing and refining facility  million related to the closure of an older  less efficient oilseed processing facility in the 
table of contents united states and a co located corn oil extraction line  million related to the closure of oilseed processing and refining facilities in europe with restructuring of our european footprint  million related to a long term supply contract acquired in connection with a wheat mill acquisition in brazil  million related to the write down of an older and less efficient brazilian distribution center and million related to the write down of an administrative office in brazil 
investments in affiliates we continually review our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is less than our carrying value  the financial condition  operating performance and near term prospects of the investment  which include general market conditions specific to the investment or the industry in which it operates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value 
in  we recorded million of pre tax  non cash impairment charges in other income expense net and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in our agribusiness segment relating to the write down of two separate equity method investments in european biodiesel producers and a related loan to a european biodiesel joint venture 
we also recorded million of pre tax  non cash impairment charges in other income expense net and million in selling  general and administrative expenses in our sugar and bioenergy segment relating to an equity investment in and a related loan to a north american corn ethanol joint venture 
the fair values of the investments were determined utilizing projected cash flows of the joint ventures 
we did not have any significant impairment charges relating to our equity investments for the year ended december  or goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in a business acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
we selected the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe it is comparable to what would be used by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise 
these analyses require the use of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  growth rates and terminal values and the timing of expected future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit 
sensitivity analyses are performed in order to assess the reasonableness of assumptions 
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step of the process is necessary 
the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying values 
the fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined using estimated discount rates 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value  the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its fair value 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if estimates or related projections of the fair values of reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 

table of contents we performed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of  and for the year ended december   we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million for the goodwill in our sugar and bioenergy segment 
for all other reporting units  the estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined to be sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values with no indication of impairment 
there were no significant impairment charges relating to goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets for any of the years ended december  and contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil and tax claims in argentina  and have accrued our estimates of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various us and foreign primarily in canada  europe and brazil pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and postretirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
a one percentage point decrease in the aggregate in the assumed discount rate on the us and foreign defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans would increase annual expense by million and million  respectively  and would increase the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the aggregate in the assumed discount rate on the us and foreign defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans would decrease annual expense by million and million  respectively  and would decrease the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term asset return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million and million  respectively 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  as a result of uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential 
table of contents liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us  brazil  argentina and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
at december  and  we had recorded tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets

the adoption of this standard may expand bunge disclosures but is not expected to impact bunge consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in  among other things  agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we actively monitor and manage these various market risks associated with our business activities 
our risk management decisions take place in various locations but exposure limits are centrally set and monitored 
we have a corporate risk management group which analyzes and monitors various risk exposures globally  as well as risk management professionals in each of our operating regions 
additionally  our board of directors finance and risk policy committee oversees  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and limits 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs and for positioning our overall portfolio relative to expected market movements in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily with major financial institutions  commodity exchanges in the case of commodity futures and options  or approved exchange clearing shipping companies in the case of ocean freight 
while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  for hedged exposures those fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures 
the derivative instruments that we use for hedging purposes are intended to reduce the volatility on our results of operations  however  they can occasionally result in earnings volatility  which may be material 

table of contents credit and counterparty risk through our normal business activities  we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through normal commercial sales and purchases  including forward commitments to buy or sell  and through various other over the counter otc derivative instruments that we utilize to manage risks inherent in our business activities 
we define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations 
the exposure is measured based upon several factors  including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties and unrealized gains from both cash contracts and otc derivative instruments including forward purchase and sale contracts 
credit and counterparty risk also includes sovereign credit risk 
we actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through credit analysis by local credit staffs and review by various local and corporate committees which monitor counterparty performance 
we record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis 
during periods of tight conditions in global credit markets  downturns in regional or global economic conditions  and or significant price volatility  credit and counterparty risks are heightened 
this increased risk is monitored through  among other things  increased communication with key counterparties  management reviews and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk 
in addition  we have limited new credit extensions in certain cases and reduced our use of non exchange cleared derivative instruments 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food and feed industries  from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food ingredients 
as a result  we purchase and or produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  softseeds including sunflower seed  rapeseed and canola and related oil and meal derived from them  wheat and corn 
in addition  we grow and purchase sugarcane to produce sugar  ethanol and electricity 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
as described above  we are also subject to the risk of counterparty non performance under forward purchase or sale contracts 
from time to time  we have experienced instances of counterparty non performance  including as a result of significant declines in counterparty profitability under these contracts due to significant movements in commodity prices between the time the contracts were executed and the contractual forward delivery period 
we enter into various agricultural commodity derivative contracts with the primary objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for and produced in our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are generally a combination of volume and value at risk var limits 
we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts  and over the counter and exchange traded derivative instruments  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing all of our commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period where available or utilizing a close proxy 
var is calculated on the net position and monitored at the and confidence intervals 
in addition  scenario analysis and stress testing are performed 
for example  one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss 
table of contents in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant component of our operating costs 
the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels  global economic conditions and other factors 
we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
our time charter agreements generally have terms ranging from two months to approximately eight years 
we use financial derivatives  known as freight forward agreements  to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs 
the ocean freight derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
energy risk we purchase various energy commodities such as bunker fuel  electricity and natural gas that are used to operate our manufacturing facilities and ocean freight vessels 
the energy commodities are subject to price risk 
we use financial derivatives  including exchange traded and otc swaps and options for various purposes  including to manage our exposure to volatility in energy costs 
these energy derivatives are included in other current assets and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
our primary foreign currency exposures are the brazilian real  the euro and other european currencies  the argentine peso and the chinese yuan renminbi 
to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into derivative instruments  such as forward contracts and swaps and foreign currency options 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures 
the potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates as of december  was not material 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
included in other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
interest rate risk we have debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure related to our debt portfolio 

table of contents the aggregate fair value of our short and long term debt  based on market yields at december   was  million with a carrying value of  million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest yields on our debt at december  would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest yields on our debt at december  would cause an increase of approximately million in the fair value of our debt 
a hypothetical change in libor would result in a change of approximately million in our interest expense 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and tjlp 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the potential impact of any currency movements 
derivative instruments interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps used by us as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded contemporaneously in earnings 
certain of these swap agreements may be designated as fair value hedges 
the carrying amount of the associated hedged debt is also adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value arising from changes in benchmark interest rates 
ineffectiveness is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
we may enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing certain of our interest rate exposures 
we may also enter into interest rate basis swap agreements that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of such interest rate basis swap agreements are recorded in earnings 
there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december  or we recognized approximately zero  million and million as a reduction in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to interest rate swap agreements outstanding during the respective periods 
in addition  during the years ended december   and  we recognized gains of approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  related to the amortization of deferred gains on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange derivatives we use a combination of foreign exchange forward swap and option contracts in certain of our operations to mitigate the risk from exchange rate fluctuations in connection with certain commercial and balance sheet exposures 
the foreign exchange forward swap and option contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges 
we may also use net investment hedges to partially offset the translation adjustments arising from the remeasurement of our investment in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items

non exchange traded swaps  options and forwards are presented on a gross short and long position basis 

table of contents commodity derivatives we use derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices 
we generally use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on agricultural commodity inventories and forward purchase and sale contracts  but may also from time to time enter into otc commodity transactions  including swaps  which are settled in cash at maturity or termination based on exchange quoted futures prices 
changes in fair values of exchange traded futures contracts representing the unrealized gains and or losses on these instruments are settled daily generally through our wholly owned futures clearing subsidiary 
forward purchase and sale contracts are primarily settled through delivery of agricultural commodities 
while we consider these exchange traded futures and forward purchase and sale contracts to be effective economic hedges  we do not designate or account for the majority of our commodity contracts as hedges 
changes in fair values of these contracts and related readily marketable agricultural commodity inventories are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income 
the forward contracts require performance of both us and the contract counterparty in future periods 
contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges 
contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle

ocean freight derivatives we use derivative instruments referred to as freight forward agreements  or ffas  and ffa options to hedge portions of our current and anticipated ocean freight costs 
a portion of the ocean freight derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges of our firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels 
changes in the fair value of the ocean freight derivatives that are qualified  designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings
