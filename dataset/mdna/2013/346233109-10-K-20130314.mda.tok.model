mineral resources segment earnings benefited from increased lease bonus revenues  higher production volume and earnings attributable to our exploration and production operations from our acquisition of credo in third quarter  partially offset by lower oil and natural gas prices  increased costs associated with developing our water resources initiatives  and increased depletion and production severance taxes due to higher production volumes 
fiber resources segment earnings increased principally as a result of higher levels of harvesting activity 
general and administrative expense includes  in transaction costs paid to outside advisors associated with our acquisition of credo in share based compensation increased principally as a result of our higher stock price in and its impact on cash settled awards 

table of contents interest expense includes a  loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the amendment and extension of our term loan 
real estate segment earnings were negatively impacted by  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with residential development projects located near atlanta  denver  and the texas gulf coast and with our decision to acquire certain assets from cl realty and temco  ventures in which we own a percent interest 
segment earnings were positively impacted by increased undeveloped land sales and higher residential lot and tract sales 
in addition  segment earnings were positively impacted by  as result of settled litigation and reallocation from us to noncontrolling financial interests of a previously recognized loss related to foreclosure of a lien on a property owned by a consolidated venture 
mineral resources segment earnings declined primarily due to lower lease bonus revenues and increased costs associated with developing our water resources initiatives 
these items were partially offset by increased oil production volumes and higher average oil prices 
fiber resources segment earnings decreased principally due to lower harvest volume as a result of selling over  acres of timberland since year end general and administrative expenses includes  in costs paid to outside advisors associated with proposed private debt offerings that we withdrew as a result of deterioration of terms available to us in the credit markets 
share based compensation decreased principally as a result of a decline in our stock price in and its impact on cash settled awards 
gain on sale of assets represents the sale of about  acres of timberland for  in accordance with our strategic initiatives which we completed in real estate segment earnings declined principally due to lower undeveloped land sales from our retail sales program and  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with residential development projects located near atlanta and fort worth  and commercial real estate tract near the texas gulf coast 
mineral resources segment earnings declined principally due to lower lease bonus revenues as a result of reduced leasing activity by exploration and production companies that concentrated investments in drilling activities to hold existing leases rather than leasing new mineral interests in our basins 
this decline in lease bonus revenue was partially offset by increased oil and natural gas production and higher oil prices 
fiber resources segment earnings decreased principally due to reduced harvest activity resulting from the sale of over  acres of timberland since first quarter and delaying harvest plans on about  acres classified as held for sale 
gain on sale of assets represents the sale of about  acres of timberland for  in accordance with our strategic initiatives 
interest expense decreased principally due to lower interest rates as a result of the maturity of our interest rate swap agreement  lower average debt levels outstanding and decreased amortization of prepaid loan fees due to refinancing and extending the maturity date of our senior credit facility 
current market conditions current us single family residential market conditions are showing signs of stability with improvement in various markets  however  high unemployment rates  difficult financing environment for purchasers and competition from foreclosure inventory continue to negatively influence housing markets 
it is difficult to predict 
table of contents when and at what rate these broader negative conditions will improve 
declining finished lot inventories and lack of real estate development is increasing demand for our developed lots  principally in the texas markets 
multifamily market conditions continue to be strong  with many markets experiencing healthy occupancy levels and positive rent growth 
this improvement has been driven primarily by limited new construction activity  reduced single family mortgage credit availability  and the increased propensity to rent among the to year old demographic of the us population 
oil prices have weakened as compared with reflecting market concerns about world economic activity and oil demand 
natural gas prices have remained near low historical levels due to abundant supplies and high inventories 
shale resource drilling and production remains strong and working natural gas inventories are expected to remain relatively high 
in the east texas basin  exploration and production companies continue to focus drilling on high liquid rich gas prospects due to relatively high condensate and natural gas liquid prices 
in the gulf coast basin  in louisiana  activity has increased as operators have shifted exploration efforts to oil and high liquid natural gas plays 
these conditions may impact the demand for new mineral leases on our owned minerals  new exploration activity and the amount of revenues we receive 
pine sawtimber prices are beginning to show signs of improvement due to increased demand for solid wood products  principally lumber  while pine pulpwood demand remains steady and pricing is relatively flat

table of contents and extension of our senior credit facility  which was partially offset by a net increase in our debt of  which is principally due to  in non recourse borrowings used to finance a unit  multifamily investment property acquired in fourth quarter liquidity and contractual obligations liquidity in  we entered into a second amended and restated revolving and term credit agreement in order to consolidate previous amendments and to effect the following principal amendments to increase the term loan commitment from  to  extend the maturity date of the revolving loan to september  with a one year extension option and of the term loan to september   reduce the interest rate spread over libor from percent to percent  and eliminate the libor rate floor of percent  increase the minimum interest coverage ratio from x to x  reduce the unused fee rate from percent per annum to percent percent per annum based on usage  and eliminate the minimum value to commitment ratio covenant and replace it with a reduction to the borrowing base to the extent the ratio of the value of assets in the borrowing base to the aggregate commitments under the facility is less than x 
we incurred fees of  related to this amendment 
the amendment and restatement of the term loan was an extinguishment of debt under the accounting guidance and as result  we recognized a  loss in which is included in interest expense 
on september  we acquired percent of outstanding stock of credo in an all cash transaction for per share  representing an equity purchase price of approximately  in addition  we paid in full  of credo s outstanding debt 
this transaction was funded with approximately  in borrowings from our term loan   in borrowings from our revolving line of credit with the balance paid from cash and short term investments 
at year end  our senior secured credit facility provides for a  term loan and a  revolving line of credit

our senior credit facility and other debt agreements contain financial covenants customary for such agreements including minimum levels of interest coverage and limitations on leverage 
at year end  we were in compliance with the financial covenants of these agreements

to make additional investments  acquisitions  or distributions  we must maintain available liquidity equal to percent of the aggregate commitments in place 
at year end  the minimum liquidity requirement was  compared with  in actual available liquidity based on the unused borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility plus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
as of year end  we were in compliance with these requirements 
the failure to maintain such minimum liquidity does not constitute a default or event of default of our senior secured credit facility 
in addition  we may elect to make distributions so long as the total leverage ratio is less than  the interest coverage is greater than  the revenues capital expenditures ratio exceeds  and available liquidity is not less than  in  we obtained a loan for construction of a unit multifamily development project located near austin which provides up to  in financing

at year end  we participate in three partnerships that have total assets of  and total liabilities of  which includes  of borrowings classified as current maturities 
these partnerships are managed by third parties who intend to extend or refinance these borrowings  however  there is no assurance that this can be done 
although these borrowings are guaranteed by third parties  we may under certain circumstances elect or be required to provide additional equity to these partnerships 
we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
our investment in these partnerships is  at year end these three partnerships are variable interest entities 
cibolo canyons san antonio  texas cibolo canyons consists of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa development owned by third parties and a mixed use development we own 
we have about  invested in cibolo canyons at year end resort hotel  spa and golf development in  we entered into agreements to facilitate third party construction and ownership of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa  which includes a  room destination resort and two pga tour tournament players club tpc golf courses 
under these agreements  we agreed to transfer to third party owners acres of undeveloped land  to provide  cash and to provide  of other consideration principally consisting of golf course construction materials  all of which has been provided 

table of contents in exchange for our commitment to the resort  the third party owners assigned to us certain rights under an agreement between the third party owners and a legislatively created special improvement district sid 
this agreement includes the right to receive from the sid nine percent of hotel occupancy revenues and percent of other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the sid through the amount we receive will be net of annual ad valorem tax reimbursements by the sid to the third party owners of the resort through in addition  these payments will be net of debt service  if any  on bonds issued by the sid collateralized by hotel occupancy tax and other resort sales tax through the amounts we collect under this agreement are dependent on several factors including the amount of revenues generated by and ad valorem taxes imposed on the resort and the amount of any applicable debt service incurred by the sid 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount and timing of collections under this agreement 
until these uncertainties are clarified  amounts collected under the agreement will be accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the resort development 
the resort began operations in january in  we received  in reimbursements from the sid 
since inception  we have received  in reimbursements and have accounted for this as a reduction of our investment 
at year end  we have  invested in the resort development 
mixed use development the mixed use development we own consists of  acres planned to include about  residential lots and about commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses  of which lots and commercial acres have been sold through year end in  we entered into an agreement with the sid providing for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed use development 
reimbursements are subject to review and approval by the sid and unreimbursed amounts accrue interest at percent 
the sid s funding for reimbursements is principally derived from its ad valorem tax collections and bond proceeds collateralized by ad valorem taxes  less debt service on these bonds and annual administrative and public service expenses 
because the amount of each reimbursement is dependent on several factors  including timing of sid approval and the sid having an adequate tax base to generate funds that can be used to reimburse us  there is uncertainty as to the amount and timing of reimbursements under this agreement 
we expect to recover our investment from lot and tract sales and reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs from the sid 
we have not recognized income from interest due  but not collected 
as these uncertainties are clarified  we will modify our accounting accordingly 
through year end  we have submitted and received approval for reimbursement of about  of infrastructure costs and have received reimbursements totaling  of which  was received in   was received in and  in and  in  all were accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the mixed use development 
at year end  we have  in approved and pending reimbursements  excluding interest 
at year end  we have  invested in the mixed use development 
accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results of operations and involve significant assumptions  estimates and judgments that are difficult to determine 
we must make these assumptions  estimates and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  differ from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a 
table of contents combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales in allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold  we must estimate current and future real estate values 
our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods to years from today and are dependent on numerous assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when we sell real estate from projects that are not finished  we must estimate future development costs through completion 
differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results 
impairment of real estate long lived assets measuring real assets for impairment requires estimating future fair values based on our intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and the residual value of assets under review  primarily undeveloped land 
depending on the asset under review  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as discounting expected future cash flows  determining resale values by market  or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
changes in economic conditions  demand for real estate  and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties measuring oil and natural gas properties for impairment requires significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in commodity prices for oil and natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
due to the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
goodwill impairment measuring goodwill for impairment which is required annually requires estimation of future cash flows and fair values of related assets based on certain key factors  including future selling prices and volumes  observable market inputs  weighted average cost of capital  operating expenses and various other projected operating economic factors 
changes in economic and operating conditions can affect these assumptions and could result in additional interim testing and goodwill impairment charges in the future periods 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we have limited historical experience as a stand alone company so we utilized alternative methods in determining our valuation assumptions 
the expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards 
in and  the expected stock price volatility was based on a blended rate utilizing our historical volatility and historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
in and  the expected stock price volatility was based on historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity and historical trends 
asset retirement obligations we make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and natural gas properties 
estimating future costs involves significant assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  timing of settlements  discount rates and inflation rates 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 

table of contents income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
if needed  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in addition  when we believe a tax position is supportable but the outcome uncertain  we include the item in our tax return but do not recognize the related benefit in our provision for taxes 
instead  we record a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which represents our expectation of the most likely outcome considering the technical merits and specific facts of the position 
changes to liabilities are only made when an event occurs that changes the most likely outcome  such as settlement with the relevant tax authority  expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax law  or recent court rulings 
adjustments to temporary differences  permanent differences or uncertain tax positions could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
oil and natural gas reserves the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves is a significant estimate which affect the amount of non cash depletion expense we record as well as impairment analysis we perform 
on an annual basis  our consulting petroleum engineering firm  with our assistance  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide or domestic production and consumption and are outside our control 
adopted and pending accounting pronouncements we adopted two new accounting pronouncements in  the adoption of which did not have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
there are two pending accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in and adoption is not anticipated to have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
please read note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years 
our real estate  oil and natural gas properties  timber  and property and equipment are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  the cost of real estate sold  timber cut  and depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is principally related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in our variable rate debt  which was  at year end and  at year end the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months on our variable rate debt at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments 
table of contents will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose 
at year end change in interest rates in thousands foreign currency risk we have no exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we have exposure to commodity price fluctuations which can materially affect our revenues and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to commodity price risks associated with the sale of oil and natural gas  we may periodically enter into derivative hedging transactions for a portion of our estimated production 
we do not have any commodity derivative positions outstanding at year end
