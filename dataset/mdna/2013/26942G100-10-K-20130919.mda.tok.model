competition we face strong competition in our primary market area for retail deposits and the origination of loans

the number of such competitor locations has increased significantly in recent years 
our competition for loans also comes from banks  thrifts and credit unions in addition to mortgage bankers and brokers 
our principal market areas can be characterized as markets with moderately increasing incomes  relatively low unemployment  increasing wealth particularly in the growing resort areas such as bozeman  and moderate population growth 
lending activities general 
american federal savings bank primarily originates one to four family residential real estate loans and  to a lesser extent  commercial real estate loans  real estate construction loans  home equity loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans include loans on multi family dwellings  loans on nonresidential property and loans on developed and undeveloped land 
home equity loans include loans secured by the borrower s primary residence 
typically  the property securing such loans is subject to a prior lien 
consumer loans consist of loans secured by collateral other than real estate  such as automobiles  recreational vehicles and boats 
personal loans and lines of credit are made on deposits held by the bank and on an unsecured basis 
commercial business loans consist of business loans and lines of credit on a secured and unsecured basis

fee income 
american federal savings bank receives lending related fee income from a variety of sources 
its principal source of this income is from the origination and servicing of sold mortgage loans 
fees generated from mortgage loan servicing  which generally consists of collecting mortgage payments  maintaining escrow accounts  disbursing payments to investors and foreclosure processing for loans held by others  were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
other loan related fee income for contract collections  late charges  credit life commissions and credit card fees were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
loan maturity schedule 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity of the loan portfolio of the bank at june  balances exclude deferred loan fees and allowance for loan losses 
scheduled principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of a loan is typically substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give american federal savings bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property  subject to the mortgage  and the loan is not paid off 
all mortgage loans are shown to be maturing based on the date of the last payment required by the loan agreement  except as noted 
loans having no stated maturity  those without a scheduled payment  demand loans and matured loans  are shown as due within six months

residential lending 
the bank s primary lending activity consists of the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans secured by property located in the bank s market area 
approximately of the bank s loans as of june  were comprised of such loans 
american federal generally originates one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts of up to of the lesser of the appraised value or the selling price of the mortgaged property without requiring private mortgage insurance 
a mortgage loan originated by the bank  whether fixed rate or adjustable rate  can have a term of up to years 
the bank holds substantially all of its adjustable rate and its  and year fixed rate loans in portfolio 
adjustable rate loans limit the periodic interest rate adjustment and the minimum and maximum rates that may be charged over the term of the loan 
the bank s fixed rate year and year loans are held in portfolio or sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions 
generally  all year fixed rate loans are sold in the secondary market 
the volume of loan sales is dependent on the volume  type and term of loan originations 
the bank obtains a significant portion of its noninterest income from servicing of loans that it has sold 
the bank offers many of the fixed rate loans it originates for sale in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
this means that we process the borrower s payments and send them to the purchaser of the loan 
this retention of servicing enables the bank to increase fee income and maintain a relationship with the borrower 
servicing income was  for the year ended june  at june   american federal savings bank had million in residential mortgage loans and million in commercial real estate loans sold with servicing retained 
american federal savings bank does not ordinarily purchase home mortgage loans from other financial institutions 
property appraisals on real estate securing the bank s single family residential loans are made by state certified and licensed independent appraisers who are approved annually by the board of directors 
appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies 
american federal savings bank generally obtains title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated 
on occasion  refinancings of mortgage loans are approved using title reports instead of title insurance 
title reports are also allowed on home equity loans 
borrowers generally remit funds with each monthly payment of principal and interest  to a loan escrow account from which american federal savings bank makes disbursements for such items as real estate taxes and hazard and mortgage insurance premiums as they become due 
home equity loans 
american federal savings bank also originates home equity loans 
these loans are secured by the borrowers primary residence  but are typically subject to a prior lien  which may or may not be held by the bank 
at june   million or of our total loans were home equity loans 
borrowers may use the proceeds from the bank s home equity loans for many purposes  including home improvement  debt consolidation  or other purchasing needs 
the bank offers fixed rate  fixed payment home equity loans as well as variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
fixed rate home equity loans typically have terms of not longer than years 
home equity loans are secured by real estate but they have historically carried a greater risk than first lien residential mortgages because of the existence of a prior lien on the property securing the loan  as well as the flexibility the borrower has with respect to the loan proceeds 
american federal savings bank attempts to minimize this risk by maintaining conservative underwriting policies on such loans 
we generally make home equity loans for up to only of appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral  less the amount of any existing prior liens on the property securing the loan 
commercial real estate and land loans 
american federal savings bank originates commercial real estate mortgage and land loans  including both developed and undeveloped land loans  and loans on multi family dwellings 
commercial real estate and land loans made up of the bank s total loan portfolio  or million at june  the majority of these loans are non residential commercial real estate loans 
american federal savings bank s commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily permanent loans secured by improved property such as office buildings  retail stores  commercial warehouses and apartment buildings 
the terms and conditions of each loan are tailored to the needs of the borrower and based on the financial strength of the project and any guarantors 
generally  commercial real estate loans originated by the bank will not exceed of the appraised value or the selling price of the property  whichever is less 
the average loan size is approximately  and is typically made with fixed rates of interest and to year maturities 
upon maturity  the loan is repaid or the terms and conditions are renegotiated 
generally  all originated commercial real estate loans are secured by property located in the state of montana and within the market area of the bank 
american federal savings bank s largest single commercial real estate loan had a balance of approximately million million is guaranteed by rural development of the us department of agriculture  leaving approximately million unguaranteed on june   and is secured by a detention facility 
real estate construction lending 
american federal savings bank also lends funds for the construction of one to four family homes and commercial real estate 
real estate construction loans are made both to individual homeowners for the construction of their primary residence and  to a lesser extent  to local builders for the construction of pre sold houses or houses that are being built for sale in the future 
real estate construction loans accounted for million or of the bank s loan portfolio at june  consumer loans 
as part of its strategy to invest in higher yielding shorter term loans  american federal savings bank emphasized growth of its consumer lending portfolio in recent years 
this portfolio includes personal loans secured by collateral other than real estate  unsecured personal loans and lines of credit  and loans secured by deposits held by the bank 
as of june   consumer loans totaled million or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
these loans consist primarily of auto loans  rv loans  boat loans  personal loans and credit lines and deposit account loans 
consumer loans are originated in the bank s market area and generally have maturities of up to years 
for loans secured by savings accounts  american federal savings bank will lend up to of the account balance on single payment loans and up to for monthly payment loans 
consumer loans have a shorter term and generally provide higher interest rates than residential loans 
consumer loans can be helpful in improving the spread between average loan yield and cost of funds and at the same time improve the matching of the maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
although the amount of such loans declined slightly over levels  increasing consumer loans continues to be a major part of the bank s strategy of operating more like a commercial bank than a traditional savings bank 
the underwriting standards employed by american federal savings bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s credit history and an assessment of the applicant s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
the stability of the applicant s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment  and additionally from any verifiable secondary income 
creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration  however  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount 
commercial business loans 
commercial business loans amounted to million  or of the bank s total loan portfolio at june  american federal savings bank s commercial business loans are traditional business loans and are not secured by real estate 
such loans may be structured as unsecured lines of credit or may be secured by inventory  accounts receivable or other business assets 
while the commercial business loan portfolio amounted to only of the total portfolio at june   american federal intends to try to increase such lending by focusing on market segments which it has not previously emphasized  such as business loans to doctors  lawyers  architects and other professionals as well as to small businesses within its market area 
our management believes that this strategy provides opportunities for growth  without significant additional cost outlays for staff and infrastructure 
commercial business loans of this nature usually involve greater credit risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the collateral we receive is typically related directly to the performance of the borrower s business which means that repayment of commercial business loans is dependent on the successful operations and income stream of the borrower s business 
such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions 
in addition  commercial lending generally requires substantially greater oversight efforts compared to residential real estate lending 
loans to one borrower 
under federal law  savings institutions such as the bank have  subject to certain exemptions  been required to limit credit concentrations to single borrowers to an amount equal to the greater of  or of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
as of june   our largest aggregation of loans to one borrower was approximately million 
this consisted of three loans two commercial real estate loans secured by two separate detention facilities and a commercial construction loan secured by a chemical dependency treatment facility 
the first commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of million  but of that amount  or million was sold to the montana board of investments  leaving a net principal balance payable to the bank of  the second commercial real estate loan is to the same borrower for another detention facility 
as of june   the principal balance on this loan was million 
however  of this loan is subject to a guarantee provided by the usda rural development 
due to the usda rural development guarantee  of the loan  or million  is not required under applicable banking regulations to be included in the bank s limitations to a single borrower  thus leaving approximately million subject to the lending limit described above 
the bank entered into an interest rate swap with a third party to change the underlying cash flows of the second loan to be a variable market rate tied to one month libor 
the commercial construction loan had a principal balance of  with a commitment of million to disburse the remaining amount as of june  as a result  the total amount subject to the lending limit at june  was million 
at june   these loans were performing in accordance with their terms 
the bank maintains the servicing for these loans 
loan solicitation and processing 
our customary sources of mortgage loan applications include repeat customers  walk ins  and referrals from home builders and real estate brokers 
we also advertise in local newspapers and on local radio and television 
we currently have the ability to accept online mortgage loan applications and provide pre approvals through our website 
our branch managers and loan officers located at our headquarters and in branches  have authority to approve certain types of loans when presented with a completed application 
other loans must be approved at our main offices as disclosed below 
no loan consultants or loan brokers are currently utilized for either residential or commercial lending activities 
after receiving a loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and verifications are obtained to confirm specific information relating to the loan applicant s employment  income and credit standing 
when required by our policies  an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is undertaken by an independent fee appraiser 
in connection with the loan approval process  our staff analyze the loan applications and the property involved 
officers and branch managers are granted lending authority based on the nature of the loan and the managers level of experience 
we have established a series of loan committees to approve any loans which may exceed the lending authority of particular officers or branch managers 
a quorum five directors of the board of directors is required for approval of any loan  or aggregation of loans to a single borrower  that exceeds  loan applicants are promptly notified of the decision by a letter setting forth the terms and conditions of the decision 
if approved  these terms and conditions include the amount of the loan  interest rate basis  amortization term  a brief description of real estate to be mortgaged  tax escrow and the notice of requirement of insurance coverage to be maintained 
we generally require title insurance on first mortgage loans and fire and casualty insurance on all properties securing loans  which insurance must be maintained during the entire term of the loan 
loan commitments 
we generally provide commitments to fund fixed and adjustable rate single family mortgage loans for periods up to days at a specified term and interest rate  and other loan categories for shorter time periods 
the total amount of our commitments to extend credit as of june   was approximately million  all of which was for residential mortgage loans 
nonperforming loans and problem assets collection procedures 
generally  our collection procedures provide that when a loan is or more days delinquent  the borrower is sent a past due notice 
if the loan becomes days delinquent  the borrower is sent a written delinquency notice requiring payment 
if the delinquency continues  subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower  including face to face meetings and counseling to resolve the delinquency 
all collection actions are undertaken with the objective of compliance with the fair debt collection act 
for mortgage loans and home equity loans  if the borrower is unable to cure the delinquency or reach a payment agreement  we will institute foreclosure actions 
if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated  paid in full or refinanced  the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt 
any property acquired as the result of foreclosure  or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
when real estate owned is acquired  it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs 
the initial recording of any loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
as of june   american federal savings bank had  of real estate owned  net of valuation loss allowance 
loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis and are placed on non accrual status when they are days or more delinquent 
loans may be placed on non accrual status at any time if  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is doubtful 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectibility of the loan 
at june   we had   net of specific reserves for loan losses of loans that were nonperforming and held on non accrual status

classified assets 
management  in compliance with regulatory guidelines  conducts an internal loan review program  whereby loans are placed or classified in categories depending upon the level of risk of nonpayment or loss 
these categories are special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
when a loan is classified as substandard or doubtful  management is required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount that is deemed prudent 
when management classifies a loan as a loss asset  an allowance equal up to of the loan balance is required to be established or the loan is required to be charged off 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of an allowance for both inherent risk associated with lending activities and specific problem assets 
management s evaluation of the classification of assets and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the board on a regular basis and by the regulatory agencies as part of their examination process 
in addition  each loan that exceeds  and each group of loans that exceeds  is monitored more closely 
the following table reflects our classified assets as of the dates indicated at june  dollars in thousands residential mortgage one to four family special mention substandard doubtful loss commercial real estate and land special mention substandard doubtful loss real estate construction special mention substandard doubtful loss home equity loans special mention substandard doubtful loss consumer loans special mention substandard doubtful loss commercial loans special mention substandard doubtful loss securities available for sale special mention substandard doubtful loss real estate owned repossessed property special mention substandard doubtful loss total classified loans and real estate owned allowance for loan losses and real estate owned the bank segregates its loan portfolio for loan losses into the following broad categories real estate loans residential mortgages 
one to four family  real estate construction  commercial real estate and land home equity loans  consumer loans  and commercial business loans 
the bank provides for a general allowance for losses inherent in the portfolio in the categories referenced above  which consists of two components general loss percentages which are calculated based on historical analyses and other factors such as volume and severity of delinquencies  local and national economy  underwriting standards  and other factors 
this portion of the allowance is calculated for inherent losses which probably exist as of the evaluation date even though they might not have been identified by the more objective processes used 
this is due to the risk of error and or inherent imprecision in the process 
this portion of the allowance is subjective in nature and requires judgments based on qualitative factors which do not lend themselves to exact mathematical calculations such as trends in delinquencies and non accruals  trends in volume  terms and portfolio mix  new credit products  changes in lending policies and procedures  and changes in the outlook for the local  regional and national economy 
at least quarterly  the management of the bank evaluates the need to establish an allowance against losses on loans and other assets based on estimated losses on specific loans and on any real estate owned when a finding is made that a loss is estimable and probable 
such evaluation includes a review of all loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured and considers  among other matters the estimated market value of the underlying collateral of problem loans  prior loss experience  economic conditions  and overall portfolio quality 
provisions for  or adjustments to  estimated losses are included in earnings in the period they are established 
at june   we had million in allowances for loan losses and  in allowance for valuation losses for other real estate owned 
while we believe we have established our existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that bank regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request that we significantly increase our allowance for loan losses  or that general economic conditions  a deteriorating real estate market  or other factors will not cause us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses  therefore negatively affecting our financial condition and earnings 
in making loans  we recognize that credit losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
it is our policy to review our loan portfolio  in accordance with regulatory classification procedures  on at least a quarterly basis

deposits are the major source of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
borrowings principally from the fhlb of seattle are also used to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  we derive funds from loan and mortgage backed securities principal repayments  and proceeds from the maturity  call and sale of mortgage backed securities and investment securities and from the sale of loans 
loan and mortgage backed securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan prepayments and deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and financial market conditions 
deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts 
deposit account terms vary  primarily as to the required minimum balance amount  the amount of time that the funds must remain on deposit and the applicable interest rate 
our current deposit products include certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from days to five years as well as checking  savings and money market accounts 
individual retirement accounts iras are included in certificates of deposit 
deposits are obtained primarily from residents of helena  bozeman  butte  townsend  billings  missoula  livingston  big timber  and hamilton 
we believe we are able to attract deposit accounts by offering outstanding service  competitive interest rates and convenient locations and service hours 
we use traditional methods of advertising to attract new customers and deposits  including radio  television  print media advertising and sales training and incentive programs for employees 
management believes that non residents of montana hold an insignificant number and amount of deposit accounts 
we pay interest rates on deposits which are competitive in our market 
interest rates on deposits are set by senior management  based on a number of factors  including projected cash flow  a current survey of a selected group of competitors rates for similar products  external data which may influence interest rates  investment opportunities and loan demand  and scheduled certificate maturities and loan and investment repayments 
core deposits are deposits that are more stable and somewhat less sensitive to rate changes 
they also represent a lower cost source of funds than rate sensitive  more volatile accounts such as certificates of deposit 
we believe that our core deposits are our checking  as well as now accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and ira accounts 
based on our historical experience  we include ira accounts funded by certificates of deposit as core deposits because they exhibit the principal features of core deposits in that they are stable and generally are not rate sensitive 
core deposits amounted to million or of the bank s deposits at june  this amount would be million or if ira certificates of deposit are excluded 
the presence of a high percentage of core deposits and  in particular  transaction accounts reflects in part our strategy to restructure our liabilities to more closely resemble the lower cost liabilities of a commercial bank 
however  a significant portion of our deposits remains in certificate of deposit form 
these certificates of deposit  if they mature and are renewed at higher rates  would result in an increase in our cost of funds

borrowings 
deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes 
however  as the need arises  or in order to take advantage of funding opportunities  we also borrow funds in the form of advances from the fhlb of seattle and other borrowings from pnc financial services  inc pnc to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
during the fiscal year ended june   our predecessor entity formed a special purpose subsidiary  eagle bancorp statutory trust i the trust  for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities in the amount of million 
our predecessor entity has issued subordinated debentures to the trust  and the coupon on the debentures matches the dividend payment on the trust preferred securities 
upon the closing of the second step conversion and reorganization  we assumed the obligations of our predecessor in connection with the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities 
for regulatory purposes  the securities qualify as tier capital  while for accounting purposes they are recorded as long term debt 
the securities have a year maturity and carried a fixed coupon of for the first five years  at which time the coupon became variable  at a spread of basis points over month libor

regulation set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to eagle and american federal 
these descriptions of laws and regulations as well as those contained elsewhere do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations 
legislative or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations or financial condition 
general as a federally chartered savings institution  american federal is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ which assumed jurisdiction over eagle and american federal after the close of eagle s june  fiscal year as its primary federal regulator  and the fdic  as the insurer of its deposits 
american federal is a member of the federal home loan bank  or fhlb  and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  which is administered by the fdic 
there are periodic examinations to evaluate american federal s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements 
under certain circumstances  the fdic may also examine american federal 
this regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes 
eagle  as a savings and loan holding company  is required to file certain reports with  is subject to examination by  and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of federal reserve board 
eagle is also subject to the rules and regulations of the sec under the federal securities laws 
see holding company regulation 
dodd frank act on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
one important change was the transfer of regulatory jurisdiction over federal savings association regulation from the office of thrift supervision to the occ 
the fdic will regulate state chartered savings associations 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act are subject to delayed effective dates and or require the issuance of implementing regulations 
this effect on operations cannot yet be assessed fully 
however  there is a significant possibility that the dodd frank act will  in the long run  increase regulatory burden  compliance cost and interest expense for eagle and the bank 
on july   under the requirements of the dodd frank act  our primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision  was merged with and into the office of the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
as a result  shortly after the conclusion of eagle s fiscal year of june   all federal savings associations including american federal came under the principal jurisdiction of a different  federal bank regulatory agency  the occ  which has historically regulated the national banks 
the occ has extensive experience in the regulation of community banks such as american federal but it is unclear without more experience how the change in federal regulatory agencies will impact american federal 
american federal will retain its federal thrift charter under the occ  but may evaluate other charter options in the future 
the dodd frank act also authorizes the board of governors of the federal reserve system to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like eagle  in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates 
as a result  the federal reserve board s current regulations applicable to bank holding companies  including  in the future  holding company capital requirements  will apply to savings and loan holding companies like eagle 
the capital requirements are expected to take effect in five years 
the dodd frank act will require the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
under the dodd frank act  the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than billion of assets 
the dodd frank act also created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as american federal savings bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadens the base for federal deposit insurance corporation insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  lastly  the dodd frank act directs the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
federal regulation of savings institutions the following description relates to both eagle and american federal s regulation through the completion of the fiscal year june   and a description of certain historical regulatory aspects 
office of the comptroller of the currency 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  as a result of the dodd frank act  has assumed regulatory oversight over the bank since the elimination of the office of thrift supervision as a separate regulatory agency 
american federal is required to file periodic reports with the office of the comptroller of the currency and is subject to periodic examinations 
the office of the comptroller of the currency has extensive enforcement authority over national banks and savings institutions such as the bank 
authority over eagle  which formerly resided with the office of thrift supervision  has been transferred to the federal reserve board as a result of enactment of the dodd frank act 
enforcement authority over eagle includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action  including misleading or untimely reports filed with federal bank regulatory agencies 
except under certain circumstances  public disclosure of final enforcement actions is required 
in addition  the investment  lending and branching authority of american federal also are prescribed by federal laws  which prohibit american federal from engaging in any activities not permitted by these laws 
for example  no savings institution may invest in non investment grade corporate debt securities 
in addition  the permissible level of investment by federal institutions in loans secured by non residential real property may not exceed of total capital  except with approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency 
federal savings institutions are generally authorized to branch nationwide 
american federal is in compliance with the noted restrictions 
american federal pays assessments to the office of the comptroller of the currency to fund its operations 
the general assessments  paid on a semi annual basis  are determined based on total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries 
american federal s general permissible lending limit for loans to one borrower is equal to the greater of  or of unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be lent  equal to of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  if the loan is fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral  which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion  but generally does not include real estate 
the federal banking agencies  have adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation  asset quality  earnings standards  internal controls and audit systems  interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 
if an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan  the appropriate federal banking agency may issue an enforceable order requiring correction of the deficiencies 
federal home loan bank system 
american federal is a member of the fhlb of seattle  which is one of regional fhlbs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions 
each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
it makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures  established by the board of directors of the fhlb  which are subject to the oversight of the federal housing finance board 
all advances from the fhlb are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
in addition  all long term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing 
as a member  american federal is required to purchase and maintain a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the fhlb of seattle 
the fhlbs have continued and continue to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects 
these contributions have affected adversely the level of fhlb dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future 
these contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of fhlb stock in the future 
a reduction in value of american federal s fhlb stock may result in a corresponding reduction in american federal s capital 
federal reserve system 
the federal reserve system requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their checking  now  and non personal time deposits 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve system may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements 
savings institutions have authority to borrow from the federal reserve system discount window 
american federal maintains a primary credit facility at the federal reserve s discount window 
insurance of deposit accounts 
deposit accounts at american federal are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation  generally up to a maximum of  per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of  for self directed retirement accounts 
american federal s deposits  therefore  are subject to federal deposit insurance corporation deposit insurance assessments 
assessments paid to the fdic by american federal and other banking institutions are used to fund the fdic s federal deposit insurance fund dif 
insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic 
as insurer of deposits in banks  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by fdic insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the fund 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions  after giving the office of the comptroller of the currency an opportunity to take such action 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement with the fdic 
we are not aware of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to the termination of american federal s deposit insurance 
new assessments under dodd frank 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories 
as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic adopted rules effective april   under which insurance premium assessments are based on an institution total assets minus its tangible equity defined as tier i capital instead of its deposits 
under these rules  an institution with total assets of less than billion is assigned to a risk category and a range of initial base assessment rates applies to each category  subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and  except for an institution in risk category i  adjustment upward if the institution brokered deposits exceed of its domestic deposits  to produce total base assessment rates 
effective april   total base assessment rates will range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv  all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another fdc insured institution 
the fdic may increase or decrease its rates for each quarter by basis points without further rulemaking 
in an emergency  the fdic may also impose a special assessment 
minimum reserve ratios 
the dodd frank act establishes as the minimum reserve ratio for the dif 
the fdic has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by september   the deadline imposed by the dodd frank act  the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to from the former statutory minimum of 
the fdic has not yet announced how it will implement this offset 
in addition to the statutory minimum ratio  the fdic must designate a reserve ratio  known as the designated reserve ratio  or drr  which may exceed the statutory minimum 
the fdic has established as the drr 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
there can be no prediction as to what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  through  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly and as of the quarter ended march  was basis points of assessable deposits 
capital requirements 
federally insured savings institutions  such as american federal  are required by the office of the comptroller of the currency to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
these minimum capital standards include a tangible capital to total assets ratio  a leverage ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camels examination rating system and an risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the prompt corrective action standards  discussed below  also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a leverage ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camels system and  together with the risk based capital standard itself  a tier risk based capital standard 
the regulations also require that  in meeting the tangible  leverage and risk based capital standards  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank 
the risk based capital standard requires federal savings institutions to maintain tier core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  recourse obligations  residual interests and direct credit substitutes  are multiplied by a risk weight factor of to  assigned by the comptroller of the currency capital regulation based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset 
tier core capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock  the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of core capital 
the comptroller of the currency also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements for financial institutions 
on june   the office of the comptroller of the currency and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules to revise their risk based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee on banking supervision in basel iii a global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems basel iii 
the proposed rules would apply to all depository institutions  top tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and top tier savings and loan holding companies banking organizations 
among other things  the proposed rules establish a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier capital requirement  and assign higher risk weightings to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property 
the proposed rules also limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of a specified amount of common equity tier capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
adoption of the final rules has been delayed by the federal bank regulatory agencies based upon the volume of comments received on the proposed rules 
prompt corrective action 
federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  the severity of which depends upon the institution s degree of undercapitalization 
generally  an institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of less than  a ratio of tier core capital to risk weighted assets of less than  or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than or less for institutions with the highest examination rating is considered to be undercapitalized 
an institution that has a total risk based capital ratio less than  a tier capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio that is less than is considered to be significantly undercapitalized and an institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
subject to a narrow exception  the comptroller of the currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is critically undercapitalized 
regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the comptroller of the currency within days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution  including  but not limited to  increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth  capital distributions and expansion 
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions 
the comptroller of the currency also could take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
at june   american federal s capital ratios met the well capitalized standards 
limitations on capital distributions 
federal banking regulations impose various restrictions on institutions with respect to their ability to make distributions of capital  which include dividends  stock redemptions or repurchases  cash out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account 
generally  savings institutions  such as american federal  that before and after the proposed distribution are well capitalized  may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to of net income for the year to date plus retained net income for the two preceding years 
however  an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision may have its dividend authority restricted 
generally  savings institutions proposing to make any capital distribution need not submit written notice to the comptroller of the currency prior to such distribution unless they are a subsidiary of a holding company or would not remain well capitalized following the distribution 
savings institutions that do not  or would not meet their current minimum capital requirements following a proposed capital distribution or propose to exceed these net income limitations  must obtain approval from the comptroller of the currency prior to making such distribution 
the comptroller of the currency may object to the distribution during that day period based on safety and soundness concerns 
qualified thrift lender test 
all savings institutions  including american federal  are required to meet a qualified thrift lender qtl test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations 
this test requires a savings institution to have at least of its total assets  as defined by regulation  in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every months on a rolling basis 
as an alternative  the savings institution may maintain of its assets in those assets specified in section a of the internal revenue code code 
under either test  such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments 
a savings institution that fails to meet the qtl is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter 
the dodd frank act made noncompliance with the qtl test also subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law 
as of june   american federal met the qualified thrift lender test 
activities of associations and their subsidiaries 
when a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the association controls  the savings institution must file a notice or application with the fdic and of the comptroller of the currency at least days in advance and receive regulatory approval or non objection 
savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders 
the comptroller of the currency may determine that the continuation by a savings institution of its ownership control of  or its relationship to  the subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety  soundness or stability of the association or is inconsistent with sound banking practices or with the purposes of the fdic 
based upon that determination  the fdic or the comptroller of the currency has the authority to order the savings institution to divest itself of control of the subsidiary 
the fdic also may determine by regulation or order that any specific activity poses a serious threat to the deposit insurance fund 
if so  it may require that no fdic insured institution engage in that activity directly 
transactions with affiliates 
american federal s authority to engage in transactions with affiliates is limited by regulations and by sections a and b of the federal reserve act as implemented by the federal reserve board s regulation w 
the term affiliates for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution 
eagle is an affiliate of american federal 
in general  transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
in addition  certain types of transactions  ie covered transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution s capital 
collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution 
in addition  savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
our authority to extend credit to executive officers  directors and or greater shareholders insiders  as well as entities controlled by these persons  is governed by sections g and h of the federal reserve act and its implementing regulation  federal reserve board regulation o 
among other things  loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment 
there is an exception for bank wide lending programs that do not discriminate in favor of insiders 
regulation o also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans that may be made to insiders based  in part  on the institution s capital position  and requires that certain prior board approval procedures be followed 
extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made 
at june   we were in compliance with these regulations 
holding company regulation general 
eagle is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulatory oversight of the federal reserve board which became the principal federal bank regulatory agency for eagle during the previous fiscal year 
eagle is required to register and file reports with federal reserve board and is subject to regulation and examination by the federal reserve board 
in addition  the federal reserve board has enforcement authority over eagle and its non savings institution subsidiaries which also permits the federal reserve board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution 
activities restrictions 
the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of  or glba  provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after may  unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below 
upon any non supervisory acquisition by eagle of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  eagle would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to activities permitted multiple holding companies by the comptroller of the currency regulation 
the comptroller of the currency has issued an interpretation concluding that multiple savings and loan holding companies may also engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies  including lending  trust services  insurance activities and underwriting  investment banking and real estate investments 
mergers and acquisitions 
eagle must obtain approval from the federal reserve board before acquiring more than of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger  consolidation or purchase of its assets 
in evaluating an application for eagle to acquire control of a savings institution  the federal reserve board would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of eagle and the target institution  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance fund  the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors 
acquisition of eagle 
under the savings and loan holding company act and the change in bank control act  a notice or application must be submitted to the comptroller of the currency if any person including a company  or a group acting in concert  seeks to acquire or more of eagle s outstanding voting stock  unless the comptroller of the currency has found that the acquisition will not result in a change in control of eagle 
in acting on such a notice or application  the comptroller of the currency must take into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti trust effect of the acquisition 
any company that acquires control will be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company

as directed by the sarbanes oxley act  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact 
the rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission under the sarbanes oxley act have several requirements  including having these officers certify that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting  and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting 
item a 
risk factors we may not successfully integrate the assets  operations and customers of sterling in a manner which proves profitable in the near term 
although we believe we have carefully evaluated the acquisition of the seven branches of sterling bank  we may not be able to achieve reasonable returns on our investment as quickly as we desire or at projected levels 
in addition  although we have made every effort to ensure that our new customers who were formerly customers of sterling continue banking relationships with us  we may not be able to retain all of these customers 
we also may have acquired loans which  despite current levels of acceptable performance  may not continue to perform in this manner in the future 
further  the assumption of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  which resulted in a level of growth significantly greater than we have been historically able to achieve through organic means  may provide challenges in the areas of compliance and risk management that will require additional staff or outside advisors which could increase operating expense 
we hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future 
if these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future  our earnings and the book values of these assets would decrease 
as a result of the branch acquisition from sterling bank  we recorded goodwill in the amount of million 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment on a periodic basis 
the impairment testing process considers a variety of factors  including the current market price of our common shares  the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions 
it is possible that future impairment testing could result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill 
if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period  our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment 
risks associated with system failures  interruptions  or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings 
information technology systems are critical to our business 
we use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships  general ledger  securities  deposits  and loans 
we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures  interruptions  and security breaches  but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur 
in addition  any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services 
although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data  these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security 
in addition  we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third party providers 
if these third party providers encounter difficulties  or if we have difficulty communicating with them  our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected  and our business operations could be adversely affected 
threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel 
the occurrence of any system failures  interruption  or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the structure of fannie mae and freddie mac gses and the relationship among the gses  the federal government and the private markets  or the conversion of the current conservatorship of the gses into receivership  could result in significant changes to our securities portfolio 
the gses are currently in conservatorship  with their primary regulator  the federal housing finance agency  acting as conservator 
we cannot predict if  when or how the conservatorships will end  or any associated changes to the gses business structure that could result 
we also cannot predict whether the conservatorships will end in receivership 
there are several proposed approaches  including possible legislative changes in discussion in both the house financial services committee and the senate banking committee which  if enacted  could change the nature of government participation in the private mortgage market or alternatively the structure of the gses  the relationship among the gses  the government and the private markets  including the trading markets for agency conforming mortgage loans and markets for mortgage related securities in which we participate 
we cannot predict the prospects for the enactment  timing or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of any of these approaches 
accordingly  there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the gses  including whether they will continue to exist in their current form 
gse reform  if enacted  could result in a significant change and adversely impact our business operations 
we cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economic downturn on our future results of operations or market price of our stock 
the national economy and the financial services sector  while improving somewhat  continue to face challenges 
we cannot accurately predict the severity of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted the markets we serve or whether improving conditions signal near term end to such conditions 
any renewed deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect  which could be material  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects  and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline 
a slow or fragile recovery or another recession could continue to present risks for some time for the financial services industry and our company 
if the allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms  and the collateral  if any  securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
we may experience significant loan losses  which may have a material adverse effect on operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans 
if the assumptions prove to be incorrect  the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance 
material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income 
our emphasis on the origination of consumer  commercial real estate and commercial business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses 
as we continue to increase the amount of such loans  additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary and would decrease earnings 
bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we could record future losses on our securities portfolio 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss exists with respect to our investment securities portfolio that constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary  which could result in material losses to us 
these factors include  but are not limited to  continued failure by the issuer to make scheduled interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers deteriorates and there is limited liquidity for these securities 
changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial results and condition 
some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results 
some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
if such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect  we may experience material losses 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes are beyond our control  can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition 
we could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 
a prolonged economic downturn  especially one affecting our geographic market area  will adversely affect our business and financial results 
the united states and many industrial nations are experiencing adverse economic conditions and slow recovery which are expected to continue in loan portfolio quality has improved at many institutions  reflecting in part  the improving us economy and rising employment 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages appear to have stabilized but may continue to decline 
the continuing stagnation in the real estate market also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction  residential and commercial mortgage loans 
financial institution stock prices have declined substantially  and it is significantly more difficult for financial institutions to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets 
continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
moreover  continued volatility or declines in the stock market in general  or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies  could adversely affect our stock performance 
as a federal savings bank  american federal savings bank is required to maintain a certain percentage of its total assets in qualifying loans and investments  which limits our asset mix and could significantly restrict our ability to diversify our loan portfolio 
a savings bank or thrift differs from a commercial bank in that it is required to maintain at least of its total assets in housing related loans and investments  such as loans for the purchase  refinance  construction  improvement  or repair of residential real estate  home equity loans  educational loans and small business loans 
to maintain our thrift charter we have to pass the qualified thrift lender test  or qtl test  in nine out of of the immediately preceding months 
the qtl test limits the extent to which we can grow our commercial loan portfolio 
however  a loan that does not exceed million including a group of loans to one borrower and is for commercial  corporate  business  or agricultural purposes is not so limited 
we may be limited in our ability to change our asset mix and increase the yield on our earning assets by growing our commercial loan portfolio 
in addition  if we continue to grow our commercial loan portfolio and our single family loan portfolio declines  it is possible that in order to maintain our qtl status  we could be forced to buy mortgage backed securities or other qualifying assets at times when the terms might not be attractive 
alternatively  we could find it necessary to pursue different structures  including converting american federal savings bank s current thrift charter to a commercial bank charter 
because we intend to increase our commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations  our credit risk will increase and continued downturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect our earnings 
we intend to continue our recent emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one to four family residential real estate loans we originate 
because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses  repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
a downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower s business  thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans 
as our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios increase  the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase 
declines in home values could decrease our loan originations and increase delinquencies and defaults 
declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations 
like all financial institutions  we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn  and in particular  a significant decline in home values would likely lead to a decrease in new home equity loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios 
declines in the average sale prices of homes in our primary markets could lead to higher loan losses 
we depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team 
we also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas 
the departure of any member of our senior management team may adversely affect our operations 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits  borrowings and trust preferred securities 
because our interest bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income 
changes in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
also  increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets  which would restrict our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives  and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates 
changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
strong competition may limit growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the federal banking laws and regulations govern the activities in which we may engage  and are primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund at the federal deposit insurance corporation 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank s operations  reclassify assets  determine the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change 
any new laws  rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
financial reform legislation enacted by congress will  among other things  tighten capital standards  create a new consumer financial protection bureau and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act in july this new law has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act are expected to have a near term impact on us 
effective july   the dodd frank act eliminated the federal prohibitions against paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
so far this impact has been minimal  however  we suspect it will change once the current low interest rate environment changes 
the dodd frank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
savings institutions such as american federal savings bank with billion or less in assets will continued to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators 
the federal reserve board is required to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital are required to be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
there is a five year transition period from the july  effective date of the dodd frank act before the capital requirements will apply to savings and loan holding companies 
it is difficult to predict at this time what impact the dodd frank act and its implementing rules will have on community banks like american federal 
however  it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of seattle becomes impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease 
we are required to own common stock of the federal home loan bank of seattle to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the federal home loan bank s advance program 
the aggregate cost of our federal home loan bank common stock as of june  was million 
federal home loan bank common stock is not a marketable security and can only be redeemed by the federal home loan bank 
federal home loan banks may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their regulatory capital 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the federal home loan bank of seattle  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  we believe that there is a risk that our investment in federal home loan bank of seattle common stock could be deemed impaired at some time in the future  and if this occurs  it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the amount of the impairment charge 
future legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our ability to foreclose on collateral 
there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
were proposals such as these  or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor  to be adopted  we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor

item selected financial data 
this item has been omitted based on eagle s status as a smaller reporting company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of eagle is intended to help investors understand our company and our operations 
the financial review is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview historically  our principal business has consisted of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans secured by various types of collateral  including real estate and other consumer assets 
we are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions  particularly interest rates  as well as government policies concerning  among other things  monetary and fiscal affairs  housing and financial institutions and regulations regarding lending and other operations  privacy and consumer disclosure 
attracting and maintaining deposits is influenced by a number of factors  including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non financial institutions  account maturities  fee structures  and levels of personal income and savings 
lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates  the number and quality of lenders and regional economic conditions 
sources of funds for lending activities include deposits  borrowings  repayments on loans  cash flows from maturities of investment securities and income provided from operations 
our earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits  borrowed funds  and trust preferred securities 
net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balance of interest earning assets compared to interest bearing liabilities 
also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income  which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services  net gains and losses on sale of assets  and mortgage loan service fees 
net interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for loan losses  general administrative and other expenses  including salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs  as well as by state and federal income tax expense 
american federal savings bank has a strong mortgage lending focus  with the majority of its loan originations in single family residential mortgages  which has enabled it to successfully market home equity loans  as well as a wide range of shorter term consumer loans for various personal needs automobiles  recreational vehicles  etc in recent years we have also focused on adding commercial loans to our portfolio  both real estate and non real estate 
we have made significant progress in this initiative 
as of june   commercial real estate and land loans and commercial business loans represented and of the total loan portfolio  respectively 
the purpose of this diversification is to mitigate our dependence on the mortgage market  as well as to improve our ability to manage our interest rate spread 
with the acquisition of the sterling bank branches  the investment portfolio grew substantially during the current fiscal year 
as such  management is also focused on decreasing the investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets and offset this with growth in the loan portfolio 
american federal savings bank s management recognizes that fee income will also enable it to be less dependent on specialized lending and it now maintains a significant loan serviced portfolio  which provides a steady source of fee income 
as of june   we had mortgage servicing rights  net of million compared to million as of june  the gain on sale of loans also provides significant fee income in periods of high mortgage loan origination volumes 
fee income is also supplemented with fees generated from our deposit accounts 
american federal savings bank has a high percentage of non maturity deposits  such as checking accounts and savings accounts  which allows management flexibility in managing its spread 
non maturity deposits do not automatically reprice as interest rates rise  as do certificates of deposit 
for the past three years  management s focus has been on improving our core earnings 
core earnings can be described as income before taxes  with the exclusion of gain on sale of loans and adjustments to the market value of our loans serviced portfolio 
management believes that we will need to continue to focus on increasing net interest margin  other areas of fee income  and control operating expenses to achieve earnings growth going forward 
management s strategy of growing the loan portfolio and deposit base is expected to help achieve these goals loans typically earn higher rates of return than investments  a larger deposit base will yield higher fee income  increasing the asset base will reduce the relative impact of fixed operating costs 
the biggest challenge to management s strategy is funding the growth of our balance sheet in an efficient manner 
though deposit growth this last year was robust  it may become more difficult to maintain due to significant competition and possible reduced customer demand for deposits as customers may shift into other asset classes 
other than in limited circumstances for certain high credit quality customers  we do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties where the borrower pays interest but no principal for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan 
we also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we do not offer subprime loans loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies  previous charge offs  judgments  bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt burden ratios or alt a loans traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
the level and movement of interest rates impacts the bank s earnings as well 
for the fiscal year the short end of the yield curve was fairly static as the federal open market committee maintained the fed funds rate at a target of to basis points while the long end of the curve moved upward 
from time to time the bank has considered growth through mergers or acquisition as an alternative to its strategy of organic growth 
in this connection  on june   the bank entered into a definitive agreement with sterling savings bank  a washington state chartered bank  to acquire sterling s banking operations in the state of montana  including seven branch locations  certain deposit liabilities  loans and other assets and liabilities associated with such branch locations 
as a result of this acquisition  which closed on november   the bank acquired approximately million in additional assets  including approximately million of pass rated performing loans and assumed million in new deposits 
the bank expects that the increase in its branch network as a result of the sterling branch acquisition will substantially increase its loan origination volume and  due to the substantial increase in deposits  fee income 
in addition  the acquisition of the branches is expected to increase certain of the bank s expenses  including salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment expense 
the bank received approximately million in cash in the transaction  which may not be able to be immediately used to fund loans 
while a substantial amount of the cash has been invested in securities  it may require additional time to deploy all of the proceeds to fund loans 
the company anticipates that the sterling acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first year after the acquisition 
however  the size of the acquisition may cause integration challenges that could delay or reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition 
the branch acquisition complements the bank s existing growth strategy by expanding into the southern montana market and more than doubling the bank s retail branch network from six to locations 
of the seven acquired branches six are in new markets for the bank  including two in missoula  one in billings  and one each in hamilton  livingston and big timber 
the seventh is in bozeman where the bank already has a presence 
after the acquisition  the bank became the sixth largest montana based banking institution 
in addition  the transaction also strengthens the bank s mortgage origination franchise and adds a wealth management business headquartered in bozeman  montana 
the addition of sterling s montana mortgage banking unit will double the bank s mortgage banking business 
this increase in the mortgage banking business and the addition of a wealth management business is expected to increase the bank s noninterest income and further the bank s strategy to increase fee income to complement its margin 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for us in fiscal and earlier adoption is permitted 
upon completion of the acquisition branches from another bank the company has recorded goodwill and has adopted the provisions of this pronouncement 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update require entities to report significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for all other amounts an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about these amounts 
the amendments are effective during the interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company adopted this guidance and it did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the understanding of our financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
the following are the accounting policies we believe are critical 
allowance for loan losses 
we recognize that losses will be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan  the creditworthiness of the borrower  general economic conditions and the quality of the collateral for the loan 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses based on all available information 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio  including past loan loss experience  known and inherent losses  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  and current economic conditions 
the loan portfolio and other credit exposures are regularly reviewed by management in its determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes a review of historical losses  internal data including delinquencies among others  industry data  and economic conditions 
as an integral part of their examination process  the office of the comptroller of the currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  loss factors are applied to various pools of outstanding loans 
loss factors are derived using our historical loss experience and may be adjusted for factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
commercial business loans that are criticized are evaluated individually to determine the required allowance for loan losses and to evaluate the potential impairment of such loans under fasb asc receivables 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed previously 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the allowance is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
valuation of investment securities 
substantially all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at current fair value 
unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred taxes  are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in general  fair value is based upon quoted market prices of identical assets  when available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is based upon valuation models that use cash flow  security structure and other observable information 
where sufficient data is not available to produce a fair valuation  fair value is based on broker quotes for similar assets 
broker quotes may be adjusted to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value 
adjustments may include unobservable parameters  among other things 
no adjustments were made to any broker quotes received by us 
we conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of our investment securities to determine if any declines in fair value are other than temporary 
in making this determination  we consider the period of time the securities were in a loss position  the percentage decline in comparison to the securities amortized cost  the financial condition of the issuer  if applicable  and the delinquency or default rates of underlying collateral 
we consider our intent to sell the investment securities and the likelihood that we will not have to sell the investment securities before recovery of their cost basis 
if impairment exists  credit related impairment losses are recorded in earnings while noncredit related impairment losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in fasb asc income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on an ongoing basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a reduction in estimated future taxable income could require us to record a valuation allowance 
changes in levels of valuation allowances could result in increased income tax expense  and could negatively affect earnings 
financial condition introduction 
growth in a number of the categories referenced herein was significantly impacted by the acquisition of the sterling bank branches in november of total assets increased million  or  to million at june   from million at june  total liabilities increased by million  or  to million at june   from million at june  the loan portfolio increased million during the year 
total deposits increased million 
noninterest checking increased million or  to million at june   and money market accounts increased  or 
interest bearing checking accounts increased million  or  to million at june  certificates of deposits increased million  or  to million at june  all of these increases were principally from the acquisition of the sterling bank branches previously noted 
balance sheet details 
loans receivable increased million  or to million from million 
though loan originations were relatively strong  much of the loan origination volume was in and year fixed rate one to four family residential mortgages which were primarily sold in the secondary market 
we sold million in loans during fiscal year  an increase of million from million sold in fiscal year the amount of loans sold in fiscal year was exceptionally high  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year  as the bank had fully integrated the mortgage lending operations of the sterling bank montana home loan operations 
likewise significant refinance volume of one to four family residential mortgages continued due to the historical low mortgage interest rates 
origination activity in all loan categories  increased in the current fiscal year 
commercial real estate and land loan originations increased million during the year  and residential mortgage loan originations increased million 
the available for sale investment portfolio increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  the investment category with the largest increase was municipal securities  which increased million 
premises and equipment increased million  which was primarily due to the purchase of the sterling bank montana branches as noted previously 
this was partially offset by depreciation expense 
total deposits increased by million  notwithstanding lower rates on deposits 
the growth was attributable to the acquisition of the sterling bank montana branches and consumers seeking additional safety and protection afforded by increased federal deposit insurance 
of that increase  certificates of deposit increased million  to million at june  from million at june  the bank had no brokered deposits as of june  interest earning checking accounts increased million and noninterest checking increased million 
money market accounts increased million and savings accounts increased million 
in addition to the sterling bank montana branch acquisition  a portion of the deposit growth the bank has experienced over the last three fiscal years has likely been the result of investor interest in principal protection during the financial crisis and ensuing economic downturn 
as such  as the financial crisis subsides  we believe deposit growth could be more difficult to achieve on a long term basis due to significant competition among financial institutions in our markets 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings decreased to million at year end from million at year end  a decrease of million and is largely attributable to the availability of retail funding from deposits 
total shareholders equity was million at june   a decrease of million over the comparable period

analysis of net interest income the bank s earnings have historically depended primarily upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and any borrowed funds 
it is the single largest component of eagle s operating income 
net interest income is affected by i the difference between rates of interest earned on loans and investments and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings the interest rate spread and ii the relative amounts of loans and investments and interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the following tables set forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information at and for the periods indicated 
all average balances are daily average balances 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield

net interest margin represents income before the provision for loan losses divided by average interest earning assets 
for purposes of this table  tax exempt income is not calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume multiplied by the old rate  changes in rate  which are changes in rate multiplied by the old volume  and changes not solely attributable to rate or volume  which have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

net interest income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the previous year 
this increase of million  or  was the result of a decrease in interest expense of  and an increase in interest income of  as shown in the rate volume analysis  this increase was mainly attributable to a decrease in average balances in borrowings  larger average balances of deposits and lower rates on deposits largely offset by lower rates on interest earning assets

the average rate paid on borrowings decreased to in from in provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to maintain the total allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate by the bank to provide for probable loan losses based on prior loss experience  volume and type of lending we conduct and past due loans in portfolio 
the bank s policies require the review of assets on a quarterly basis 
the bank classifies loans as well as other assets if warranted 
while management believes it uses the best information available to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  it recognizes that future adjustments may be necessary 
using this methodology  a provision to increase the allowance for loan loss by  was made for the year ended june  while a provision of million was made for the year ended june  this  management believes  adequately reflected a level of total allowances considered adequate 
total classified assets decreased to million at june  from million at june  total nonperforming loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio decreased to at june   from at june  as of june   american federal savings bank had   net of allowance for valuation losses of  in other real estate owned  a decrease of million from the million held at june  noninterest income

gain on sale of available for sale securities increased  other noninterest income increased  to million  which primarily was from increased balances in bank owned life insurance 
the single largest item in other noninterest income is earnings from bank owned life insurance of noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by million or to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with operating a larger organization resulting from the acquisition of the sterling bank montana branches discussed earlier 
acquisition costs of million were incurred this fiscal year and also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense compared to the prior year 
consulting fees did decrease  due to costs associated with a potential acquisition that was examined during the prior fiscal year but did not come to fruition 
income tax expense 
eagle s income tax expense was a benefit of  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  the effective tax rate was negative for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  as pretax income was lowered by acquisition costs and higher employee costs  the percent of tax free municipal bond income and bank owned life insurance income to total income became significant 
likewise  the deductibility of goodwill for tax purposes caused the company to experience a negative effective tax rate which was furthered by its new markets tax credits first taken during the second quarter of fiscal year the company has equity investments in certified development entities which have received allocations of new markets tax credits nmtc 
administered by the community development financial institutions fund of the us department of the treasury  the nmtc program is aimed at stimulating economic and community development and job creation in low income communities 
the federal income tax credits received are claimed over a seven year credit allowance period 
the federal tax credit benefits were  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources eagle s subsidiary  american federal savings bank  is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by the office of the comptroller of the currency regulations 
the liquidity requirement is retained for safety and soundness purposes  and that appropriate levels of liquidity will depend upon the types of activities in which the company engages 
for internal reporting purposes  the bank uses policy minimums of  and for basic surplus and basic surplus with fhlb as internally defined 
in general  the basic surplus is a calculation of the ratio of unencumbered short term assets reduced by estimated percentages of cd maturities and other deposits that may leave the bank in the next days divided by total assets 
basic surplus with fhlb adds to basic surplus the additional borrowing capacity the bank has with the fhlb of seattle 
the bank exceeded those minimum ratios as of both june  and june  the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations  advances from the fhlb of seattle and other borrowings 
scheduled repayments of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturities of investment securities are generally predictable 
however  other sources of funds  such as deposit flows and loan prepayments  can be greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank uses liquidity resources principally to fund existing and future loan commitments 
it also uses them to fund maturing certificates of deposit  demand deposit withdrawals and to invest in other loans and investments  maintain liquidity  and meet operating expenses 
net cash used by the company s operating activities  which is primarily comprised of cash transactions affecting net income  was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the change was primarily a result of an increase in the amount of loans held for sale in net cash provided used in the company s investing activities  which is primarily comprised of cash transactions from the investment securities and mortgage backed securities portfolios and the loan portfolio  was million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the decrease in cash provided was primarily due to purchases of available for sale securities in compared to net cash provided used by the company s financing activities was million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the increase in cash was primarily a result of net increases in deposits 
liquidity may be adversely affected by unexpected deposit outflows  higher interest rates paid by competitors  and similar matters 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the level desirable based in part on eagle s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of eagle s ability to generate funds 
at may  the most recent report available  the bank s measure of sensitivity to interest rate movements  as measured internally  decreased slightly from the previous quarter 
the market value of the bank s capital position has increased modestly from the previous year due to net income offset by the payment of dividends and the repurchase of company stock 
the bank is well within the guidelines set forth by the board of directors for interest rate sensitivity 
as of june   the bank s regulatory capital was in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements and the bank is deemed well capitalized pursuant to occ rules 
at june   the bank s tangible  core  and risk based capital ratios amounted to   and  respectively  compared to regulatory requirements of   and  respectively 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which are found in item  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
interest rate risk analysis in addition to the asset liability committee  the board of directors reviews our asset and liability policies 
the board of directors reviews interest rate risk and interest rate trends quarterly  as well as liquidity and capital ratio requirements 
management administers the policies and determinations of the board of directors with respect to our asset and liability goals and strategies 
our asset and liability policy and strategies are expected to continue as described so long as competitive and regulatory conditions in the financial institution industry and market interest rates continue as they have in recent years 
the following table discloses how the bank s economic value of equity eve would react to interest rate changes 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an eve calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
changes in market interest rates basis points economic value of equity as of pv of assets at june  projected eve board policy limit if applicable must be no greater than off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we use mandatory sell forward delivery commitments to sell whole loans to the secondary markets 
these commitments are also used as a hedge against exposure to interest rate risks relating from rate locked loan origination commitments on certain mortgage loans held for sale
