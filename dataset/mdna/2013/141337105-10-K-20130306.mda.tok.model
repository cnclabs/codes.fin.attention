item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates  and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of cloud backup solutions for consumers and smbs 
we provide easy to use  affordable  and secure cloud backup solutions with anytime  anywhere access to files stored on our servers 
we believe that we are the best known brand in the cloud backup market 
in  we began development of our cloud backup solution and raised our first capital from investors 
we sold the first carbonite subscription in in  we introduced our smb solution and expanded our management team to better focus on our consumer and smb markets 
we surpassed  subscribers in   subscribers in  and  subscribers in early as of december   we had subscribers in more than countries  with subscribers based in the us representing of our total revenue for we derive our revenue from subscription fees from consumers and smbs 
we charge consumers a flat fee for one year of unlimited cloud backup with our carbonite home solution 
our carbonite homeplus and carbonite homepremier solutions provide consumers with additional features at annual prices of and  respectively 
the pricing of all of our consumer solutions is discounted for multi year subscriptions 
our smb solutions  carbonite business and carbonite businesspremier  allow for an unlimited number of users  subject to storage limits  and are priced starting at and per year  respectively 
we charge customers the full subscription amount at the beginning of each subscription period 
we initially record a subscription fee as deferred revenue and then recognize it ratably over the subscription period 
the annual or multi year commitments of our customers enhance management s visibility of our revenue and charging customers at the beginning of the subscription period provides working capital 
in october  we acquired zmanda  inc for million  net of cash acquired 
we believe that this acquisition will enhance our smb offering with the ability to backup databases and file systems to the cloud  and will enable smb s to obtain all of the backup solutions that they need from one vendor 
we are investing aggressively in customer acquisition because we believe that the market for cloud backup is in the early stages of development 
our largest expense is advertising for customer acquisition  which is recorded as sales and marketing expense 
this is comprised of television and radio advertising  online display advertising  print advertising  paid search  direct marketing  and other expenses 
our total advertising expense in   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
we generally spend more on advertising in the first and third quarters of each year based on the seasonality of customer purchasing patterns and fluctuations in advertising rates 
in january  we launched a new distribution strategy designed to sell large volumes of our solutions through our sales channel relationships including major retailers and resellers 
as we grow our business we continue to invest in additional storage and infrastructure 
our capital expenditures in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
our revenue has grown from million in to million in and million in at the same time  our total operating costs have grown from million in to million in and 
table of contents million in  principally as a result of our investment in customer acquisition and research and development 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to customer acquisition  improving our technologies  and expanding our solutions 
in addition  we expect to invest heavily in our operations to support anticipated growth and public company reporting and compliance obligations 
we defer revenue over our customers subscription periods  but expense marketing costs as incurred 
as a result of these factors  we expect to continue to incur gaap operating losses on an annual basis for the foreseeable future 
our business model we evaluate the profitability of a customer relationship over its lifecycle because of the nature of our business model 
as we generally incur customer acquisition costs and capital equipment costs in advance of subscriptions while recognizing revenue ratably over the terms of the subscriptions 
as a result  a customer relationship may not be profitable or result in positive cash flow at the beginning of the subscription period  even though it may be profitable or result in positive cash flow over the life of the customer relationship 
while we offer both annual and multi year subscription plans  a significant majority of our customers are currently on annual subscription plans 
we typically generate positive cash flow during the first year of a multi year subscription as we charge the subscription fee for the entire period at the beginning of the subscription 
key business metrics our management regularly reviews a number of financial and operating metrics  including the following key metrics  to evaluate our business total customers 
we calculate total customers as the number of paid carbonite home and business subscriptions at the end of the relevant period 
each consumer subscription covers a single computer  therefore  a consumer with multiple computers would have multiple subscriptions 
each smb subscription covers all computers of the smb entity  therefore  an smb with multiple computers would have one subscription 
annual retention rate 
we calculate annual retention rate as the percentage of customers on the last day of the prior year who remain customers on the last day of the current year  or for quarterly presentations  the percentage of customers on the last day of the comparable quarter in the prior year who remain customers on the last day of the current quarter 
our management uses these measures to determine the stability of our customer base and to evaluate the lifetime value of our customer relationships 
renewal rate 
we define renewal rate for a period as the percentage of customers who renew annual or multi year subscriptions that expire during the period presented 
renewal rate excludes customers under our discontinued third party distribution agreements and prior smb offerings with subscriptions that remain active until cancelled 
our management uses this measure to monitor trends in customer renewal activity 
bookings 
we calculate bookings as revenue recognized during a particular period plus the change in total deferred revenue excluding deferred revenue recorded in connection with acquisitions during the same period 
our management uses this measure as a proxy for cash receipts 
bookings represent the aggregate dollar value of customer subscriptions received by us during a period 
we initially record a subscription fee as deferred revenue and then recognize it ratably  on a daily basis  over the life of the subscription period 
free cash flow 
we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by used in operating activities  less purchases of property and equipment  and adjusted for the cash portion of the lease exit charge 
our management uses this measure to evaluate our operating results 

table of contents subscription renewals may vary during the year based on the date of our customers original subscriptions 
as we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period  this generally has not resulted in a material seasonal impact on our revenue  but may result in material monthly and quarterly variances in one or more of the key business metrics described above 
performance highlights the following table presents our performance highlights for the periods presented years ended december  in thousands  except percentage data key metrics total customers annual retention rate renewal rate bookings free cash flow our total customers and bookings increased over the periods presented and we continue to invest in customer acquisition in an effort to drive continued growth in total customers and bookings 
while we expect our total customers to continue to increase on an absolute basis  we expect that our annual percentage increase in total customers will decline as our customer base grows 
in june  we decided to cease distribution of our consumer solutions through third party distribution channels  and we terminated most of our distribution agreements at that time 
during  subscriptions purchased through third party distributors accounted for of our revenue 
historically  renewal rates for subscriptions purchased through third party distributors were lower than for direct sales 
excluding renewal activity related to third party distributor sales  our annual retention rates for the years ended december   december   and december  were   and respectively 
our free cash flow over the periods presented has improved due to economies of scale and the impact of higher per customer profitability associated with consistently strong renewal rates 
free cash flow for the year ended december  improved by million and million compared to the years ended december  and december   respectively 
key components of our consolidated statements of operations revenue we derive our revenue from subscription fees from consumers and smbs 
we typically charge a customer s credit card the full price of the subscription at the commencement of the subscription period and at each renewal date  unless the customer decides not to renew the subscription 
we initially record a customer subscription fee as deferred revenue and then recognize it ratably  on a daily basis  over the life of the subscription period 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with our data center operations and customer support centers  including wages and benefits for personnel  depreciation of equipment  amortization of developed technology  rent  utilities and broadband  equipment maintenance  software license fees  and allocated overhead 
the expenses related to hosting our services and supporting our customers are related to the number of customers and the complexity of our services and hosting infrastructure 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute 
table of contents dollars as we continue to increase our number of customers 
on a per subscriber basis  our costs have been decreasing as we purchase equipment and services in larger quantities and our customer support personnel become more efficient in supporting our customers 
we have also experienced a downward trend in the cost of storage equipment and broadband service  which we expect will continue in the future 
gross profit and gross margin our gross margins have historically expanded due to price increases for our consumer solutions  the introduction of higher priced offerings targeting both consumers and smbs  cost savings resulting from a downward trend in the cost of storage equipment and services  and efficiencies of our customer support personnel in supporting our customers 
we expect these trends to continue 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for development personnel  consulting fees  rent  and depreciation 
we have focused our research and development efforts on both improving ease of use and functionality of our existing solutions and developing new offerings 
the majority of our research and development employees are located at our corporate headquarters in the us we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars on an annual basis as we continue to enhance and expand our services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative personnel  legal and accounting fees  insurance  and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars on an annual basis as we continue to add personnel and enhance our internal information systems in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  creative expenses for advertising programs  credit card fees  commissions paid to third party partners and affiliates  and the cost of providing free trials 
the largest component of sales and marketing expense is advertising for customer acquisition  principally television  radio  online  and print advertisements 
online search costs consist primarily of pay per click payments to search engine operators 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
to date  marketing and advertising costs have been incurred principally in the us  but we may increase our marketing and advertising expenditures in other countries 
we expect that we will continue to commit significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts to grow our business and awareness of our brand and solutions 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars on an annual basis  but decrease as a percentage of revenue 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges consists of the accrual of future remaining lease payments associated with the march closure of our boston  massachusetts data center and moving expenses to relocate equipment formerly hosted in that facility and the december personnel related restructuring of our operations in china 
see notes and to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain 
table of contents and unpredictable 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that other professionals  applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition 
our most critical accounting policies are summarized below 
see note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from cloud backup subscription services 
these services are stand alone independent service solutions  which are generally contracted for a one to three year term 
subscription agreements include access to use our solutions via the internet 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards codification asc  overall revenue recognition 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably on a daily basis upon activation over the subscription period  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists  the subscription period has been activated  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue represents payments received from customers for subscription services prior to recognizing the revenue related to those payments 
business combinations in accordance with asc  business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology  customer relationships  tradenames  and non compete agreements 
developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility and tradenames represent acquired company and product names 
customer relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company s installed base 
non compete agreements represent the protection against the loss of business and resultant cash flows from direct competition 
we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we record goodwill when consideration paid in a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events or circumstances may occur  that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
we perform our assessment for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and we have determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this annual goodwill impairment assessment 
for purposes of assessing potential impairment  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization and compare this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit as reflected by our total stockholders equity 
if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge would be required 
our annual goodwill impairment test is at november of each year 
to date  we have not identified any impairment to goodwill 

table of contents intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits or  if that pattern cannot be readily determined  on a straight line basis 
we review our intangible assets with definite lives for impairment  in conjunction with its other long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any of these assets may not be recoverable 
if the recoverability of these assets is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its estimated fair value 
we have not identified any impairment of its long lived assets as of december    and income taxes we provide for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
we account for uncertain tax positions recognized in our consolidated financial statements by prescribing a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
due to a history of losses  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the ability to utilize these losses  any future losses  and any other tax credits or attributes may be restricted or eliminated by changes in our ownership  changes in legislation  and other rules affecting the ability to offset future taxable income with losses from prior periods 
future determinations on the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will be made on an annual basis  and our assessment at december  reflects a continued need for a full valuation allowance 
stock based compensation accounting guidance requires employee stock based payments to be accounted for under the fair value method 
under this method  we are required to record compensation cost based on the estimated fair value for stock based awards granted amortized over the requisite service periods for the individual awards  which generally equals the vesting periods 
we use the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock based compensation expenses 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards requires the use of highly subjective estimates and assumptions  including the estimated fair value of our common stock 
following our initial public offering  we used the quoted market price of our common stock to establish the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock with input from management  based on reports of an unrelated third party valuation specialist 
we estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which further requires the use of highly subjective estimates and assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of an award  risk free interest rate  and expected dividend yield 
as a public company with limited trading history  we consider both the volatility of our stock price and that of our publicly traded peer companies 
the expected life assumption is based on the simplified method for estimating expected term as we do not have sufficient stock option exercise experience to support a reasonable estimate of the expected term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the stock option 
we use an expected dividend rate of zero as we currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our capital stock

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which primarily consisted of cash and money market funds 
in connection with our initial public offering in august  we received net proceeds of million 
prior to our initial public offering  we had funded our operations primarily through prepayment of subscriptions and the sale of million of preferred stock  all of which was converted into shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering 
our principal uses of cash are funding our operations and capital expenditures 
in june  we used million of cash to acquire substantially all of the assets of phanfare  inc  which operates a service that enables users to create  maintain  and share online photo and video albums 
in october  we used million of cash to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of zmanda  inc  a provider of open source and cloud backup solutions 
sources of funds we believe  based on our current operating plan  that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing sources to develop or enhance our solutions  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures  to acquire or to invest in complementary products  businesses or technologies  or to lower our cost of capital  which could include equity  equity linked  and debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity linked securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences  and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
in september  we amended and renewed our revolving bank credit facility in order to extend the term of the facility through august  and increased the maximum amount of indebtedness that we may incur to million 
advances under the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding daily balance  at an annual rate equal to the lender s prime reference rate plus 
we have pledged our accounts receivable  equipment  and shares of our subsidiaries to the lender to collateralize our obligations under the credit facility 
we have also agreed not to grant a security interest in or pledge our intellectual property to any third party 
the credit facility 
table of contents contains customary events of default  conditions to borrowings and restrictive covenants  including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets  make acquisitions  incur additional debt  incur liens  make distributions to our stockholders  make investments  or enter into certain types of related party transactions 
the credit facility also includes financial and other covenants including covenants to maintain a minimum current ratio  a minimum number of total subscribers  and a restriction as to where we may hold the majority of our cash and investments 
to date  we have not drawn down on our revolving credit facility 
any inability to meet our debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial position and liquidity 
uses of funds we have increased our operating and capital expenditures in connection with the growth in our operations and the increase in our personnel  and we anticipate that we will continue to increase such expenditures in the future 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors  including the levels of advertising and promotion required to acquire and retain customers  expansion of our data center infrastructure necessary to support our growth  growth of our operations in the us and worldwide  our development and introduction of new solutions  and the expansion of our sales  customer support  research and development  and marketing organizations 
consistent with previous periods  future capital expenditures will focus on acquiring additional data storage and hosting capacity and general corporate infrastructure 
we are not currently party to any purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures  other than short term purchase orders 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow data for   and years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the amount of our net loss  growth in subscription sales and customer growth  changes in working capital accounts  the timing of prepayments and payments to vendors  add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation expense 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily driven by a million increase in deferred revenue associated with the increase in subscription sales and customer growth 
net cash inflows from operating activities included non cash charges of million  including million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
these cash inflows were partially offset by our net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets

the commitments under our office lease obligations shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our boston  massachusetts corporate headquarters and our lewiston  maine customer support facility 
we also lease small amounts of general office space in sunnyvale  california  princeton  new jersey  and beijing  china under lease agreements that expire at various dates through march our lewiston  maine support facility lease expires on june  we may terminate this lease at any time after may  the lease contains a renewal option for an additional two years  and requires us to pay a proportion of increases in operating expenses and real estate taxes after january  the commitment under our hosting facility obligations shown above consists of somerville  massachusetts  wakefield  massachusetts  and phoenix  arizona data centers 
other purchase commitments shown above consist of contractual commitments to various vendors primarily for advertising  marketing  and broadband services 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
under this guidance  we can present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we elected to present comprehensive income using two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
as the new guidance relates only to how comprehensive income is disclosed and does not change the items that must be reported as comprehensive income  adoption did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate fluctuation risks and foreign exchange risks 
interest rate fluctuation risk our cash consists of interest bearing bank accounts 
we did not have long term borrowings as of december  interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities are relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
in future periods  we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives 
in the event that we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus  we would be exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our operating expenses and potential revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the chinese yuan 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not have a material impact on our results of operations
