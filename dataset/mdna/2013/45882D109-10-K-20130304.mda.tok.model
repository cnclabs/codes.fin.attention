overview we have pioneered a proprietary approach to accelerate research and development  innovation and time to market for the semiconductor and clean energy industries 
using our approach  we develop technology and intellectual property ip focused on advanced materials  processes  integration and device architectures in collaboration with our customers 
this technology enables our customers to bring optimized  high volume manufacturing ready integrated devices to market faster and with less risk than traditional approaches to research and development r d 
we provide our customers with proprietary technology through various fee arrangements and grant them rights to associated ip  primarily through royalty bearing licenses 
our proprietary approach is broadly applicable to high volume integrated device markets  which include semiconductors  flat glass coatings and glass based devices  solar cells  light emitting diodes leds  flat panel displays  advanced batteries and other energy efficient technologies 
we were founded in and are headquartered in san jose  california 
our total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our net loss decreased to million for the year ended december  from a net loss before accretion on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
table of contents of million for the year ended december  our backlog as of december  was million  of which million is scheduled to be recognized as revenue during and million is scheduled to be recognized as revenue in periods beyond as of december   we had backlog of approximately million  which contributed approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  our net loss in included a mark to market related charge recorded in other income expense  net in the amount of million related to our purchase of intellectual property from symyx 
since inception  we have incurred net losses leading to an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in february  one of our significant customers  elpida  filed for protection under the corporate reorganization act in japan 
this created uncertainty relating to future revenue including amounts in backlog from our collaborative development program cdp with elpida  which runs through march in july  micron technology  inc micron and elpida trustees jointly announced that they signed a definitive sponsor agreement for micron to acquire and support elpida 
on october   the tokyo district court issued an order to refer elpida reorganization plan  which includes the proposed micron acquisition  to elpida creditors for approval 
creditors had until february  to submit their votes 
on february   elpida announced that the reorganization plan was approved by the statutorily required majority of the creditors and was also approved by the tokyo district court 
the transactions  which are subject to certain other conditions  are scheduled to close in the first half of however  there can be no assurance that these transactions will close in a timely manner or at all 
during the year ended december  we recognized million in revenue and recorded bad debt expense related to pre bankruptcy accounts receivable in the amount of million from elpida 
as of december  we had outstanding accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  in the amount of million and had million in backlog from elpida  of which million is scheduled to be recognized as revenue during with the balance scheduled to be recognized as revenue in periods beyond of the million in backlog to be recognized as revenue during that is attributable to elpida  we received payment in the amount of million in december for cdp services and license fees for the three months ending march  strategy our mission is to drive our customers success by transforming r d and accelerating innovation in markets that derive competitive advantage from the interaction of materials science  processes  integration and device architecture 
we currently target high volume semiconductor and high growth emerging clean energy markets  including dram  stand alone non volatile memory  embedded memory  complex logic  flat glass coatings and glass based devices  solar cells  leds  displays and energy efficient technologies 
within these broad markets  we target customers that have track records of technological innovation  deploy significant resources and are pursuing technical advancements that are critical to their success and strategy  including atmi  elpida  first solar  globalfoundries  guardian industries  sandisk  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and toshiba 
atmi and elpida have commenced shipping products incorporating technology developed through our cdps and pay us licensing and royalty fees 
to date  we have received the majority of our revenue from customers in dram  stand alone non volatile memory  complex logic and energy efficient applications in flat glass coatings and glass based devices  and we have not yet received a material amount of revenue from customers in embedded memory  solar cells  leds  displays and other energy efficient technologies 
basis of presentation how we generate revenue our customer engagement process generates revenue in three ways cdp and services revenue  product revenue  and licensing and royalty revenue 
cdps are our primary engagement model with customers and are structured to result in licensing and or royalty revenue 
when we initially engage with a customer  we generate revenue from micro cdps  cdps and licensing of our high productivity combinatorial hpc platform 
our micro cdps are smaller  customer paid programs that require significantly less investment from our team but allow us to demonstrate the capabilities of our hpc platform to a customer without requiring a customer to commit to a multi year agreement 
we use these micro cdps to demonstrate the capabilities and value of our hpc platform to these new customers  with the objective of engaging with these customers in a full cdp 
when technology developed through cdps is incorporated in our customers commercialized products  we generate licensing and or royalty revenue 
in certain cases  we sell hpc processing tools to our customers who pay a recurring license fee to operate those tools with our combinatorial processing capabilities 

table of contents years ended december  in thousands revenue cdp and services revenue product revenue licensing and royalty revenue total revenue cdp and services revenue 
cdp revenue may include payments for full time equivalent employees  milestone payments  subscription payments for dedicated and shared workflow tools used in the cdp and reimbursed payments for consumables and outside services from third parties 
individual cdps typically range from one to three years 
services revenue outside of cdps is substantially comprised of support and maintenance fees and extended warranty agreements 
cdp and services revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with activities performed 
product revenue 
product revenue consists of sales of our workflow hardware and embedded software 
in support of our business strategy  we selectively sell our proprietary tools to increase opportunities for cdps and licensing fees and royalties 
historically  we have not sold a significant number of our workflow products and we do not anticipate selling a significant number in the future 
as our other revenue streams increase we expect our product revenue to decrease as a percentage of our overall revenue 
product revenue has been recognized upon shipment since january  product sales that originated prior to january  were generally recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance period once delivery occurred title and risk of loss passed to the customer  and customer acceptance  if required  was achieved 
licensing and royalty revenue 
licensing and royalty revenue consists of licensing fees and royalties for granting our customers rights to our proprietary technology and ip 
specifically  this includes licensing the hpc capabilities of our workflows  licensing our informatics and analysis software  and licensing fees and royalties on products commercialized by our customers that incorporate technology developed through our cdps 
in certain instances  minimum license fees and royalties may be guaranteed by customer contracts and are recognized as revenue ratably over the related periods 
during  in connection with a cdp  we recognized revenue on the sale of intellectual property that was developed during the term of the cdp 
in the last three years  licensing and royalty revenue has generally been the fastest growing element of our revenue 
over the long term  we expect licensing and royalty revenue to be an increasing and significant component of our revenue 
our revenue growth has been primarily driven by the adoption of our collaboration model and hpc platform leading to both new cdps and the ramp of licensing and royalty revenue from products commercialized by our customers that incorporate technology developed through our cdps 
successful cdps result in the commercialization of products whereby we receive licensing fees and royalties over the course of the respective product cycles 
certain of our semiconductor customers have already commenced shipping products incorporating technology developed through our cdps  which generate associated licensing and royalty revenue 
our revenue mix may vary from quarter to quarter as we enter into new cdps and related customer arrangements  existing cdps are completed or expanded and licensing and royalty arrangements generate revenue 
prior to entering into a new cdp  we negotiate licensing fees and royalty rates for technology to be developed in cdps 
the fees and rates are negotiated with each customer on the basis of multiple factors including the size of the servable market of the technology to be developed  the value contribution of the technology to the customer product  and the anticipated overall margin structure of the customer product 
licensing fees and royalty rates are set for each cdp developed technology 
while royalty rates vary  when working with device manufacturers  we typically target of their projected end product revenue for each cdp developed technology 
when working with suppliers to device manufacturers  we typically target higher royalty rates depending on the anticipated value contribution of the technology to their product 
licensing fees and royalty rates are structured in a variety of ways including fixed quarterly fees  percentage of revenue and fee per product 
our proprietary platform was initially created to address critical development challenges in the semiconductor industry and we began generating revenue in the applicability of our platform to address similar challenges in adjacent vertical markets such as clean energy markets has created  and we believe will continue to create  new market opportunities for us 
we began generating revenue from customers in the clean energy industry during the year ended december   and continued to generate revenue from customers in the clean energy industry through we believe collaborating with 
table of contents companies in the clean energy industry will accelerate the long term growth of our business 
the following table sets forth our revenue by customer end market years ended december  in thousands semiconductor clean energy total key financial metrics we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  manage our human resources and assess operational efficiencies 
revenue growth and mix 
we monitor revenue from cdps for existing and new customers  applications and the resulting licensing fees and royalties 
as our customer engagements progress  we expect licensing and royalty revenue to be an increasing and significant component of our revenue 
we are broadening our development and sales efforts by expanding cdps in the semiconductor industry resulting from the adoption of our hpc platform for technology development and engaging in cdps with companies in the clean energy industry as we believe this will accelerate the future growth of our business 
backlog 
we monitor our backlog as it represents the aggregate value of contracted business not yet recognized 
our backlog consists of future revenue that our customers are contractually committed to pay in our cdps and guaranteed licensing and royalty revenue for our developed technology and intellectual property 
our backlog as of december  was million  of which million is scheduled to be recognized as revenue during  and million is scheduled to be recognized as revenue in future periods beyond adjusted ebitda 
we monitor our adjusted ebitda to measure the profitability of our business 
we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures  tax positions such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items  interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  the impact of depreciation and amortization expense  the non cash impact of the mark to market of our derivative liability as a result of the symyx asset purchase transaction and common stock warrants issued to customers and the impact of stock based compensation expense 
see selected consolidated financial data non gaap financial measure for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income loss  the most comparable gaap measure 
adjusted earnings 
we monitor our adjusted earnings to measure the profitability of our business 
we use adjusted earnings as a performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures  the non cash impact of the mark to market of our derivative liability as a result of the symyx asset purchase transaction and common stock warrants issued to customers and the impact of stock based compensation expense 
see selected consolidated financial data non gaap financial measure for a reconciliation of our adjusted earnings to our net income loss  the most comparable gaap measure 
factors affecting our performance reliance on our customers success 
our success is tied to our customers ability to successfully commercialize the products that incorporate technology developed through cdps 
we believe that we significantly improve our customers ability to succeed in their end markets  but if they are unable to do so  the longer term licensing and royalty revenue that we expect may be delayed or may not materialize 
we attempt to manage this risk by carefully selecting projects and only participating in opportunities that we deem to have significant potential for long term success 
exposure to semiconductor memory and solar power end markets 
our performance is linked to the end markets in which our customers operate 
certain of these markets  such as the semiconductor memory markets and the solar panel market  have historically shown significant price volatility as a result of imbalances in supply and demand 
as such  these markets have been traditionally challenging for participants 
we attempt to manage this end market risk by participating in multiple end markets and by selecting customers that we believe will be successful in those markets 
revenue mix and royalty rates 
our revenue from cdps and product sales vary from contract to contract depending on the customer requirements and the scope of the collaboration 
the gross profit from cdps and product sales may vary 
table of contents based on the size and scope of the contract 
our royalty rates vary from contract to contract depending on multiple factors  including the industry  the scope of our collaboration  and the degree to which our ip is central to the development of a given product 
individual royalty opportunities vary depending on the end market size and the duration of the specific end product life cycle 
the gross profit from licensing and royalty revenue may vary based on the size and scope of the contract 
we target an average gross margin contribution that is consistent across the industries and end markets we serve 
long sales cycles 
our sales cycles are long  and we commit significant resources to and incur significant expenses for a project before a potential customer commits to use our hpc platform or cdps 
to be successful  we must establish contact with potential customers  often with senior management or executive officers  and educate them about the benefits of our hpc platform 
our sales cycles to date have typically ranged from to months and may be even longer in the future 
investment of time and resources in a particular customer engagement that does not ultimately result in material revenue will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
customer concentration 
due to the concentrated nature of manufacturers in the dram  flash memory and complex logic markets  our revenue is and may continue to be concentrated to key high volume customers 
for example  our five largest customers in the year ended december   four of which are in the semiconductor industry  accounted for of our revenue 
we believe there is an opportunity to expand our engagements with these customers into new applications over time 
in addition  because our platform is broadly applicable to semiconductors  flat glass coatings and glass based devices  solar cells  leds  flat panel displays  advanced batteries and other energy efficient technologies  we believe we have significant opportunities to engage with a broad range of customers 
related party transactions 
some of our customers and other business partners hold a significant stake in our capital stock 
related party transactions disclosed in our financial statements accounted for million and million  or and  respectively  of our revenue for the years ended december  and atmi  which beneficially owns approximately of our capital stock as of december   accounted for million and million  or and  respectively  of our revenue for the years ended december  and we believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with related parties are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties 
however  these relationships could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and our related parties or their affiliates 
in addition  conflicts of interest may arise between us and our related parties and their affiliates 
the appearance of conflicts  even if such conflicts do not materialize  might adversely affect the public perception of us  as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future  including new cdps with competitors of such related parties  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business 
warrants issued in connection with a cdp in march  in connection with a cdp  we issued contingent warrants to two customers to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock at a cash exercise price of per share 
the exercise price was equal to the price of the then most recent sale of preferred stock 
these warrants become exercisable for four months after an election by the holders to license technology developed through the associated cdp 
if either of the customers elect to license this technology  we will record a one time  non cash charge based on the fair value of these warrants as measured on the date of election against any revenue derived from these agreements 
the fair value will be determined using the black scholes option pricing model and may be significant 
this election is available to the customers initially through may  but the election period may be extended if the customers extend the cdp 
had the election been made on december  the fair value of these warrants would have been million 
in june  in connection with a cdp  we issued a fully vested and exercisable warrant to a customer to purchase  shares of our common stock at a cash exercise price of per share 
the exercise price was equal to the price of the then most recent sale of preferred stock 
this warrant was fully exercised in connection with our initial public offering in november the fair value of the warrant as measured on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model was  and was recognized as a reduction of revenue derived from the agreement during the year ended december  
table of contents cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue the following table sets forth our cost of revenue by revenue category years ended december  in thousands cost of revenues cost of cdp and services revenue cost of product revenue cost of licensing and royalty revenue total cost of revenues our cost of revenue is variable and depends on the product mix and type of revenue earned in each period relating to our customer programs 
as customers commercialize products that incorporate technology developed through our cdps  we expect our cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue when licensing and royalty revenue become an increasing component of our revenue 
as a result of our asset purchase transaction with symyx technologies  inc symyx  the amortization of acquired patents is being recorded in cost of revenue 
cost of cdp and services revenue 
our cost of cdp and services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and other personnel related expenses including stock based compensation for our collaborative research and development scientists  engineers and development fab process operations employees 
additionally  our cost of revenue includes costs of wafers  targets  materials  program related supplies  third party professional fees and depreciation of equipment used in cdps 
cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue primarily includes our cost of products sold 
our cost of product revenue will fluctuate based on the type of product and configuration sold 
historically  we have not sold a significant number of our workflow products and we do not anticipate selling a significant number in the future 
cost of product revenue has been recognized upon product shipment since january  for product sales that originated prior to january   our cost of product revenue was recognized in a similar manner as the corresponding product revenue and was generally recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance period 
the variability in cost of product revenue as a percentage of revenue is related to the quantity and configuration of products sold during the period and the corresponding maintenance period over which product revenue and cost of product revenue is being recognized 
cost of licensing and royalty revenue 
our cost of licensing and royalty revenue prior to january  included license fees paid to symyx 
as part of our completion of the symyx asset purchase transaction in november  in connection with our initial public offering  we no longer have an obligation to pay licensing fees to symyx for any period on or after january  in  our cost of licensing and royalty revenue has been  and we expect will continue to be  primarily comprised of the amortization of acquired patents and licensing obligations 
research and development our r d expenses consist of costs incurred for development and continuous improvement of our hpc platform  expansion of software capabilities and application research and development that are not associated with customer programs 
r d costs include personnel related expenses including stock based compensation expenses for our technical staff as well as consultant costs  parts and prototypes  wafers  chemicals  supply costs  facilities costs  utilities costs related to laboratories and offices occupied by technical staff  depreciation on equipment used by technical staff  and outside services  such as machining and third party r d costs 
overhead costs that are not allocated to a customer program are recognized as expenses within r d 
we expect our r d expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to devote substantial internal resources to develop and improve our hpc platform and extend the applicability of our platform to a broader set of applications within the industries we serve 

table of contents sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs including stock based compensation for our sales and marketing employees  as well as payments of commissions to our sales employees  facility costs and professional expenses 
professional expenses consist of external website and marketing communication consulting costs and market research 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we increase the number of our sales and marketing employees to support the growth in our business and as we incur increasing external marketing communication costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs including stock based compensation as well as professional services and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  legal  human resources  management information systems and information technology functions 
professional services consist of outside accounting  information technology  consulting and legal costs 
we also incur significant accounting and legal costs related to compliance with rules and regulations enacted by the securities and exchange commission  including the additional costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as additional insurance  investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company 
in addition to these expenses  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
interest expense income  net interest expense primarily consists of interest accrued on our note payable to symyx in connection with the symyx asset purchase transaction that closed in november interest income represents interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we expect interest income will vary each reporting period depending on our average investment balances during the period and market interest rates 
other income expense  net other income consists of municipal economic development grant proceeds received during the year ended december  other income expense  net also consists of the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrants and derivative liability and other income 
prior to the exercise of the preferred stock warrant we issued in connection with a line of credit  we had classified the warrant as a liability and remeasured it to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding gain or loss from the adjustment recorded as other income expense  net 
following the exercise of the warrant in connection with our initial public offering in november  the warrant is no longer outstanding and will not be remeasured at each balance sheet date 
in connection with entering into the symyx asset purchase transaction we recorded a derivative liability representing the value of the guaranteed return to symyx and reimbursement of of the underwriting discounts and commissions payable in connection with our initial public offering 
we adjusted the fair value of the derivative liability to market value at each balance sheet date with the final remeasurement occurring upon the consummation of our initial public offering that closed in november with the change in the market value of the derivative liability recorded in other income expense  net 
effective as of the company initial public offering in november these preferred stock warrants and derivative liability are no longer outstanding 
provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business 
earnings from our non us activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current us income tax 
to date  we have incurred net losses and have not recorded any us federal income tax benefits as these losses have been offset by valuation allowances 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  represent federal and state tax deductions from stock based compensation which will be recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital when they reduce taxes payable 
in addition  we had million in us federal r d credit and million in california r d credit carryforwards to offset future income tax liabilities 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and our ability to use our tax credit carryforwards to offset future income tax liabilities may be subject to certain limitations arising from ownership changes within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from three principal sources cdps and other services  which also includes other r d services and product maintenance and support  product sales  and technology licensing and or sales and royalty fees 
it is possible for our customers to work with us across multiple areas of our business  and certain of our customer arrangements involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or licenses 
for example  product sale arrangements include product maintenance and support  and cdps and other r d services include licensing of technology and may also include sales of products or developed technology 
when there are multiple elements of deliverables in a contract entered into or modified on or prior to december   we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue among all of the undelivered elements  which might include cdp and other services revenue  product revenue and licensing and royalty revenue  based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any such element 
in the event that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist  revenue will be recognized over the term of the agreement and will be allocated among the deliverables based on the relative stated invoice price for the elements 
in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognize revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with the authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition 
for all transactions entered into after december   we recognize revenue using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for determination of estimated selling price of elements in each arrangement if available  and since third party evidence is not available for those elements where vendor specific objective evidence of selling price cannot be determined  we evaluate factors to determine its estimated selling prices esp for all other elements 
in multiple element arrangements where hardware and software are sold as part of the solution  revenue is allocated to recognize hardware and software using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement 
cdp and services revenue 
we enter into cdps with customers under which we conduct r d activities jointly with the customer 
these agreements specify minimum levels of research effort required to be performed by us 
payments received under the agreements are not refundable if the research effort is not successful 
historically  we have not provided any refunds under these arrangements 
we retain rights to certain elements of technology developed during the course of performance  which the customer has an option to license in the future under the terms defined in the agreement 
we typically recognize revenue from these arrangements on a time and materials basis 
most arrangements with customers have fixed monthly fees and requirements to provide regular reporting of r d activities performed 
payments received prior to performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned over future performance periods 
product maintenance and support services revenue is included in cdp and services revenue 
these services entitle customers to receive product updates and enhancements or technical support and maintenance  depending on the offering 
the related revenue is recognized ratably over the period the services are delivered 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price for our product maintenance and support services 
product revenue 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products generally once delivery has occurred title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and customer acceptance  if required  has been achieved 
licensing and royalty revenue 
we recognize revenue for licenses to ip when earned pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
time based license revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
sales of intellectual property or developed technology are recognized upon the transfer of ownership 
license and royalty revenue that becomes triggered by specific customer actions  such as exercise of a license option or by sales volume  is recognized when they occur based on royalty reports or other information received from the licensee  generally one quarter in arrears 
minimum and prepaid royalties and license fees are recognized ratably over the related periods 
stock based compensation 
table of contents we recognize compensation costs related to stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the grant date fair value for stock options  and the resulting stock based compensation expense  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the grant date fair value of the stock based awards is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards 
the fair value of the awards granted are calculated using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions include expected term 
the expected term represents the period that the stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
for option grants that are considered to be plain vanilla  we used the simplified method to determine the expected term as provided by the sec 
the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options 
expected volatility 
the expected volatility is derived from historical volatilities of several unrelated  publicly listed peer companies over a period approximately equal to the expected term of the award because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock since we have a limited trading history 
when making the selections of our industry peer companies to be used in the volatility calculation  we considered the size  operational and economic similarities to our principal business operations 
expected dividend rate 
the expected dividend rate was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards 
in addition to the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model  we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock based compensation for our awards 
our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility  expected terms and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock based compensation calculations on a prospective basis 
as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock and stock option exercises  we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility  expected terms and forfeiture rates  which could materially impact our future stock based compensation expense 
in valuing our common stock equity grants prior to our initial public offering in november  we determined a business enterprise value of our company by taking a weighted combination of the enterprise values calculated under two valuation approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates the present value of future estimated cash flows  based upon forecasted revenue and costs 
these future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate which is derived from an analysis of the cost of capital of comparable publicly traded companies in the same industry or similar lines of business as of each valuation date and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows 
the market approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies in the same industry or similar lines of business which are based on key metrics implied by the enterprise values or acquisition values of the comparable publicly traded companies 
the results of the income approach and the market approach were then weighted evenly to determine the fair value of our business 
this fair value was then allocated to each of our classes of stock according to assumptions made by our board of directors regarding the likelihood of various liquidity events and an analysis of the rights and preferences of our various securities 
as of december  we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

table of contents liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in november  we substantially satisfied our capital and liquidity needs through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and  to a lesser extent  cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of net working capital 
during the year ended december   we closed a private placement of our series e redeemable convertible preferred stock for million in net proceeds and completed our initial public offering which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of million 
in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering in november  we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants 
as of december   we had debt outstanding of million related to the promissory note payable to symyx as a result of the completion of the symyx asset purchase transaction 
during the year ended december   the company paid symyx million  which included interest in the amount of million and principal in the amount of million 
as of december   we anticipate that million will need to be paid in november our obligations under the promissory note require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on interest and principal of the promissory note at or prior to maturity  thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes 
such limitations increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the economy  our industry and new opportunities that may arise 
in addition  our obligations under the promissory note and the security interests granted in favor of symyx may make it more difficult for us to borrow funds in the future to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have incurred significant losses 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million  and million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next months 
however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to meet business requirements are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  many of which are set forth in greater detail under the caption risk factors  but generally include without limitation our rate of revenue growth  our expansion of our sales and marketing activities and overhead expenses  the timing and extent of our spending to support our r d efforts and our ability to expand cdps in the semiconductor industry  whether we are successful in obtaining payments from customers  the financial stability of our customers  whether we can enter into additional collaborations in our target industries  the progress and scope of collaborative r d projects performed by us and our customers  the effect of any acquisitions of other businesses or technologies that we may make in the future  the filing  prosecution and enforcement of patent claims  how much we need to develop or enhance our solutions or hpc platform and any necessary responses to competitive pressures 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our operations  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
we may also seek to invest in or acquire complementary businesses  applications or technologies  any of which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
we maintain almost all of our cash in the united states and therefore are not subject to restrictions or tax obligations as we access the cash

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt obligations 
our cash  cash equivalents and investment accounts as of december  total million  consisting primarily of cash and money market funds with maturities of less than three months from the date of purchase 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the united states 
however  because of the short term nature of the instruments in our portfolio  a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or our results of operation 
in connection with the consummation of the symyx asset purchase transaction  which occurred in connection with the consummation of our initial public offering  we issued a promissory note payable to symyx 
as of december   the note had a principal amount equal to million and a remaining term approximately months and an interest rate of and is payable in amounts equal to the greater of million per quarter or the amount of accrued interest  with a balloon payment at maturity  if applicable 
while the interest rate on our debt is fixed in the event we enter into other long term debt arrangements  we could be subject to fluctuations in interest rates which could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operation 
foreign currency exchange risk as we expand internationally  our consolidated results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located  which is primarily in the united states  with an insignificant portion of expenses incurred in our wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and japan and our wholly owned branch in taiwan in their local currencies 
the effect of a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
to date  we have not entered into any material foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future
