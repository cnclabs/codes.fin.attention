item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
in addition to historical information  the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those matters discussed under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a supplier of semiconductor wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits ics 
our manufacturing equipment is primarily used for semiconductor manufacturing  utilizing innovative technology to deliver advanced processing capabilities and high productivity for the fabrication of current and next generation ics 
we were incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in our business depends upon capital expenditures by the manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices 
since the demand for semiconductor devices is highly cyclical  the demand for wafer processing equipment also is highly cyclical 
the semiconductor equipment industry typically is characterized by wide swings in operating results as the industry rotates between cycles 
demand also is becoming prone to seasonality due to the buying patterns of customers  which is dependent upon the consumer product industry 
we have made progress in our strategic initiatives over the past several years and are strengthening our product positions 
in the etch market  during  we further extended our position with our paradigme system  as we added capabilities that improve on wafer performance while keeping costs low 
our paradigme systems continued to be released for production and development in the foundry logic segments of the industry 
our paradigme system is also in qualification process for advanced d nand production 
we now have over etch systems in production at our customers 
during  in the rapid thermal processing rtp market  our helios xp system was shipped and moved into production in nand facilities 
we received the first follow on order and shipment to a leading foundry customer 
we also extended our rtp position by shipping the helios xp to a fourth foundry customer 
in millisecond anneal  we sold our millios system to a major foundry logic semiconductor manufacturer  and placed a millios system at another customer site for evaluation 
strip is our most prolific product line with solid market share positions across the foundry logic  dram and nand markets 
our suprema system delivers a broad capability to our customers from bulk strip to critical strip for finfet and d nand 
we have strengthened our technical performance and secured production tool of record status for the nanometer technology node and development tool of record at leading nanometer development facilities 
we experienced industry weakness during the second half as our customers reacted to the global economic environment and their expectation of supply and demand for their products 
we currently expect such weakness to continue at least through the first quarter of in december  we initiated a broad based cost reduction plan restructuring plan 
the first phase of the restructuring plan included the transfer of the research  development and pilot line production of our millios system from vancouver  canada to our facility in dornstadt  germany  moving a portion of our outsourced spare parts logistics operations in house  workforce reductions  the elimination of certain contractors  and the renegotiation of certain contracts 
during  we initiated two additional phases of the restructuring plan that expanded on the aforementioned cost reduction activities but also included  in the latter part of  salary reductions through furlough programs and the consolidation of our global manufacturing operations to our corporate headquarters in fremont  california 
on january   we announced plans for the fourth phase of the restructuring plan  which primarily consists of further workforce reductions across all areas of the company 
all four phases of the restructuring plan are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of we expect that our cost reduction initiatives included in the restructuring plan will provide reductions of over million in annual operating expenses beginning in the second quarter of as of december   we have incurred million in restructuring charges under the restructuring plan  of which million was recorded in  and expect to incur an additional million to million  of which the majority is expected to be incurred by the end of the first quarter of in addition to expenses incurred under the restructuring plan  we also expect to incur up to million in capital expenditures in related to the transfer of research  development and pilot line production of the millios system to our facility in dornstadt  germany and the consolidation of global manufacturing in our facility in fremont  california 
as a result of the aforementioned cost reduction activities  our gross margin improved percentage points to percent in as compared to percent in despite a decrease in industry demand in the second half of total operating expenses of million  which included million in restructuring charges  decreased million from total operating expenses in of million  which included million in restructuring charges 
as a result of our ongoing gross margin improvement and cost reduction efforts  we expect a significant reduction in our cash flow break even point for fiscal year as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million and working capital of million 
with our current cash and liquidity position  we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements for the next months 
we will continue to review our operations and take further actions  as necessary  to minimize the cash used in operations and retain sufficient liquidity to fund our operating activities 
however  improvements in our results of operations and resulting cash position are largely dependent upon an improvement in the semiconductor equipment industry 
the future success of our business will depend on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for semiconductors and semiconductor wafer processing equipment 
such factors also will include our ability to a enhance our competitiveness and profitability  b develop and bring to market new products that address our customers needs  c grow customer loyalty through collaboration with and support of our customers  d maintain a cost structure that will enable us to operate effectively and profitably throughout changing industry cycles  and e generate the gross profits necessary to enable us to make the necessary investments in our business 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty obligations  bad debts  income taxes  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring  income taxes and stock based compensation as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive net sales from the following primary sources equipment tool or system sales  spare part sales and service and maintenance contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition  we recognize revenue on equipment sales as follows for equipment sales of existing products with new specifications and for sales of new products  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  for equipment sales to existing customers with previously demonstrated equipment acceptance  or equipment sales to new customers purchasing equipment with established reliability  we recognize revenue on a multiple element approach in which revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer 
the revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items such as installation and customer acceptance 
for equipment sales we generally recognize revenue for percent of the total invoice amount as revenue upon shipment while percent of the equipment cost is recognized upon shipment 
the remaining portion  generally percent of the total invoice amount  is contingent upon customer acceptance and is recognized once installation services are completed and final customer acceptance of the equipment is received 
for multiple element arrangements initiated at or prior to december   the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at its estimated fair values until delivery of the deferred elements 
for multiple element arrangements initiated or materially modified subsequent to december   the revenue relating to the undelivered elements should be deferred using the relative selling price method  which allocates revenue to each element using the estimated selling prices for the deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available 
we have determined that the fair value of installation services is substantially less than the of the total invoice amount typically assigned to the installation element in our customer agreements 
as such  since the amount collectible upon successful installation and customer acceptance exceeds the fair value of the installation services  we defer the amount collectible upon successful installation and customer acceptance 
from time to time  we allow customers to evaluate equipment  with the customer maintaining the right to return the equipment at its discretion with limited or no penalty 
for this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until customer acceptance is received 
for spare parts  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
for service and maintenance contracts  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract or as services are performed 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable for which revenue has not been recognized are classified as advance billings 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and record specific allowances for bad debts when a customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  as in the case of bankruptcy filings or a deteriorated financial position 
we estimate the allowances for bad debts for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we write off a receivable when all rights  remedies and recourses against the account and its principals are exhausted and record a benefit when previously reserved accounts are collected 
warranty 
the warranty we offer on equipment sales is generally months  except where previous customer agreements state otherwise 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty  based on historical costs  is recorded as a cost of sale when the revenue is recognized for the sale of the related equipment 
our warranty obligations require us to repair or replace defective products or parts during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
the actual system performance and or field expense profiles may differ from historical experience  and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly 
actual warranty reserves and settlements against reserves are highly dependent on our equipment volumes 
inventory valuation 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  in each reporting period 
although we attempt to accurately forecast future inventory demand  given the competitive pressures and cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
we evaluate the carrying value of inventory for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand  and reduce the carrying value of our inventory accordingly 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory reductions for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
we measure certain of our assets at fair value  using observable market data 
the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  and establishes valuation hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of assets or liabilities 
the authoritative guidance also establishes three classes of assets or liabilities level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets  level consists of assets and liabilities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used such as prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or for identical assets or liabilities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data  and level consists of assets and liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our cash equivalents and equity instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy  as these instruments are valued using quoted market prices 
we had no assets or liabilities classified within level or as of december  and impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  intangibles and other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
restructuring 
we recognize expenses related to employee termination benefits when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required of the employee 
if an employee is required to render service until a specific termination date in order to receive the termination benefits  the fair value of the associated liability would be recognized ratably over the future service period 
the costs of severance are determined by local statutory requirements and our policies 
for some entities  where salaries are paid during the notice period  a portion of the severance reserves would be based on estimates of the ability to find employment during the notice period  and we would determine the reserves in accordance with these estimates 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future lease payments with no future economic benefit 
in future periods  we will record accretion expense to increase the liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the lease 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to secure a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
if actual lease exit costs differ from estimates  we would adjust the restructuring charge  which would impact net income in the period any adjustment was recorded 
income taxes 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
for all tax jurisdictions  except korea  we recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as we expect it is more likely than not that we will not realize our net deferred tax asset as of december  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income and losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which would change income in the period of the adjustment 
stock based compensation 
we measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  on the date of grant  and we recognize the related stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of certain of our stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which includes expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option  expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock  and the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury rate with a maturity approximating the expected life of the option 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future  accordingly  the expected dividend yield is zero 
we estimate forfeiture rates on stock based awards at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
such forfeiture estimates are based on historical experience 
if the assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense change in future periods  the amount of future stock based compensation may differ significantly from the amounts we recorded in the current and prior periods 
stock based compensation expense in  and was million  million and million  respectively

results of operations a summary of our results of operations for years ended december   and are as follows in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  increase decrease amount percent amount percent amount percent net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense  net other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss years ended december increase decrease amount percent amount percent amount percent net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative restructuring charges n m total operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense  net n m other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes n m net loss not meaningful 
net sales a summary of our net sales for years ended december   and are as follows in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  increase decrease increase decrease amount percent amount percent net sales united states international korea taiwan other asia europe and others total net sales net sales were million for the year ended december   a million  or percent  decrease compared to million for the year ended december   primarily driven by lower overall net sales of etch and strip systems into memory applications 
we experienced lower industry demand in the second half of as our customers reacted to the global economic environment  and we expect such weakness to continue at least through the first quarter of net sales were million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the improvement in the global economy and the semiconductor equipment sector as compared to the prior year  and from our continued penetration in the etch market which contributed over one third of our system sales in in  system sales generated from the etch market were over million higher than in during  sales to customers in asia continued to account for a significant portion of our total net sales 
for the years ended december   and  international sales comprised approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  of our total net sales 
cost of sales and gross margin a summary of our cost of sales and gross profit for years ended december   and are as follows in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  increase decrease increase decrease amount percent amount percent cost of sales gross profit gross margin our cost of sales consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials and related overhead  labor  warranty costs  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and costs incurred by our contract manufacturers in the production of our components and major sub assemblies modules 
our gross margin improved percentage points from percent in to percent in the increase in gross margin in as compared to the same period in was primarily due to higher system margins resulting from a favorable mix of higher margin systems compared to the prior year 
in  our gross margin also benefited from cost savings resulting from manufacturing the majority of our systems in house as opposed to using a contract manufacturer 
these increases in gross margin were partially offset by the increase of unabsorbed overhead costs as a result of lower production levels 
the gross margin rate improved from percent in to percent in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to operating leverage from higher net sales volumes and improved utilization of our internal manufacturing operations  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in warranty provisions related to servicing our new products and a higher number of sales from our lower margin aspen iii systems  as compared to our total sales mix 
our gross margin has varied over the years and will continue to be affected by many factors  including competitive pressures  product mix  inventory reserves  economies of scale  material and other costs  overhead absorption levels and the timing of revenue recognition 
operating expenses in december  we initiated the restructuring plan  which in addition to general cost reduction activities  included consolidation of our manufacturing and research and development facilities  moving a portion of our outsourced spare parts logistics operations in house  and workforce reductions 
we expect that our cost reduction initiatives included in the restructuring plan will provide a reduction of over million in annual operating expenses beginning in the second quarter of combined with the ongoing gross margin improvement efforts  our cash flow break even point is expected to be reduced to the mid to high million quarterly net sales level beginning in the second quarter of our financial results for the year ended december  benefited from the favorable impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
our total operating expenses decreased million in the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
research  development and engineering a summary of our research  development and engineering expenses for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands  except for percentages the years ended december  increase decrease increase decrease amount percent amount percent research  development and engineering percentage of net sales research  development and engineering expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  costs of product development and depreciation on equipment used in the course of research  development and engineering activities 
research  development and engineering expenses decreased million  or percent  in as compared to the decrease is largely attributable to reductions in employee related expenses  engineering materials  depreciation expense on lab tools  and certain facilities and information technology costs 
the decreases in employee related expenses were primarily due to a decrease in headcount 
the decreases in engineering materials and certain facility costs are a result of our other cost reduction activities that have been on going since the fourth quarter of the decrease in depreciation expense of million on lab tools was the result of several assets being fully depreciated as of the end of research  development and engineering expenses were million in  a decrease of million or percent  compared to million in the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses was primarily due to a decrease of million in depreciation expense on lab tools resulting from significantly lower capital expenditures in through as compared to earlier years  and from a million decrease in engineering materials used in new product development projects

selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to a decrease in amortization of million and other costs associated with supporting our evaluation tools at customer sites which was related  in part  to our ability to convert certain of these tools into sales during the past year  a decrease in depreciation expense related to fully depreciated assets  a decrease in employee related expenses and outside services costs and a decrease in facilities costs as a result of certain lease termination agreements entered into at the end of the decrease in employee related expenses and outside services was largely due to cost reduction activities that have been on going since the fourth quarter of as well as lower sales commissions resulting from lower net sales in selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million compared to million in the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million allocation of field service costs to cost of sales as a result of higher utilization rates  a decrease of million in outside service spending levels and a decrease of stock compensation expense of million  partially offset by a million reduction year over year in the collection of certain accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts and a million increase in amortization expense for evaluation tools placed at customer sites in late restructuring charges prior to the initiation of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  annualized operating expenses from the third quarter of was million 
we expect that our cost reduction initiatives included in the restructuring plan will provide reductions of over million in annual operating expenses beginning in the second quarter of as measured against annualized operating expenses in the third quarter of as of december   we have incurred million in restructuring charges under the restructuring plan  of which million was recorded during  and expect to incur an additional million to million  of which the majority is expected to be incurred by the end of the first quarter of during the year ended december   we recorded million of employee severance and other expenses and million contract termination costs 
we paid million in employee severance and other expenses and paid million in contract termination costs related to the restructuring plan 
in addition to expenses incurred under the restructuring plan  we also expect to incur up to million in capital expenditures in related to the transfer of research  development and pilot line production of the millios system to our facility in dornstadt  germany and the consolidation of global manufacturing to our facility in fremont  california 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in contract termination costs related to revised estimates of our future rent obligations associated with a vacated leased facility  net of sublease income 
the revised estimates are based on a settlement with the landlord  which includes exiting from the lease arrangement in july  rather than the initial lease expiration of march the final settlement also reduces our total future lease commitments from million to million  which includes a lease termination and other fees of million 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million of income in the year ended december   and primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains related to inter company balances denominated in foreign currencies 
other income expense  net was million of income in the year ended december   an increase of million when compared to the million of income in the increase in income was due to a million gain related to the extinguishment of certain liabilities  partially offset by net foreign exchange losses primarily related to our foreign denominated balances at our us operations 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  which consisted of deferred tax expense relating to an accrual of million deferred tax liability on foreign earnings that may be repatriated and current foreign taxes of million  partially offset by a million benefit from the release of various federal and foreign reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes was million in  which consisted of deferred tax expense from the creation of a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets in a foreign jurisdiction  current foreign taxes of million and current federal and state income taxes of million  partially offset by a million benefit from the release of various foreign reserves 
currently  we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for all jurisdictions  except for korea  due to uncertainties and other negative evidence in our current operations and our expectations of future operations 
it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes could be favorably impacted going forward if our results of operations and forecasts for future profitability improve sufficiently to indicate that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
such a change in management expectations could result in a material change to our valuation allowance assessment and the resulting income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents was million as of december   a decrease of million  compared to million as of december  working capital as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  stockholders equity as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the net increases decreases in cash and cash equivalents are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents liquidity and capital resources outlook as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we believe that our cash balances will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next months 
our operations require careful management of our cash and working capital balances 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  fluctuations in our net sales  gross profits and operating expenses  as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
for example  our net sales for the year ended december  decreased percent compared to the same period in the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult to predict our future liquidity needs with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry would result in short term uses of cash to fund inventory purchases 
in addition  our cost reduction efforts may prove ineffective and cause us to incur additional losses in the future and lower our cash balances 
we may need additional funds to support our working capital requirements and operating expenses  or for other requirements 
historically  we have relied on a combination of fundraising from the sale and issuance of equity securities such as our common stock offering in may and cash generated from product  service and royalty revenues to provide funding for our operations 
improvements in our results of operations and resulting cash position are largely dependent upon an improvement in the semiconductor equipment industry 
we periodically review our liquidity position and may decide to raise additional funds  and may seek such funding from a combination of sources including  but not limited to  an asset backed financing agreement or the issuance of equity or debt securities through public or private financings 
these financing options may not be available on a timely basis  or on terms acceptable to us  and could be dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve our intended long term business objectives could be limited 
operating activities in the year ended december   net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of million in net loss and a million decrease in cash reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash charges of million 
cash flow decreases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million decrease in accounts payable  accrued compensation and benefits  and other current liabilities  a million decrease in deferred revenue  a million decrease in other liabilities and a million increase in inventory  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and advance billings and a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the decrease in accounts receivable  advance billings and deferred revenues reflects the decrease in net sales and business activities in compared to the decrease in accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities was primarily attributable to reduction in purchases and expenditures as a result of lower sales and the impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million  partially offset by million of cash increases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities and non cash charges of million 
cash flow increases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million increase in accounts receivable and advance billings 
the increase in accounts receivable and advance billings reflects the increase in sales and business activities in as compared to non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million for deferred income taxes and million of stock based compensation 
in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised primarily of a net loss of million and million of cash decreases reflected in the net change in assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash charges of million 
cash flow decreases resulting from the net change in assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable and advance billings and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities and a million increase in deferred revenue 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable reflect the sharp increase in sales and business activities in as compared to non cash charges consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  and million for deferred taxes  partially offset by million from the collection of accounts receivable previously provided for in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the recent industry downturn 
cash provided by operations may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our net sales and operating results  amount of revenue deferred  inventory purchases  collection of accounts receivable and timing of payments 
investing activities in the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  which consists primarily of our capital spending 
in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised primarily of million of maturities of available for sale investments  million decrease in restricted cash used to secure standby letters of credit provided to certain vendors  and million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised primarily of million of maturities of available for sale investments in excess of purchases  partially offset by a million increase in restricted cash and million of property and equipment purchases 
our property and equipment purchases were primarily for tools and equipment used in our manufacturing activities 
the increase in restricted cash represents purchases of certificates of deposit used to secure standby letters of credit we provided to certain vendors during the year 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of million of proceeds from our public offering on may  of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share of common stock 
the million of proceeds is net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million 
the net proceeds from this offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in addition  we also realized million in net proceeds from employee stock plan transactions 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting of net proceeds from employee stock plan transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
our contractual commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table in thousands vendor commitments for the year ending operating leases inventory other total total commitments thereafter other vendor commitments primarily include service related contracts and agreements for information technology support  commitments for non inventory purchases of assets  and other service related commitments 
we continue to lease one building in exton  pennsylvania that was previously used to house the administrative functions related to wet surface preparation products 
the original lease for the administrative building was scheduled to expire on march   with a current rental cost of approximately million annually 
in december  we reached a settlement with the landlord  which includes exiting from the lease arrangement in july the settlement also reduces our total future lease obligations from million to million  which includes million in lease termination and other fees 
of the million in future lease commitments  we expect to pay out million in and the remaining balance on a declining basis through july we continue to sublease a portion of the exton facility  which is cancelable by our subtenant anytime after december  we recorded million sublease income under the current sublease agreement during in determining facilities lease loss liability  various assumptions were made  including the time period over which the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease terms and expected sublease rates 
at december  and  we had an accrued liability balance of million and million  respectively  related to this facility 
adjustments to this accrual will be made in future periods  if events and circumstances change 
our deferred income taxes have been excluded from the table above because the related future cash outflows are uncertain 
as of december   we had approximately million of net unrecognized tax benefits that may be subject to examination by applicable tax authorities 
we are uncertain of the timing and amounts of any potential future payments related to these unrecognized tax benefits 
in connection with our acquisition of vortek industries  ltd

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks related foreign exchange rates 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   our portfolio consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we did not have any short term investments as of december  our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to money market funds  which we may purchase at different points in time  and the potential losses arising from changes in those interest rates 
our investment objective is to achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation and our liquidity requirements 
our strategy is to invest our cash in a manner that preserves capital  maintains sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements  and maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our portfolio  which consisted primarily of money market funds  includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we classify our cash equivalents in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  and consider investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
our equity instruments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
based on the size of our investment portfolio as of december   an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period  and net sales and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period 
gains or losses from translation of foreign operations are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred 
because much of our net sales and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the strength of the us dollar relative to the currencies of other countries in which we operate 
exchange rate fluctuations of greater than ten percent  primarily for the us dollar relative to the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen or korean won  could have a material impact on our financial statements 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses fluctuate depending upon the mix of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and whether the local currency of an entity strengthens or weakens during a period 
as of december   our us operations had approximately million  net  in foreign denominated operating inter company payables 
it is estimated that a ten percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies would lead to a profit of million us dollar strengthening  or a loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these inter company payables  which would be recorded as other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded million net foreign currency exchange gain and million net foreign currency loss in the years ended december  and  respectively  in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
our net foreign exchange gains loss was zero for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we included million and million  respectively  in foreign currency translation adjustment gains in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss 
the million foreign exchange translation adjustment gain in the year ended december  was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the korean won  the euro and the singapore dollar and partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
these changes in foreign currency exchanges rates favorably impacted the net assets used in our foreign operations 
the cumulative translation adjustment as of december  and was million and million  respectively
