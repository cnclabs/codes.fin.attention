item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting our consolidated statements of income for the years through and consolidated statements of financial condition as of december  and when we use the terms privatebancorp  the company  we  us  and our  we mean privatebancorp  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
when we use the term the bank  we are referring to our wholly owned banking subsidiary  the privatebank and trust company 
the following discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a comprehensive review of our operating results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto  and other financial information presented in this form k 
unless otherwise stated  all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis 
overview we reported net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for  more than double the million  or per diluted share reported for return on average common equity and average assets for were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the improvement in performance is primarily a reflection of our significant improvement in asset quality as charge offs and the provision for loan losses declined considerably 
despite higher revenues driven primarily by loan growth  lower funding costs and increased fee income  operating profit was relatively flat year over year due to high non interest expense 
we restructured our capital base in fourth quarter when we repurchased all of the million of preferred stock and related warrants issued in to the us treasury under the tarp cpp using million in net proceeds from two separate underwritten public offerings million common stock offering and million subordinated debentures offering  together with existing cash resources 
net revenue increased by million to million for  compared to million for  with higher levels of net interest income and greater fee revenue contributing to the current year improvement 
non interest income increased by million in compared to  and excluding the impact million of higher net securities gains in than in  non interest income increased by million  or  in with revenues from mortgage banking  capital markets and syndications leading the year over year growth 
operating profit totaled million for  remaining relatively flat to the level of million as increased non interest expense largely offset revenue advances 
non interest expense increased in compared to and was largely impacted by higher incentive and equity compensation costs and increased net foreclosed property expense  from greater valuation adjustments and property ownership costs 
our efficiency ratio was  up from for net interest income increased by million  or  in compared to benefiting from higher average interest earning assets and lower deposit costs due mostly to a shift in deposit mix toward non interest bearing deposits and downward pricing from the prior year 
however  growth in net interest income was muted by lower average yields on earning assets due to the ongoing low interest rate environment and competitive pricing pressures 
net interest margin was for compared to for the prior year reflecting greater pressure on loan yields coupled with declining investment yields which were partially offset by a reduction in cost of funds 
although cost of funds and net interest margin will be adversely impacted by the interest expense associated with the fourth quarter issuance of million subordinated debt  the debt issuance and preferred stock redemption will overall benefit net income available to common stockholders as the redemption of preferred stock enabled us to replace million of annual dividends and accretion with after tax interest expense of million 
during  total loans grew billion  or  from year end  with most of the growth in the commercial and industrial portfolio  which represented of total loans at year end compared to at year end while we experienced loan growth throughout the year  fourth quarter loan volumes were unusually high as some of our clients made strategic moves prior to year end in anticipation of potential tax changes set to occur in the pace of loan growth is expected to be slower going into than it was in the fourth quarter in addition  we have plans to syndicate a portion of some fourth quarter loan transactions which will also reduce loan growth in the first half of 
table of contents total deposits increased by billion to billion at december  reflecting our bank wide initiatives focused on client deposit growth 
deposit levels in  in particular noninterest bearing deposits and money market accounts  were also heavily influenced by the excess cash position of many of our commercial middle market clients  which will fluctuate based on their business needs 
we maintained a higher level of liquidity during the second half of due to uncertainty around potential deposit activity related to the expiration of the unlimited deposit insurance on non interest bearing accounts at year end and also experienced significant client deposits inflows late in the year 
consistent with activity seen last year  we have experienced some deposit outflows during the first quarter to date 
our asset quality position improved meaningfully during as reflected in all key credit quality metrics 
total nonperforming assets and loans declined and  respectively  from december  levels with nonperforming assets to total assets representing at year end compared to at december  dispositions of early stage problem loans and nonperforming assets totaled million 
we had significant reductions in nonperforming loan inflows in as well as fewer early stage problem loans that developed 
with credit quality improving  the provision for loans losses  excluding covered assets  declined million from levels and we reduced our allowance for loan losses by million from the prior year end 
as the number of oreo properties decline  we anticipate a decline in net foreclosed property costs will follow 
please refer to the remaining sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for greater discussion of the various components of our performance  statement of financial condition and liquidity 
results of operations the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan and covered loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan and covered loan losses is primarily affected by changes in the loan portfolio s composition and performance  the identification of nonperforming loans and management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  based on loss experience as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of fee revenue from trust and investments  mortgage banking  capital markets products  treasury management  loan and credit related fees  and other services charges and fees 
net securities gains losses  if any  are also included in non interest income 
net interest income net interest income equals the excess of interest income including discount accretion or premium amortization on covered loans plus fees earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds  principally noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity  also support interest earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

compared to net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the year over year improvement in net interest income was primarily driven by million in higher loan income generated from million in higher average loan balances  which was partially offset by an million decrease due to downward pressure on loan yields 
loan yields were helped somewhat by a substantial decline in nonperforming loans 
declining balances and yields with respect to covered assets also offset the increase in net interest income compared to average investment securities balances increased million  contributing million to net interest income 
however  compared to the prior year  securities income declined by million  as the impact of the increase in average 
table of contents balances from the prior year was more than offset by declines in yields 
competitive pricing pressures  reductions in short term interest rates  and the re investment of maturing securities in the low interest rate environment led to the lower yields on both the loan and securities portfolios 
interest paid on interest bearing liabilities was reduced by million primarily due to lower funding costs as compared to the prior year  which was partially offset by million in interest expense related to the october million underwritten public offering of the company subordinated debentures issued as part of the redemption of tarp preferred stock 
net interest margin was for  a decline of seven basis points from for further downward pressure on primarily short term interest rates negatively impacted yields on loans and securities  which was partially offset by a decline in deposit costs of nine basis points  due to a shifting in the mix of deposits towards non interest bearing deposits and downward pricing from the prior year 
of our total loan balances  approximately are tied to variable interest rates 
a decline in short term borrowings interest expense of million year over year was more than offset by interest expense on the subordinated debt issued in october  which negatively impacts net interest income and would likely reduce net interest margin by approximately seven basis points on an annualized basis 
yield trends in both our loan and investment portfolios are likely to continue to pressure net interest margin given the current operating environment and the prospects for a continuation of low short term interest rates for some time 
our net interest margin has been affected by pricing compression resulting from competition in our target markets and to a lesser extent we have started to see pricing compression on loan renewals due to improved client financial condition  which will likely continue in competition is not only impacting loans to new clients  but also business that is being renewed with existing clients 
during the second half of  we maintained higher levels of liquidity due to client deposit flows and uncertainty over client response to the expiration of the unlimited deposit insurance for non interest bearing deposit accounts 
we have experienced some deposit outflows during the first quarter to date and have experienced a corresponding decline in liquid assets as well 
with respect to interest bearing liabilities  we do not anticipate any significant benefit to net interest margin in from downward pricing of deposits given the current level of interest rates 
compared to for  net interest margin was  an increase of basis points from for the improvement results from a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits  offset partially by a decrease in the yield on the investment portfolio 
also  the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio toward higher yielding commercial loans and some large non recurring loan fees increased the average interest rate earned on loans by two basis points 
along with the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to higher yielding commercial loans  the level of average nonperforming loans year over year was reduced by million  partially mitigating pricing compression experienced within the commercial loan portfolio as well as the million reduction in interest income on covered assets 
the lower interest rate environment negatively impacted the yield on the investment portfolio  resulting in a year over year reduction in interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million  despite the million increase in the average balance of total securities 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses  excluding the provision for covered loans  was million in  down from million in and million in the provision for loan losses is a function of our allowance for loan loss methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted 
the current year provision benefited from continuing improvement in asset quality  particularly the substantial decline in early stage problem loans 
in addition  the lower provision for loan loss was the result of the reduced requirement for specific reserves  and lower charge offs 
net charge offs were million in  compared to million in and million in for further analysis and information on how we determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses and analysis of credit quality  see critical accounting policies and credit quality management and allowance for loan losses 
provision for covered loan losses for  the provision for covered loan losses related to the loans purchased under the fdic assisted transaction loss share agreement totaled  compared to million in and million in the provision for covered loan losses represents the portion of expected losses on covered loans not reimbursed by the fdic

table of contents non interest income non interest income is derived from a number of sources related to our banking activities  including loan and credit related fees  the sale of derivative products to clients through our capital markets group  mortgage banking income  treasury management services  and fees from our trust and investments business 
the following table presents a break out of these multiple sources of revenue for the years ended december   and table non interest income analysis dollars in thousands year ended december  change trust and investments mortgage banking capital markets products treasury management loan and credit related fees loan  letter of credit and commitment fees syndication fees total loan and credit related fees deposit service charges and fees and other income subtotal fee revenue net securities losses gains total non interest income compared to non interest income for totaled million  increasing million  or compared to the prior year 
leading the improvement over the prior year was growth in mortgage banking income  capital markets products income  syndication fees and treasury management income 
these increases were partially offset by net securities losses in  compared to a large net securities gain in  as well as lower deposit service charges and fees and other income and trust and investments fees 
excluding net securities gains losses  non interest income grew by million  or  to million for  compared to million for trust and investments fee revenue declined by  or  from largely due to the loss of fees within the bank investment management subsidiary following the departure of two relationship managers in second quarter  the absence of larger estate fees recognized in the prior year  and to a lesser extent  the discontinuation of land trust fees due to the sale of the land trust business in and the impact of exiting certain non strategic relationships 
the loss in fees was partially offset by organic growth and continued client acquisition 
assets under management and administration auma grew to billion at december  from billion at december  primarily due to new custodial assets added in first quarter  net client growth  and to a lesser extent  improved market values 
the increase in custodial assets was largely attributable to a change in regulations requiring certain companies to use a qualified custodian  such as the bank  for the administration and custody of their clients assets 
fees earned on qualified custodian and escrow assets are typically a flat fee structure and are significantly lower than fees recognized on standard custody and managed assets  which are generally based on the market value of the assets on the last day of the prior quarter or month and are therefore subject to volatility 
custody assets as a percentage of total auma were and at december  and  respectively 
revenue from our mortgage banking business doubled from million in to million in during  the combination of the favorably low interest rate environment throughout the year and the expansion of our mortgage banking staff contributed to the revenue increase as a higher volume of transactions  primarily refinancing activity  were closed 
this resulted in a greater level of loans sold in the secondary market generating gains of million in compared to million in 
table of contents further  origination fees for were million higher than in with the low interest rates driving strong application volumes during the current year 
capital markets products income increased million from and included a  positive credit valuation adjustment cva compared to a negative cva of  for the cva represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client based derivatives and the related matched derivatives with interbank dealer counterparties 
exclusive of cva  capital markets products income increased million  or  compared to  and was favorably impacted by strong loan origination related swap activity that was generally characterized by longer durations and larger deal sizes  resulting in higher revenue compared to our capital markets business opportunities are sensitive to loan originations and our clients interest rate expectations 
treasury management income increased million  or  from revenue growth for these services is closely correlated with loan originations and the acquisition of new middle market lending clients  though often subject to a three to six month lag of implementation 
the current year increase reflects the ongoing success in cross selling treasury management services to new commercial clients as we continue to build client relationships and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in our earnings credit rate the rate applied to balances maintained in the client s deposit account to offset activity charges in the latter part of loan and credit related fees  excluding syndication fees  increased million  or  from  principally due to greater unused commitment fees 
unused commitment fees increased million from the prior year 
the majority of our unused commitment fees related to revolving facilities  which at december  totaled billion  of which billion were unused 
in comparison  at december   commitments related to revolving facilities totaled billion  of which billion were unused 
syndication fees increased million from to million in syndication fees tend to fluctuate period to period depending on client needs  market conditions  loan origination trends  internal growth targets and risk guidelines 
deposit service charges and fees and other income declined million  or  from primarily due to a decline in small business administration servicing and related fees  which fluctuate with loan demand  and a  reduction in card based interchange fees  which was attributable to new fee limits provided for under the dodd frank act 
also contributing to the year over year variance was  in higher gains on sale of various assets recognized in compared to non interest income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year  with all major categories  excluding mortgage banking and trust and investments  contributing to the year over year growth 
excluding securities gains  non interest income increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for trust and investments fee revenue declined by from during  we gained momentum in carrying out our strategic initiative to retool and enhance our wealth management business and services through the addition and expansion of new and existing clients 
however  trust and investments fee revenue for was impacted by certain nonrecurring larger estate fees recognized in the prior year period  lower retail tax preparation fees  lower fees from our land trust business  which was sold in early  and some client attrition 
also  during the past year  client portfolios were increasingly invested in mutual funds and etfs reducing reliance on third party managers 
accordingly  the fees collected for these investment management services decreased with a corresponding reduction to investment expenses compared to the prior year 
revenue from our mortgage banking business was lower by million  or  from the prior year  as experienced an extended period of lower mortgage interest rates and related higher refinancing activity as compared to in  significant refinancing application volume did not begin until the drop in interest rates later in the year  unlike the prior year 
capital markets products income increased million from and included a  negative cva compared to a negative cva of million for exclusive of cva  capital markets income increased to million in from million in  and was primarily attributable to increased client interest rate swap fees resulting from both loan originations and renewals  larger margin transactions in the current year  and higher foreign exchange revenue from increased transactions as part of our clients ongoing business activities  a small number of large transactions and increased volatility in foreign exchange markets 
treasury management income increased million  or  from the current year increase reflects ongoing success in cross selling treasury management services to new and existing commercial clients as well as the full year impact of new clients added during in addition  during  our earnings credit rate remained in line with market and deposit interest rates  declining slightly during the year and providing a small contribution to the overall increase in fees 

table of contents loan and credit related fees increased million  or  from and was principally due to a higher volume of syndication revenue driven by increased lead agency credits 
syndication fees tend to fluctuate period to period depending on client needs  market conditions  loan origination trends  internal growth targets and risk guidelines 
letter of credit and unused commitment fees were also higher in deposit service charges and fees and other income increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to  in gains on various asset dispositions in  including the sale of our land trust business earlier in the year   in losses in on loans held for sale  as well as additional income from small business administration servicing and related fees in as compared to the prior year

less than compared to non interest expense increased by million  or  for as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense and net foreclosed property expense  which was partially offset by lower insurance expense 

table of contents compensation expense increased overall by million  or  from salary and wages expenses were up million  or  primarily due to an increase in ftes since december   as well as annual compensation adjustments 
share based costs increased by million  or  as includes a full year of expense related to equity awards as well as ten months of expense recognition related to annual stock based awards issued in february as previously disclosed in our proxy statement  a greater number of shares were awarded in connection with our february incentive compensation awards than in the prior year largely because  in  we expanded to a larger employee population an incentive compensation deferral program 
under this deferral program  a portion of annual incentive compensation awards paid in were deferred in the form of time vested restricted stock 
also  at year end  the final tranche of equity awards originally issued in and under our transformational strategic growth plan vested resulting in an increase in expense from a truing up of estimated forfeitures 
the final vesting of these awards will result in a decline in share based costs in finally  share based costs had benefited from a higher level of forfeitures on departed plan participants 
incentive compensation  retirement costs and other employee benefits were up by million  or  compared to  principally due to higher incentive compensation related to the company performance against stated goals in addition to performance based pay linked to mortgage banking and capital markets fee revenues  which had higher revenues for as compared to  as presented in table technology and related costs increased million  or  compared to the prior year and was primarily due to investments in data networking to provide greater bandwidth and improve overall service levels  as well as higher volumes in transaction based data processing fees for client based loan  deposit and wire services 
marketing expenses increased million  or  compared to due largely to our new advertising program to raise our corporate profile in  as well as higher client development costs 
professional services expense  which includes fees paid for legal  accounting  and consulting services  declined  or  from  with reduced consultancy services and lower corporate legal fees driving the decline 
net foreclosed property expense  which includes write downs on foreclosed properties  gains and losses on sales of foreclosed properties  taxes  and other expenses associated with the maintenance of oreo  increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to higher valuation write downs  which totaled million for as compared to million for the prior year 
approximately half of valuation write downs in were associated with land parcels 
also  a higher amount of property ownership costs  such as property management and real estate taxes  were incurred in as compared to the prior year 
mitigating the impact of the higher valuation write downs and property ownership costs was a decrease in the net loss on sales of oreo 
net losses on sale were million on million of oreo in  as compared to net losses of million on million of oreo in as the number of oreo properties decline  we anticipate a decline in net foreclosed property costs will follow 
refer to the foreclosed real estate discussion in the loan portfolio and credit quality section below for more information regarding our oreo portfolio and valuation process 
insurance expense declined million  or  from  primarily due to lower deposit insurance assessments as a result of the change in fdic insurance methodology that became effective in april  including clarifying guidance provided in third quarter by the fdic that benefited the company 
the lower deposit insurance expense benefited from various improved metrics  including credit quality  deposit mix and improved liquidity under the new model 
the new assessment regulations modified the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to a risk assessed balance sheet model 
loan and collection expense  which consists of certain non reimbursable costs associated with performing loan activities and loan remediation costs of problem and nonperforming loans  declined million  or  from at december   performing loan costs represented of total loan and collection expense 
costs related to loan remediation activities decreased million  or  primarily due to the overall reduction in problem loans 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase of million in performing loan activities with of the increase representing non reimbursable mortgage origination costs in connection with greater re financing volumes 
other expenses increased million  or  from the prior year 
other expenses include various categories such as bank charges  costs associated with the cdars product offering  intangible asset amortization  education related costs  subscriptions  provision for unfunded commitments  and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the increase was primarily due to million in higher amortization on our core deposit intangible assets compared to the prior year 
in addition  we recorded a  provision for unfunded commitments in as compared to an  reduction of the reserve for unfunded commitments in 
table of contents compared to non interest expense totaled million for  increasing modestly by million  or  from million in despite a substantial increase in net foreclosed property expense  overall non interest expenses remained relatively flat year over year  reflecting ongoing cost control management 
compensation expense increased overall by million  or  from salary and wages were up largely due to annual merit  promotional and market adjustments and lower deferred salary costs related to origination expenses on a comparative basis  which was slightly offset by a small decline in the number of employees 
share based payment costs were down million primarily due to a higher level of forfeiture related expense reversals on departed and retiring plan participants during incentive compensation  retirement costs and other employee benefits were up by million compared to  reflecting higher incentive compensation expense in conjunction with the improved financial results of the company 
this increase was partially offset by the implementation of a new plan feature requiring a portion of the current year bonus for certain employees to be deferred over a future defined service period 
technology and related costs increased million  or  from due to various systems upgrades occurring during including our items processing platform and our data network 
professional services expense  decreased million  or  from the decrease is primarily due to higher prior year costs relating to risk management consultants  system conversion fees in connection with the integration of the fdic assisted acquisition of the former founders bank  and audit fees 
net foreclosed property expense increased million  or  from the increase in net foreclosed property expense is primarily due to higher net losses on the sale of oreo resulting from the accelerated pace of sales  as well as operating expenses relating to the million increase in oreo balances during and higher valuation write downs 
in  we incurred million in net losses on sale of oreo compared to million in also  oreo write downs totaled million for compared to million for the prior year 
insurance expense decreased million  or  from  primarily due to lower deposit insurance assessments as a result of the change in fdic insurance assessment methodology 
in  the fdic adopted final rules amending the deposit insurance assessment regulations  modifying  among other provisions  the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less average tangible equity 
these rules took effect april   impacting assessments beginning in the second quarter loan and collection expense decreased million  or  from largely due to a lower level of performing loan costs largely attributable to reduced refinance volumes on a comparative basis 
however  part of these reduced costs was offset by an increase in problem asset remediation expense 
other expenses decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to an  reduction of the reserve for unfunded commitments in  compared to a provision for unfunded commitments of million recorded in in addition  decreased volume and rates reduced cdars servicing fees by  from the prior year 

table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are presented in the following table 
table income tax provision analysis dollars in thousands year ended december  income before income tax provision income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate n m n m not meaningful generally  our effective income tax rate varies from the statutory federal income tax rate of principally due to state income taxes  the effects of tax exempt earnings from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance  non deductible compensation and business expenses and tax credits 
our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
for the year ended december  we recorded an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million equal to a effective tax rate compared to an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million for the year ended december  equal to a effective tax rate 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to the tax benefits totaling million included in the period attributable to the repricing of our deferred tax asset that resulted from the illinois corporate tax rate change 
in addition  the effective tax rate in was negatively impacted by reduced tax benefits relating to share based awards that were settled during the year 
the company does not currently expect its effective tax rate to be negatively impacted by the settlement of share based compensation awards of any material degree and as a result  is estimating an effective rate for of 
the effective tax rate in was not meaningful because the small amount of pre tax income caused the permanent differences described above to disproportionately impact the effective tax rate compared to what would have normally been expected 
realization of deferred tax assets net deferred tax assets are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and totaled million at december   consisting of gross deferred assets of million offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and no valuation allowance was recorded 
this conclusion was based in part on the fact that the company was not in a cumulative book loss position for financial statement purposes at december   measured on a trailing three year basis 
in addition  we considered our recent earnings history  on both a book and tax basis  and our outlook for earnings and taxable income in future periods 
taxable income in prior years and reversing deferred taxable income amounts provide sources from which deferred tax assets may be absorbed 
most significantly  however  we have relied on our expectation of generating pre tax earnings in future periods  which should give rise to taxable income levels  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  that more likely than not will be sufficient to absorb the deferred tax assets 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets that relate to equity compensation awards  including both unexercised stock options and unvested restricted shares 
in both cases  the deferred tax assets may not be fully realized in future periods primarily due to stock price valuation 
currently  most of our stock options are out of the money with an exercise price above our current stock price 
depending in part on changes in our stock price  we could incur tax charges at the expiration date of the options or prior to that time if employees terminate and out of the money options expire  or in certain instances  
table of contents when employees exercise options 
in the case of restricted shares  the tax benefits will not be fully realized if the fair market value of the awards on the vesting release date is less than the value of the awards on the grant date 
in such circumstances where there is a shortfall in tax benefits on the exercise  vesting or expiration of an equity award  such shortfall amounts are charged to stockholders equity if there is a sufficient level of excess tax benefits accumulated from prior years 
during and  such shortfall amounts charged to stockholders equity totaled million and million  respectively 
in addition  during and  we charged million and  respectively  of such shortfall tax benefits to income tax expense because the balance of cumulative prior year excess tax benefits was reduced to this resulted in an increase in the effective tax rate in and based on our current stock price level  scheduled vesting of restricted shares and anticipated option expirations  we do not expect to incur material shortfall tax charges in the amount of such shortfall charges in periods after will be dependent on changes in our stock price as well as the impact of employee terminations  option exercise decisions and other factors 
operating segments results we have three primary business segments banking  trust and investments  and holding company activities 
banking our banking segment is the company most significant segment  representing nearly of consolidated total assets and generates nearly all of the company net income

the net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  a million increase from net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income for the banking segment was primarily due to million in lower provision for loan and covered loan losses  which was partially offset by in higher non interest expense compared to the prior year 
net income for the banking segment increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december   which was primarily due to a million in lower provision for loan and covered loan losses offset by higher non interest expense compared to the prior year

net income attributable to controlling interests from trust and investments increased to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and increased from a net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net income from to is primarily attributable to million lower non interest expense 
auma was billion at december  and billion at december  organizational changes at lodestar in connection with a strategic repositioning led to the departure of two relationship managers resulting in a decline in both fee revenue and non interest expense in holding company activities the holding company activities segment consists of parent company only activity and intersegment eliminations 
the holding company s most significant asset is its investment in its bank subsidiary 
undistributed earnings relating to this investment is not included in the holding company financial results 
holding company financial results are represented primarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses 
recurring operating expenses consist primarily of share based compensation and professional fees 
the holding company activities segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in and a net loss of million for the increase is due to million in interest expense from subordinated debentures issued in october the holding company had million in cash at december  compared to million at december  on october   the company repurchased all of the million of its preferred stock held by the us treasury and remitted million in accrued and unpaid dividends using the proceeds from its october million common equity offering and

financial condition investment portfolio management we manage our investment portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines  to meet pledging and liquidity requirements  and to adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity to attempt to serve as some protection of net interest income levels against the impact of changes in interest rates 
we may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors  including expected liquidity needs  the current and forecasted interest rate environment  our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate  the relative value of various segments of the securities markets  and the broader economic and regulatory environment 
investments are comprised of debt securities 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of residential mortgage backed pools  collateralized mortgage obligations  and state and municipal bonds 
debt securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of our asset liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities represent the difference between the aggregated cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported  on an after tax basis  as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
this balance sheet component will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change  with such changes affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio 
in periods of significant market volatility we may experience significant changes in aoci 
aoci is not currently included in the calculation of regulatory capital but its inclusion is contemplated in the proposed changes in capital standards 
refer to proposed changes to regulatory capital rules under the capital discussion further in this document for additional information 
debt securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity and are accounted for using historical cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts

these loans tend to be larger extensions of credit and are primarily to for profit businesses 
a significant source of revenue for these borrowers is reimbursements from federal and state agencies which from time to time delay and or change reimbursement payments

delinquency can be driven by either failure of the borrower to make payments within the term of the loan or failure to make the final payment at maturity 
the majority of our loans are not fully amortizing over the term 
as a result  a sizeable final repayment is often required at maturity 
if a borrower lacks refinancing options or the ability to pay  the loan may become delinquent in connection with its maturity 
table provides information on current  delinquent and nonaccrual loans by product type 
of total commercial  commercial real estate and construction loans outstanding at december   million are scheduled to mature in the first quarter of  of which were nonperforming at december  loans considered special mention are performing in accordance with the contractual terms but demonstrate potential weakness that if left unresolved  may result in deterioration in the company s credit position and or the repayment prospects for the credit 
borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends  high leverage  tight liquidity  or other credit concerns 
these loans continue to accrue interest 
potential problem loans  like special mention  are loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms  but for which management has some level of concern greater than that of special mention loans about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods 
these loans continue to accrue interest but the ultimate collection of these loans is questionable due to the same conditions that characterize a special mention credit 
these credits may also have somewhat increased risk profiles as a result of the current net worth and or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or the collateral pledged 
these loans generally have a well defined weakness that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved 
although potential problem loans require additional attention by management  they may never become nonperforming 
special mention and potential problem loans as of december  and are presented in table 
table of contents nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and are awaiting disposition and are presented in table nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  including restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual 
we specifically exclude certain restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans if the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the new terms of the restructuring as evidenced by a minimum of six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrower s performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring supports returning or maintaining the loan on accrual status 
restructured loans that are accruing interest are also included in table all loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become days past due or earlier if management deems the collectibility of the principal or interest to be in question prior to the loans becoming days past due 
when interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is reversed reducing interest income 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded in the financial statements as a reduction of principal  and interest income is only recorded on a cash basis if the remaining recorded investment after charge offs is deemed fully collectible 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal and or interest 
nonperforming loans are presented in tables    and foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans secured by a mortgage on real property 
foreclosed assets are recorded at the lesser of current carrying value or estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
on a periodic basis  the carrying values of these properties are adjusted based upon new appraisals and or market indications 
write downs are recorded for subsequent declines in net realizable value and are included in non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
additional information on our oreo assets is presented in tables through as part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances  we may extend or modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties 
the modification may consist of reduction in interest rate  extension of the maturity date  reduction in the principal balance  or other action intended to minimize potential losses that would otherwise not be considered in order to improve the chance of a more successful recovery on the loan 
such concessions as part of a modification are accounted for as trouble debt restructurings tdrs 
restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual  moving to nonaccrual  or continuing on accrual status  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
tdrs accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions  has historically demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms  and management is reasonably assured as to the collectibility of principal and interest  otherwise  the restructured loan will be classified as nonaccrual 
the composition of our restructured loans accruing interest by loan category  current period activity and stratification is presented in table   and as part of our restructuring strategies  we may utilize a multiple note structure as a workout alternative for certain loans 
the multiple note structure typically bifurcates a troubled loan into two separate notes  where the first note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to the modified terms  and the second note of the troubled loan that is not reasonably assured of repayment is charged off 
aside from the decision to restructure a loan  thereby increasing our outstanding tdrs  changes in the level of tdrs from period to period may be impacted by both favorable and unfavorable developments associated with the respective tdr 
favorable developments include payoffs at par  paydowns of principal earlier than expected and regular amortizing payments 
in addition  certain tdrs may be subsequently re underwritten as pass rated credits  which is evidence that the borrower would no longer be considered troubled and  accordingly  the tdr classification is removed 
unfavorable developments include performance deterioration in the borrower operations  which can cause the loan classification to be changed to nonperforming and removed from the accruing tdr portfolio 
our results reflect meaningful progress in improving overall asset quality 
nonperforming assets declined to million at december  from million at december   reflecting the continued progress in improving the overall asset quality of the portfolio and reducing problem assets 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   down from at december  nonperforming loans totaled million at december   down from million at december   with improvements in all product categories  in particular the commercial real estate segment 
nonperforming loan inflows  which are primarily comprised of potential problem loans moving through the workout process ie  moving from potential problem to nonperforming status  declined from as shown in table  inflows to nonperforming loans in were more than offset by problem loan resolutions paydowns  payoffs and return to accruing status  dispositions  and charge offs 
as shown in table  which provides the nonperforming loan stratification by size  five nonperforming loans in excess of million comprised of our total nonperforming loans at december  
table of contents oreo declined million  or  from december   as inflows to oreo were more than offset by sales of oreo  with a net book value of million and million of valuation adjustments 
inflows to oreo from nonperforming loans declined as compared to the prior year 
refer to foreclosed real estate below for further discussion on oreo 
during  we used a variety of resolution strategies  including asset sales  which reduced special mention  potential problem loan and nonperforming assets from year end 
disposition activity during the year ended december  included the sale of million in problem assets  including million in nonperforming loans  million in early stage problem loans  and million in oreo at an incremental charge of based on the carrying value net of specific reserves at the time of disposition 
our asset management activities  along with a slowly improving economy and some asset price stability in certain market segments  have led to declines in problem loans which include special mention  potential problem  and nonperforming loans of  from million at december  to million at december  we have been generally consistent in our principal approach to disposing distressed assets  typically utilizing direct sales to end users or other parties interested in particular assets 
we source dispositions opportunistically  limiting the use of brokered or pooled transactions 
accruing tdrs totaled million at december   decreasing million  or  from million at december  as presented in the accruing tdr rollforward at table  new accruing tdrs totaling million during were more than offset by accruing tdrs moving to nonperforming status  paydowns and payoffs  and accruing tdrs that were subsequently re underwritten as pass rated credits and removed from the tdr portfolio 
because our loan portfolio contains loans that may be larger in size in order to accommodate the financing needs of some of our borrowers  the movement of one or more of these loans to a different performance classification can create volatility in our credit quality metrics  including nonperforming loans and accruing tdr loans as discussed above 
as problem loan indicators and problem asset resolution continue to trend positively  we expect further improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio 
however  because many of our potential problem loans are commercial real estate related  still a relatively stressed loan sector  and because the potential problem loan population contains some larger sized credits  our total nonperforming loans and nonperforming loan inflows may fluctuate over the next several quarters as we continue to execute remediation plans and work through the credit cycle 
in addition  credit quality trends may also be impacted by uncertainty in global economic conditions and market turmoil that could disrupt workout plans  adversely affect clients  or negatively impact collateral valuations 
nonperforming asset levels and levels of restructured loans could fluctuate depending on the mix and timing of dispositions or other remediation actions 
we continue to focus on improving asset quality and expect lower nonperforming assets as we move through our efforts to continue to dispose of nonperforming assets and problem loans in future quarters may be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to  the pace and timing of the overall recovery of the economy  activity levels in the real estate market and real estate inventory coming into the market for sale 
we continue to assess the disposition market  seeking to maximize liquidation proceeds of the individual assets sold 
we will also continue to use various other strategies mentioned above  including restructuring  that are consistent with our goal of maximizing economic recovery on the asset

credit quality management and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance is not a prediction of our actual credit losses going forward 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired the specific component of the allowance  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general allocated component of the allowance  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors and management judgment applied to defined segments of our loan portfolio 

table of contents the specific component of the allowance relates to impaired loans 
impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans which include nonaccrual tdrs and loans classified as accruing tdrs 
a loan is considered nonaccrual when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all loans that are over days past due in principal or interest are by definition considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual status 
management may also place some loans on nonaccrual status before they are days past due if they meet the above definition of impaired 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the loan s observable fair value  the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent  or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
impaired loans exceeding  are evaluated individually while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience as well as management s loss expectations for the respective asset class and product type 
if the estimated fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan including accrued interest  net of deferred loan fees and costs and unamortized premium or discount  impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
the recognition of any reserve required on new impaired loans is recorded in the same quarter in which the transfer of the loan to nonaccrual status occurred 
all impaired loans are reviewed quarterly for any changes that would affect the specific reserve 
any impaired loan in which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination has been made 
when collateral dependent loans are determined to be impaired  updated appraisals for loans in excess of  are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally by our appraisal department at least every six months 
additional diligence procedures are conducted on any appraisal with a value in excess of  but less than  upon request only and a technical review is required on appraisals with a value in excess of million 
in addition to the appraisal  both borrower and market specific factors are taken into consideration  which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisal updates or internal assessments 
appraisals are conducted by third party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement 
appraisals are either reviewed internally by our appraisal department or are sent to an outside firm if appropriate 
both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and risk associated with the loan and its collateral 
as part of our internal review process  we consider other factors or recent developments that could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews 
to validate the reasonableness of the appraisals obtained  we may consider many factors  including a comparison of the appraised value to the actual sales prices of similar properties  relevant comparable sale prices listings  broker opinions  and local or regional real estate valuation and sales data 
as of december   the average appraisal age used in the impaired loan valuation process was approximately days 
the amount of impaired assets which  by policy  requires an independent appraisal  but does not have a current external appraisal at year end due to the timing of the receipt of the appraisal is not material 
in situations such as this  we establish a probable impairment reserve for the account based on our experience in the related asset class and type 
the general allocated component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio 
the methodology takes into account at a product level the originating line of business transformational or legacy  the year of origination  the risk rating migration of the loans  and historical default and loss history of similar products 
using this information  the methodology produces a range of possible reserve estimates by product type 
we consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or time frames not captured by the model as well as market and economic data and management judgment 
we consider relevant factors related to individual product types and will also consider  when appropriate  changes in lending practices  changes in business or economic conditions  changes in the nature and volume of loans  changes in staffing or management  changes in the quality of our results from loan reviews  changes in collateral values  concentration risks  and other external factors such as legal or regulatory matters relevant to management assessment of required reserve levels 
in certain instances  these additional factors and judgments may lead to management s conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determined through the framework with respect to a given product type 
in our evaluation of the quantitatively determined range and the adequacy of the allowance at december   we considered a number of factors for each product that included  but were not limited to  the following for the commercial portfolio  the pace of growth in the commercial loan sector  the existence of larger individual credits and specialized industry concentrations  the average age of the loans in the portfolio  comparison of our default rates to overall us industry averages at industry subsets  default emergence from recent years compared to earlier  more stressed periods  results of back testing of model results versus actual recent charge off history  and general macroeconomic indicators  such as gdp and employment trends  and manufacturing activity  which still are susceptible to sustainability risk  for the commercial real estate portfolio  the potential impact of general commercial real estate trends  particularly occupancy and leasing rate trends  charge off severity  default likelihood in our portfolio versus the general us averages  default emergence from recent years compared to earlier  more stressed periods  results of back testing of model results versus recent charge off history  collateral value changes and the impact that a negative general 
table of contents macroeconomic condition would have on this sector  for the construction portfolio  construction employment and activity  industry experience on construction loan losses  and construction spending rates  and for the residential  home equity  and personal portfolios  home price indices and sales volume  vacancy rates  delinquency rates  and general economic conditions and interest rate trends which impact these products 
in determining our december  reserve levels  we established a general reserve level which was at the high end of the quantitative range 
this judgment was influenced primarily by limited seasoning in our transformational commercial and transformational commercial real estate portfolios  industry wide performance which suggested higher default rates on commercial loans than we have experienced  exposure to the negative impacts of land valuation  which have continued to exhibit stress  a slow pace of recovery in the commercial real estate market  ongoing economic uncertainty and the susceptibility to continued economic downturn and loan concentrations in our commercial portfolio 
management also considers the amount and characteristics of the accruing tdrs removed from the general allocation reserve formulas in establishing final reserve requirements 
the bank has limited exposure with a related junior collateral position in any product type with the exception of home equity lines of credit helocs 
this product is by definition usually secured in the junior position to the first mortgage on the related property 
the bank evaluates the allowance for loan losses for helocs as one of our six primary  segregated product types and considers the potential impact of the junior security position as opposed to our generally senior position in all other product types in setting final allocated reserve amounts for this product 
our allowance reflects the performance and loss history unique to our portfolio 
the establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and includes an inherent level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses actually occur 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including  but not limited to  client performance  the economy  changes in interest rates and property values  and regulatory mandated credit actions  if any 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important credit management tool  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reviews the allowance for loan losses and the underlying methodology with the audit committee of the board of directors quarterly 
as of december   management concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate ie  sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio at that date  including those loans not yet identifiable 
as an integral part of their examination process  various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require that certain loans be classified by rating differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

the allowance for loan losses declined million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in the allowance reflects the overall improvement in asset quality  reduced reserve requirements on a declining level of impaired loans which require a specific reserve  and lower charge offs 
as a result of these factors  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  declined to million compared to million for the prior year 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december   down from as of december  there is no assurance that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will continue to decline in future periods

in addition  lower loss rates are being applied to a larger portion of the total loan portfolio as the portfolio is becoming more weighted in transformational and commercial loans  where our historical credit performance has been better  albeit less seasoned  and less weighted in legacy and commercial real estate loans  where historical performance has been weaker 
this changing mix has resulted in lower loss rates applied to a larger portion of the total loan portfolio which positively impacts reserve requirements 
the improvement in the asset quality position of the loan portfolio as of december  as compared to december  supports a lower general reserve 
specific component of the allowance at december   the specific component of the allowance decreased by million to million from million at december  as a result of the declining impaired loan population 
the specific reserve requirements are the summation of individual reserves analyzed on an account by account basis at the balance sheet date on impaired loans  as well as changes to collateral values 
our impaired loans are primarily collateral dependent with such loans totaling million of the total million in impaired loans at december  in comparison  at december   collateral dependent impaired loans totaled million of total impaired loans of million 

table of contents reserve for unfunded commitments in addition to the allowance for loan losses  we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities 
at december   our reserve for unfunded commitments remained relatively stable  increasing  from december  to million 
net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
unfunded commitments  excluding covered assets  totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
at december   unfunded commitments with maturities of less than one year approximated billion 
for further information on our unfunded commitments  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
covered assets covered assets represent purchased loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under a loss sharing agreement with the fdic as a result of the fdic assisted acquisition of the former founders bank from the fdic 
under the loss share agreement  generally the fdic will assume of the first million of credit losses and of the credit losses in excess of million  in both cases relating to assets that existed on the date of acquisition 
the loss share agreement expires on september  for non single family homes and september  for single family homes

in addition  the estimated loss reimbursement by the fdic the fdic indemnification receivable further contributed to the reduction as a result of loss claims paid by the fdic 
the allowance for covered loan losses declined by million to million at december  from million at december   due to impaired loans charge offs and migration of impaired loans to oreo on certain pools of covered loans 
as of december   the fdic had reimbursed the company million in losses under the loss share agreement 

table of contents the following table presents covered loan delinquencies and nonperforming covered assets as of december  and and excludes purchased impaired loans which are accounted for on a pool basis 
since each purchased impaired pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows  the past due status of the pools  or that of individual loans within the pools  is not meaningful 
because we are recognizing interest income on each pool of such loans  they are all considered to be performing 
covered assets are excluded from the asset quality presentation of our originated loan portfolio  given the loss share indemnification from the fdic

we also have in place contingency funding plans designed to allow us to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained 
as part of our asset liability management strategy  we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk  cost  liquidity risk and contingency planning 
the bank s principal sources of funds are client deposits  including large institutional deposits  brokered time deposits  wholesale borrowings  and cash from operations 
the bank s principal uses of funds include funding growth in the core asset portfolios  including loans  and to a lesser extent  our investment portfolio  which is used primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
the primary sources of funding for the holding company include dividends when received from its bank subsidiary  intercompany tax reimbursements from the bank  and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt  as well as equity 
net liquid assets at the holding company totaled million at december  and million at december  in october  we redeemed all of the preferred stock held by the us treasury of million and remitted million in accrued and unpaid dividends using the net proceeds from our october million common equity offering and million subordinated debenture offering  together with existing cash resources 
we consider client deposits our core funding source 
at december  and  of our total assets were funded by client deposits 
we define client deposits as all deposits other than traditional brokered time deposits and non client cdars as described in the footnotes to table below 
while we expect overall liquidity in the banking system to remain high while economic recovery and market factors improve  the level of our client deposits may fluctuate significantly based on client needs  seasonality and other economic  market or regulatory factors  including deposit insurance limits 
if client deposits decline due to any of these factors  we would expect to utilize other external sources of liquidity  including wholesale funding 
given the commercial focus of our core business strategy  a majority of our deposit base is comprised of corporate accounts which are typically larger than retail accounts 
we have built a suite of deposit and cash management products and services that support our efforts to attract and retain corporate client accounts  resulting in a concentration of large deposits in our funding base 
we take deposit concentration risk into account in managing our liquid asset levels 
liquid assets refer to cash on hand  federal funds sold and securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of such assets pledged to secure public funds  certain deposits that require collateral and for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
net liquid assets at the bank were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we had higher net liquid assets at the bank during the second half of in part due to an increase in client deposits that can be typical towards year end and 
table of contents uncertainty relating to the potential for deposit outflows resulting from the expiration of the unlimited fdic deposit insurance on noninterest bearing deposit accounts at december  consistent with the activity seen in the first quarter  we have experienced some deposit outflows during the first quarter to date and have experienced a corresponding decline in liquid assets as well 
we maintain liquidity at levels we believe sufficient to meet anticipated client liquidity needs  fund anticipated loan growth  selectively purchase securities and investments  and opportunistically pay down wholesale funds 
while we first look toward internally generated deposits as our funding source  we also utilize wholesale funding  including brokered time deposits  as needed to enhance liquidity and to fund asset growth 
brokered time deposits are deposits that are sourced from external and unrelated financial institutions by a third party 
brokered time deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer term funding 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered time deposits  excluding client cdars  to levels no more than of total deposits  and total brokered time deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
brokered time deposits exclusive of client cdars were of total deposits at december   compared to less than at december  our cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities primarily include results of operations for the year  adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash 
net cash provided by operating activities declined by million from to million for cash flows from investing activities reflect the impact of loans and investments acquired for our interest earning asset portfolios and asset sales 
for  net cash used in investing activities was billion  compared to million for the prior year 
this change in cash flows represents larger amounts of cash redeployed towards the funding of loans in than the prior year 
cash flows from financing activities include transactions and events whereby cash is obtained from and or paid to depositors  creditors or investors 
net cash provided by financing activities for was billion  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the prior year 
this change in cash flows primarily represents the increased level of client deposits in the current year as compared to the prior year 
for information regarding our investment portfolio  see the investment portfolio management section above 
deposits the primary source of our deposit base is middle market commercial client relationships from a diversified industry base in our markets 
due to our middle market commercial banking focused business model  our client deposit base provides access to larger deposit balances that result in a concentrated deposit base

these deposits are classified as brokered time deposits for regulatory deposit purposes  however  we classify certain of these deposits as client cdars due to the source being our client relationships and are  therefore  not traditional brokered time deposits 
we also participate in a non client cdars program that is more like a traditional brokered time deposit program 
total deposits  net of traditional brokered time deposits and non client cdars

client deposits as a percentage of total deposits declined from almost all deposits at december  to at december  brokered time deposits totaled million at december   up million from december  brokered time deposits fluctuate based upon the bank general funding needs related to deposit  loans and other funding needs 
we increased our use of brokered deposits from last year as the pricing and term of these deposits provided the best replacement funding source for million in maturing fhlb borrowings 
we are a member of the fhlb chicago  and fhlb borrowings are a key funding source of the company 
we discuss fhlb borrowings in greater detail in the following short term borrowings and long term debt section of this document 
brokered time deposits at december  included million in client related cdars 
brokered time deposits  excluding client cdars  increased by million from the prior year end and were of total deposits at december  compared to less than at december  public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities  are included as a part of our total deposits 
we enter into specific agreements with certain public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
these relationships may provide cross sell opportunities with treasury management  as well as other business referral opportunities 
at december   we had public funds on account totaling million  of which approximately were collateralized with securities 
year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

over the past several years in the generally low interest rate environment  our clients have tended to keep the maturities of their deposits short  and short term certificates of deposit have generally been renewed on terms and with maturities of similar duration 
in the event that time deposits are not renewed  we expect to replace those deposits with traditional deposits  brokered time deposits  or borrowed money sufficient to meet our funding needs 
short term borrowings and long term debt short term borrowings  which at december  and consisted solely of fhlb advances that mature in one year or less  decreased by million to million from million at december  we may continue to use fhlb advances to meet our funding needs  although  as we did during  we may chose to use brokered deposits as an alternative depending on cost and certain other factors

in addition to on balance sheet funding and other liquid assets such as cash and investment securities  we maintain access to various external sources of funding  which assist in the prudent management of funding costs  interest rate risk  and anticipated funding needs or other considerations 
some sources of funding are accessible same day while others require advance notice 
funds that are immediately accessible include federal fund counterparty lines  which are uncommitted lines of credit from other financial institutions  and the borrowing term is typically overnight 
availability of federal fund lines fluctuate based on market conditions and counterparty relationship strength 
unused overnight fed funds borrowings available for use totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we also had borrowing capacity of billion with the fhlb chicago at december   of which million was available subject to the availability of acceptable collateral to pledge 
this borrowing source may be utilized by the bank for short term funding needs  including overnight advances as well as long term funding needs 
repurchase agreements repos are also an immediate source of funding in which we pledge assets to a counterparty against which we can borrow with the agreement to repurchase at a specified date in the future 
repos can vary in term  from overnight to longer  but are regarded as short term in nature 
the discount window at the frb is an additional source of overnight funding 
we maintain access to the discount window by pledging loans as collateral to the frb 
funding availability is primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged  but also impacted 
table of contents by the margin applied to the loans by the frb 
the amount of loans pledged to the frb can fluctuate due to the availability of loans eligible under the frb s criteria which include stipulations of documentation requirements  credit quality  payment status and other criteria

contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through our normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to the funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval processes as funded loans

purchase obligations exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
our operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities  equipment  and certain software or data processing 

table of contents purchase obligations at december  reflected the minimum obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable 
our purchase obligations included payments under  among other things  consulting  outsourcing  data  advertising  sponsorships  software license and telecommunications 
purchase obligations also included the estimated aggregate cash severance amounts that would be due to employees under employment contracts and arrangements  assuming all employees with such arrangements were involuntarily terminated on december  our commitments to fund community investments totaled million  which represent future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low income housing  small business real estate  and historic tax credit projects that qualify for cra purposes 
these commitments are not included in the contractual obligations table above  as the timing and amounts are based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project s partnership or operating agreement and could change due to variances in the construction schedule  project revisions  or the cancellation of the project 
our civic contribution commitments are also not included in the table 
as of december   the company had unrecognized tax benefits exclusive of net interest expense accruals that would favorably impact the effective tax rate by  if recognized in future periods 
because the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information and disclosure related to uncertain tax positions 
capital equity totaled billion at december   decreasing million compared to billion at december  the current year decrease was attributable to the repayment of million in preferred stock to the us treasury and was partially offset by the net proceeds of a million common stock issuance and net income reported in capital issuances and preferred stock redemption in contemplation of redeeming all of the million of its preferred stock held by the us treasury that was originally issued in under the us treasury tarp cpp  on october   the company raised million in net proceeds after deduction of underwriters discounts and offering expenses of new common equity through the issuance of  shares of voting common stock in an underwritten public offering with an offering price of per share 
on october   the company used these proceeds  along with net proceeds from a million debt offering and existing cash resources  to repurchase all of the preferred stock issued to the us treasury 
dividends of million were paid to the us treasury on october  when the preferred stock was repurchased 
we paid total dividends to the us treasury of million since issuance of the preferred shares in with million paid in in connection with the repurchase of the preferred stock  the company accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the preferred stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of million 
this resulted in a one time  non cash reduction in net income available to common stockholders and a decrease to basic and diluted earnings per share 
on november   the company repurchased in full the warrant that was issued to the us treasury in connection with the preferred stock investment at a mutually agreed upon price of million 
following the settlement of the warrant  the us treasury has no remaining stake in the company 
we did not have any common or preferred stock offerings in either or dividends we declared dividends of per common share during  unchanged from based on the closing stock price at december  of  the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was

table of contents stock repurchases we currently do not have a stock repurchase program in place  however  we have repurchased shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans 
under the terms of these plans  we accept shares of common stock from plan participants if they elect to surrender previously owned shares upon exercise of options to cover the exercise price or  in the case of both restricted shares of common stock or stock options  the withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares or exercise of stock options 
during  we repurchased  shares with an average value of per share 
capital management under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines  including the leverage ratio which is tier capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets  and the tier capital ratio and the total capital ratio each as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories 
these minimum ratios are shown in the table below 
to satisfy safety and soundness standards  banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet  regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities and plans 
during  we amended our capital management policy taking into account our improved earnings and asset quality  the proposed capital rules as further discussed in the following proposed changes to regulatory capital rules section  and the recently adopted regulatory stress testing requirements 
under our capital management policy  we conduct periodic stress testing of our capital adequacy and target capital ratios at levels above regulatory minimums that we believe are appropriate based on various other risk considerations  including the current operating and economic environment and outlook  internal risk guidelines  and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations

n a not applicable as discussed above  in october  the company repurchased all of its preferred stock held by the us treasury which had qualified as tier capital 
replacing  in part  the loss of the preferred stock from tier capital is the million in net proceeds from the common stock offering  which qualifies as tier capital along with the million of subordinated debentures offering  which qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
while the overall effect of the preferred stock redemption was a lowering of all of the company regulatory capital ratios  we believe these modestly lower ratios still provide sufficient excess capital over regulatory mandated levels and internal guidelines  particularly in light of the company improved earnings and asset quality profile 
in addition  the transactions resulted in an overall increase in common equity related capital ratios which we believe are the most meaningful measures of capital sufficiency 
as of december   all of our million of outstanding junior subordinated debentures debentures held by trusts that issued trust preferred securities are included in tier capital 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital as defined under frb regulations

table of contents proposed changes to regulatory capital rules in june  us banking regulators released notices of proposed rulemaking that would revise and replace the agencies current regulatory capital requirements to align with the basel iii international capital standards and to implement certain changes required by the dodd frank act 
the proposal is generally expected to require us banks to hold higher amounts of capital  especially common equity  against their risk weighted assets 
the proposal changes the treatment of certain assets for purposes of calculating regulatory capital and revises the regulatory minimums  establishes a required capital conservation buffer and adopts a more conservative calculation of risk weighted assets 
the proposal would  among other things  phase out trust preferred securities as a component of tier capital and would include unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities available for sale as a component of tier capital 
risk weighted assets would be calculated using new and expanded risk weighting categories 
among other categories  banking institutions would be required to assign higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans  past due or nonaccrual loans  certain residential mortgages  unfunded commitments of less than one year and portions of deferred tax assets exceeding certain limits 
the proposal provides for the following heightened capital requirements on a fully phased in basis common equity tier capital to total risk weighted assets of plus a capital conservation buffer of  tier capital to total risk weighted assets of plus a capital conservation buffer of  total capital to total risk weighted assets of plus a capital conservation buffer of  and tier capital to adjusted average total assets leverage ratio of 
under the proposal  if banking organizations fail to maintain capital ratios in excess of the requirements including the capital conservation buffer  they would be subject to limitations on payment of dividends  capital repurchases and payment of discretionary executive compensation 
the proposal also changes the minimum tier capital thresholds for purposes of the existing prompt corrective action framework 
if adopted  we will be subject to and impacted by many of the provisions in the proposal 
given our predominantly commercial business mix and limited residential mortgage exposure  we believe the impact of the changes as currently proposed to be implemented over a multi year phase in period will be manageable for us based on our expectation that we will continue to generate capital organically through earnings and through the release of capital from further reductions in our nonperforming assets 
in evaluating the potential impact of the proposal on us  we have focused primarily on the following based on december  results  our aoci would be additive to capital under the proposed rules  although aoci will fluctuate as current market interest rates and conditions change perhaps significantly during periods of market volatility 
the tier capital treatment of our existing million in trust preferred securities would be phased out over years which we believe provides us adequate time to appropriately manage any needed restructuring of capital 
the phased out portion of our trust preferred securities would continue to qualify as tier capital 
the proposal provides for an increased risk weighting on unfunded commitments of less than one year from zero percent to percent 
the proposal provides for an increased risk weighting on certain non performing loans from percent to percent 
the proposal provides for an increased risk weighting from percent to percent on certain commercial real estate exposures that are considered high volatility commercial real estate hvcre loans under the proposal 
we expect that our construction loans and certain of our commercial real estate loans would likely be considered hvcre loans as proposed 
additional analysis is necessary to estimate what portion of our commercial real estate loans would meet the hvcre definition pending further clarification of the proposal 
the proposal provides for a widening of the risk weighting range on certain residential real estate and home equity loans from a range of to percent to a range of percent to percent 
previously the proposals provided for implementation of the new capital requirements over a period of time commencing on january   with full phase in of most aspects to occur by the us regulators delayed the january implementation date  however  and the timing remains unclear 
until the proposals are finalized  and the timing of the implementation of the new rules is determined  the ultimate impact of such rules on us  and the banking industry generally  remains uncertain

under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
for analysis of our sensitivity to changes in interest rates  refer to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section at item a of this form k 
non us gaap financial measures this report contains both us gaap and us gaap based financial measures 
these non us gaap financial measures include net interest income  net interest margin  net revenue  operating profit  and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable equivalent basis  tier common equity to risk weighted assets  tangible common equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to risk weighted assets  tangible equity to tangible assets  and tangible book value 
we believe that presenting these non us gaap financial measures will provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance  our business  and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry 
we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest income earned on tax exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a tax rate 
management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhances comparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources  and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes 
in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators  we also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy  including tier common equity to risk weighted assets  tangible common equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to tangible assets  tangible equity to risk weighted assets  and tangible book value 
these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes 
all of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles while certain of these ratios exclude preferred capital components 
because us gaap does not include capital ratio measures  we believe there are no comparable us gaap financial measures to these ratios 
we believe these non us gaap financial measures are relevant because they provide information that is helpful in assessing the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions 
additionally  presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other companies 
however  because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios  our calculations may not be comparable with other companies  and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited 
non us gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although these non us gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under us gaap 
as a result  we encourage readers to consider our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure

critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements of item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are 
table of contents valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and fair value measurements are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time 
the allowance consists of reserves for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships that are individually evaluated for impairment the specific component  as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are not specifically identified the general allocated component  which is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors applied to segments of our loan portfolio as well as management s judgment 
the specific component relates to impaired loans 
impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans which include nonaccrual tdrs and loans classified as accruing tdrs 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the loan s observable fair value  fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs  if the loan is collateral dependent  or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by creating a specific valuation reserve as a component of the allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans exceeding  are evaluated individually  while loans less than  are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience  as well as management s loss expectations  for the respective asset class and product type 
of total impaired loans of million at december   had balances in excess of all impaired loans and their related reserves are reviewed and updated each quarter 
any impaired loan for which a determination has been made that the economic value is permanently reduced is charged off against the allowance for loan losses to reflect its current economic value in the period in which the determination is made 
at the time a collateral dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired  we review the existing collateral appraisal 
if the most recent appraisal is greater than one year old  a new appraisal is obtained on the underlying collateral 
the company generally obtains as is appraisal values for use in the evaluation of collateral dependent impaired loans 
appraisals for loans in excess of  are updated with a new independent appraisal at least annually and are formally reviewed by our internal appraisal department upon receipt of a new appraisal as well as at the six month interval between the independent appraisals 
if during the course of the six month review process there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral  the appraised value is either internally adjusted downward or a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan 
with an immaterial number of exceptions  all appraisals and internal reviews are current under this methodology at december  to determine the general allocated component of the allowance for loan losses  we segregate loans by originating line of business  vintage transformational and legacy  and product type eg commercial  commercial real estate because of observable similarities in the performance experience of loans underwritten by these business units 
in general  loans originated by the business units that existed prior to the strategic changes of the company in are considered legacy loans 
loans originated by a business unit that was established in connection with or following the strategic business transformation plan are considered transformational loans 
renewals or restructurings of legacy loans may continue to be evaluated as legacy loans depending on the structure or defining characteristics of the new transaction 
the company has implemented a line of business model that has reorganized the legacy business units so that after  all new loan originations are considered transformational 
the methodology produces an estimated range of potential loss exposure for the product types within each originating line of business 
we consider the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve within these ranges based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors to reflect data or timeframes not captured by the basic allowance framework as well as market and economic data and management judgment 
in certain instances  these additional factors and judgments may lead management to conclude that the appropriate level of the reserve is outside the range determined through the basic allowance framework 

table of contents determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  risk ratings  product type  and vintage  and consideration of current economic trends and portfolio attributes  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
for instance  loss rates in our allowance methodology typically reflect the company s more recent loss experience  by product  on a trailing twelve or eighteen month basis 
these loss rates consider both cumulative charge offs to date and oreo valuation adjustments in the individual product categories that constitute our allowance 
default estimates use a multi year cumulative calculation of defaults by originating line of business  vintage and rating 
in addition  we compare current model derived and historically established reserve levels to recent charge off trends and history in considering the appropriate final level of reserve at each product level 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses  which is a charge against earnings  is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the acquisition method of accounting 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
goodwill is allocated to reporting units at acquisition 
the company has two reporting units with allocated goodwill banking and trust and investments 
subsequent to initial recognition  goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill is impaired  a non cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings 
such a charge would have no impact on tangible or regulatory capital 
the impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value 
our step one calculation of each reporting unit s fair value is based upon a simple average of two metrics a primary market approach  which measures fair value based upon trading multiples of independent publicly traded financial institutions of comparable size and character to the reporting units  and an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon discounted cash flows dcf and terminal value using the perpetuity growth method 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues step two by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined using the residual approach  where the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit  calculated in step one  is the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
under new accounting guidance effective january   the company has the option at the time of its annual impairment testing to perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before applying the existing two step goodwill impairment test 
if the company concludes that this is the case  the company would proceed with the existing two step test  as described above 
otherwise  the company would be able to bypass the two step test and conclude that goodwill is not impaired from a qualitative perspective 
in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october   we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment and chose to proceed with the quantitative two step test 
as a result of our step one analysis  the company determined that the fair value of both the banking and trust and investments reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 
as such  both of the company reporting units with allocated goodwill passed step one of the goodwill impairment test  and no further analysis was required to support the conclusion that goodwill was not impaired as of october  the banking reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying amount by  while the trust and investments reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 
the company is not aware of any events or circumstances subsequent to its annual goodwill impairment testing date of october  that would indicate impairment of goodwill at december  
table of contents goodwill impairment testing is considered a critical accounting estimate as estimates and assumptions are made about future performance and cash flows  as well as other prevailing market factors 
for our annual impairment testing  we engage an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit 
in connection with obtaining an independent third party valuation  management provides certain information and assumptions that are utilized in the calculations 
assumptions critical to the process include forecasted earnings  which are developed for each segment by considering several key business drivers such as historical performance  forward interest rates using forward interest rate curves to forecast future expected interest rates  anticipated loan and deposit growth  and industry and economic trends  discount rates  and credit quality assessments  among other considerations 
we provide the best information available at the time to be used in these estimates and calculations 
changes in these assumptions due to macroeconomic  industry wide  or company specific developments subsequent to the date of our annual goodwill impairment test could affect the results of our goodwill impairment analysis 
identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are subject to impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during  there were no events or circumstances to indicate that there may be impairment of intangible assets 
the company intangible assets include core deposit premiums  client relationship  and assembled workforce intangibles 
all of these intangible assets have finite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over varying periods not exceeding years 
income taxes the determination of income tax expense or benefit  and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on complex analyses of many factors  including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessments of the likelihood that the reversals of deferred deductible temporary differences will yield tax benefits  and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
in addition  for interim reporting purposes  management generally determines its income tax provision  before consideration of any discrete items  based on its current best estimate of pre tax income  permanent differences and the resulting effective tax rate expected for the full year 
we are subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we periodically undergo examination by various governmental taxing authorities 
such authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense be recognized when their interpretations of tax law differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  new interpretations of existing law or positions by federal or state taxing authorities  will not result in tax liability amounts that differ from our current assessment of such amounts  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
temporary differences may give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods based on weighing both positive and negative evidence and establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets for which recovery is unlikely  based on a standard of more likely than not 
in making this assessment  we must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize these assets through a the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  b future taxable income  c the possible application of future tax planning strategies  and d carryback to taxable income in prior years 
we have not established a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets at december  however  there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we have concluded  as of december   that it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will be realized 
in the preparation of income tax returns  tax positions are taken based on interpretations of federal and state income tax laws for which the outcome of such positions may not be certain 
we periodically review and evaluate the status of uncertain tax positions and may establish tax reserves for tax benefits that may not be realized 
the amount of any such reserves are based on the standards for determining such reserves as set forth in current accounting guidance and our estimates of amounts that may ultimately be due or owed including interest 
these estimates may change from time to time based on our evaluation of developments subsequent to the filing of the income tax return  such as tax authority audits  court decisions or other tax law interpretations 
there can be no assurance that any tax reserves will be sufficient to cover tax liabilities that may ultimately be determined to be owed 
at december   we had  of tax reserves established relating to uncertain tax positions that would favorably affect the company effective tax rate if recognized in future periods

table of contents fair value measurements certain of the company s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date  including securities available for sale  derivatives  and certain loans held for sale 
additionally  other assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including impaired loans and other real estate owned oreo  which are subject to fair value adjustments under certain circumstances 
the company measures fair value in accordance with us gaap  which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes fair value measurements based on the observability of the valuation inputs used in determining fair value 
level valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations use at least one significant unobservable input that is supported by little or no market activity 
judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in level or level when making this judgment  we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
classification of level or level is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instrument fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level judgment is also required when determining the fair value of an asset or liability when either relevant observable inputs do not exist or available observable inputs are in a market that is not active 
when relevant observable inputs are not available  the company must use its own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk adjusted discount rates 
conversely  in some cases observable inputs may require significant adjustments 
for example  in cases where the volume and level of trading activity in an asset or liability is very limited  actual transaction prices vary significantly over time or among market participants  or the prices are not current  the observable inputs may not be relevant and could require adjustment 
the company uses a variety of methods to measure the fair value of financial instruments on a recurring basis and to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from external sources on at least a quarterly basis  including evaluating pricing service inputs and methodologies  using exception reports based on analytical criteria  comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources  and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on company knowledge of market liquidity and other market related conditions 
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
the inability to precisely measure the fair value of certain assets  such as oreo  may lead to changes in the fair value of those assets over time as unobservable inputs change  which can result in volatility in the amount of income or loss recorded for a particular position from quarter to quarter 
additional information regarding fair value measurements is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our asset liability management  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
we may manage interest rate risk by structuring the asset and liability characteristics of our balance sheet and or by executing derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
we initiated the use of interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy in july to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating rate loan portfolio and  depending on market conditions  we may expand this program and enter into additional interest rate swaps 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated statements of income 
the majority of our interest earning assets are floating rate instruments 
at december   approximately of the total loan portfolio is indexed to libor  of the total loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate  and another of the total loan portfolio otherwise adjusts with other reference interest rates 
of the billion in loans maturing after one year with a floating interest rate   or billion  are subject to interest rate floors  of which are in effect at december  and are 
table of contents reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis below 
to manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet  we have the ability to use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings  variable rate debt instruments  fixed rate loans and securities and interest rate swaps 
we use a simulation model to estimate the potential impact of various interest rate changes on our income statement and our interest earning asset and interest bearing liability portfolios 
the starting point of the analysis is the current size and nature of these portfolios at the beginning of the measurement period as well as the then current applicable pricing structures 
during the twelve month measurement period  the model will re price assets and liabilities based on the contractual terms and market rates in effect at the beginning of the measurement period and assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the applicable yield curves and instruments remain at that new interest rate through the end of the twelve month measurement period 
the model only analyzes changes in the portfolios based on assets and liabilities at the beginning of the measurement period and does not assume any changes from growth or business plans over the following twelve months 
the sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
in addition  the simulation model assumes certain one time instantaneous interest rate shifts that are consistent across all yield curves and do not continue to increase over the measurement period 
as such  these assumptions and modeling reflect an estimation of the sensitivity to interest rates or market risk and do not predict the timing and direction of interest rates or the shape and steepness of the yield curves 
therefore  the actual results may differ materially from these simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
modeling the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
these assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated in the context of various internal and external factors including balance sheet changes  product offerings  product mix  external micro and macro economic factors  anticipated client behavior and anticipated company and market pricing behavior 
during the second quarter of  we conducted historical deposit re pricing and deposit lifespan retention analyses and adjusted our forward looking assumptions related to client and market behavior 
based on our analyses and judgments  we modified the core deposit product repricing characteristics and retention periods  as well as average life estimates  used in our interest rate risk modeling which reflects higher interest rate sensitivity of our deposits 
the increase in the overall interest rate sensitivity at december  compared to december   as reflected in the table below  is primarily due to an increase in the interest rate sensitivity of our assets since december  even including the impact of the assumptions modified in  some of which decreased our interest rate sensitivity  overall interest rate sensitivity increased during due to asset and liability compositional changes 
we experienced growth in the rate sensitive asset categories of loans indexed to short term libor as well as short term cash on deposit with the federal reserve 
the growth in assets was funded by growth in demand deposits and money market accounts 
taken together  growth in highly rate sensitive assets was funded by growth in less rate responsive liabilities  producing an increase in overall increase rate sensitivity 
this effect was partially mitigated by the hedging program established in based on the modeling  the company remains in an asset sensitive position and would benefit from a rise in interest rates 
we will continue to periodically review and refine  as appropriate  the assumptions used in our interest rate risk modeling 

table of contents the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of december  based on our current simulation modeling assumptions and as of december   as previously reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollars in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change 
as an example  this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by million  or  over a twelve month period  as compared to a net interest income increase of million  or  if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december
