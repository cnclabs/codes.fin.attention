trends expected to impact the discussion of trends expected to impact our business in is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
differences in actual economic conditions during compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and part i  item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements 
throughout  global economic conditions remained weak 
we cannot predict the duration or extent of the severity of these economic conditions  nor the extent to which these conditions could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
while the money remittance industry has generally been resilient during times of economic softness  the current global economic conditions have continued to adversely impact the demand for money remittances 
while there is uncertainty around the global economy and the remittance industry  the world bank  a key source of industry analysis for developing countries  is projecting seven percent remittance growth in  which is an acceleration from estimates 
our growth has historically exceeded the world bank projections 
in  we signed a new contract extending our relationship with walmart  which continues this relationship through march in january  we signed a five year contract with tesco bank to provide moneygram money transfer services  on an exclusive basis  in up to tesco store locations across the uk and the republic of ireland 
agent expansion and increasing productivity in our existing agent locations through marketing support  customer acquisition and new product innovation will drive growth 
commissions expense and signing bonuses may increase as we continue our agent expansion and retention efforts throughout we believe all of these efforts will not only help to mitigate the effects of the current global economic conditions  but position us for enhanced market share and growth when the economy begins to recover 
historically  we have been the value leader in most markets 
at the end of  our largest competitor announced significant price cuts to several markets  of which some were implemented in november to date  we have limited our pricing actions primarily to certain online changes and matched lower prices at our us walmart agent locations 
we are pleased with how our business performed after the price cuts were announced as many consumers chose moneygram for our customer experience  flexibility and convenient payout network 
we continue to review markets where we may have an opportunity to increase prices based on increased brand awareness  loyalty and competitive positioning 
we are monitoring consumer behavior to ensure that we continue our market share momentum 
for our financial paper products segment  we expect the decline in overall paper based transactions to continue in as a result of the pricing initiatives undertaken in prior years  we have reduced the commission rates paid to our official check financial institution customers and instituted certain per item and other fees for both the official check and money order services 
in addition  the historically low interest rate environment has resulted in low or no commissions being paid to our official check financial institution customers 
as a result  we anticipate that the financial paper products segment will continue to experience a decline in outstanding balances in we continue to see a trend among state  federal and international regulators toward enhanced scrutiny of anti money laundering compliance  as well as consumer fraud prevention and education 
we will take proactive steps that we feel are in the best interest of consumers to prevent consumer fraud 
while we do not know what regions in which we may choose to take future action  in late we placed limits on face value sent from the us to mexico 
additionally  the terms of the dpa will impose additional costs upon the company related to compliance and other required terms  and such additional compliance costs could be substantial 
as we continue 
table of contents to revise our processes and enhance our technology systems to meet regulatory trends and to comply with the terms of the dpa  our operating expenses for compliance may increase 
acquisition and disposal activity acquisition and disposal activity is set forth in note acquisitions and disposals of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have various resources available to us for the purposes of managing liquidity and capital needs  including our investment portfolio  credit facilities and letters of credit 
we refer to our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and available for sale investments collectively as our investment portfolio 
we utilize the assets in excess of payment service obligations measure shown below in various liquidity and capital assessments 
while assets in excess of payment service obligations  as defined  are a capital measure  it also serves as the foundation for various liquidity analyses 
assets in excess of payment service obligations year ended december  amounts in millions cash and cash equivalents substantially restricted receivables  net substantially restricted short term investments substantially restricted available for sale investments substantially restricted payment service obligations assets in excess of payment service obligations liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include cash flows generated by the sale of our payment instruments  our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances  proceeds from our investment portfolio and credit capacity under our credit facilities 
our primary operating liquidity needs relate to the settlement of payment service obligations to our agents and financial institution customers  as well as general operating expenses 
to meet our payment service obligations at all times  we must have sufficient highly liquid assets and be able to move funds globally on a timely basis 
on average  we receive in and pay out a similar amount of funds on a daily basis to collect and settle the principal amount of our payment instruments sold and related fees and commissions with our end consumers and agents 
we use the incoming funds from sales of new payment instruments to settle our payment service obligations for previously sold payment instruments 
this pattern of cash flows allows us to settle our payment service obligations through on going cash generation rather than liquidating investments or utilizing our revolving credit facility 
we have historically generated  and expect to continue generating  sufficient cash flows from daily operations to fund ongoing operational needs 
we also seek to maintain funding capacity beyond our daily operating needs to provide a cushion through the normal fluctuations in our payment service assets and obligations  as well as to provide working capital for the operational and growth requirements of our business 
while the assets in excess of payment service obligations would be available to us for our general operating needs and investment in the company  we consider our assets in excess of payment service obligations as assurance that regulatory and contractual requirements are maintained 
we believe we have sufficient liquid assets and funding capacity to operate and grow our business for the next months 
should our liquidity needs exceed our operating cash flows  we believe that external financing sources  including availability under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated funding requirements 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short term investments substantially restricted to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs at all times  we keep a significant portion of our investment portfolio in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at financial institutions rated a or better by moody s investor service  or moody s  and a or better by standard poors  or s p  and in us government money market funds rated aaa by moody s and aa by s p 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion  representing percent of our total investment portfolio 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist of money market funds that invest in us government and government agency securities  time deposits and certificates of deposit 
available for sale investments our investment portfolio includes million of available for sale investments as of december  us government agency residential mortgage backed securities and us government agency debentures compose million of our available for sale investments  while other asset backed securities compose the remaining million 
clearing and cash management banks we collect and disburse money through a network of clearing and cash management banks 
the relationships with these banks are a critical component of our ability to maintain our global cash management requirements on a timely basis 
we have agreements with ten clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks  money orders and other draft instruments 
we have nine official check clearing banks  of which five banks are currently operating under post termination arrangements of their contracts 
the remaining four active banks provide sufficient capacity for our official check business 
we rely on three banks to clear our retail money orders and believe that these banks provide sufficient capacity for that business 
we also maintain relationships with a variety of domestic and international cash management banks for ach and wire transfer services used in the movement of consumer funds and agent settlements 
there are a limited number of international cash management banks with a network large enough to manage cash settlements for our entire agent base  and some of these large international banks have opted not to bank money service businesses 
as a result  we also utilize regional or country based banking partners in addition to large cash management banks 
special purpose entities for certain financial institution customers  we established individual special purpose entities  or spes  upon the origination of our relationship 
along with operational processes and certain financial covenants  these spes provide the financial institutions with additional assurance of our ability to clear their official checks 
under these relationships  the investment portfolio assets and payment service obligations related to the financial institution customer are all held by the spe 
financial covenants related to spes include the maintenance of specified ratios of greater than percent of cash  cash equivalents and investments held in the spe to outstanding payment instruments issued by the related financial institution 
as the related financial institution customer sells our payment service instruments  the principal amount of the instrument and any fees are paid into the spe 
as payment service instruments issued by the financial institution customer are presented for payment  the cash and cash equivalents within the spe are used to settle the instrument 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents within spes are generally not available for use outside of the spe 
we remain liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually and under the uniform commercial code  as the issuer and drawer of the official checks regardless of the existence of the spes 
accordingly  we consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of these spes in our consolidated balance sheets  with the individual assets and liabilities of the spes classified in a manner similar to our other assets and liabilities 
under limited circumstances  the financial institution customers that are beneficiaries of the spes have the right to either demand liquidation of the assets in the spes or to replace us as the administrator of the spe 
such limited circumstances consist of material  and in most cases continued  failure to uphold our warranties and obligations pursuant to the underlying agreements with the financial institutions 
as of december   the combined spes held one percent of our billion portfolio 
as the spes relate to financial institution customers we terminated in connection with the restructuring of our official check business  we expect the spes to decline as a percentage of our portfolio

the incremental term loan has quarterly principal payments of million  which began september   with the remaining outstanding principal due november at each reset period  we may elect an interest rate for the credit agreement  based on the boa prime rate plus basis points or the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
if the eurodollar rate is elected  there is a minimum rate of percent 
fees on the daily unused availability under the revolving credit facility are basis points 
since inception of the credit agreement and through the date of this filing  the company elected the eurodollar rate as its primary interest basis  with a minimal amount of the term debt at the boa prime rate 
our credit agreement contains various financial and non financial covenants 
a violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and or causing acceleration of amounts due under the credit facilities 
the financial covenants in our credit agreement measure leverage  interest coverage and liquidity 
leverage is measured through a senior secured debt ratio calculated as consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  adjusted for certain items such as net securities gains  stock based compensation expense  certain legal settlements and asset impairments  among other items  also referred to as adjusted ebitda 
this measure is similar  but not identical  to the measure discussed under ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
interest coverage is calculated as adjusted ebitda to net cash interest expense 
liquidity is measured as assets in excess of payment service obligations adjusted for various exclusions 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  we continue to

we continue to monitor our covenants and make necessary adjustments to our plans to ensure compliance 
the indenture governing the second lien notes contains a financial covenant requiring the company to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of at least for certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations 
our liquidity ratio for certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations is as of december  the second lien notes also contain a call provision that permits moneygram to call the notes on or after march  at a price of 
we anticipate issuing new debt to refinance the second lien notes as soon as practicable when the call is effective 
the terms of our credit agreement also place restrictions on certain types of payments we may make  including dividends on our common stock  acquisitions and the funding of foreign subsidiaries  among others 
we do not anticipate that these restrictions will limit our ability to grow the business either domestically or internationally 
in addition  we may only make dividend payments to common stockholders subject to an incremental build up based on our consolidated net income in future periods 
no dividends were paid on our common stock in  and we do not anticipate declaring any dividends on our common stock during equity registration rights agreement the company and the investors entered into a registration rights agreement  or the equity registration rights agreement  on march   with respect to the series b stock and d stock  and the common stock owned by the investors and their affiliates  also referred to collectively as the registrable securities 
under the terms of the equity registration rights agreement  we are required to file with the sec a shelf registration statement relating to the offer and sale of the registrable securities and keep such shelf registration statement continuously effective under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  until the earlier of the date as of which all of the registrable securities have been sold  the date as of which each of the holders of the registrable securities is permitted to sell its registrable securities without registration pursuant to rule under the securities act and fifteen years 
the holders of the registrable securities are also entitled to six demand registrations and unlimited piggyback registrations during the term of the equity registration rights agreement 
on july   the sec declared effective a shelf registration statement on form s that permits the offer and sale of the registrable securities  as required by the terms of the equity registration rights agreement 
the registration statement also permits the company to offer and sell up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or any combination of these  from time to time  subject to market conditions and the company s capital needs 
in december  the company completed the secondary offering pursuant to which the investors sold an aggregate of  shares of company common stock at a price of per share in an underwritten offering 
credit ratings as of december  our credit ratings from moody s and s p were b and bb  respectively 
our credit facilities  regulatory capital requirements and other obligations are not impacted by the level of our credit ratings 
however  higher credit ratings could increase our ability to attract capital  reduce our 
table of contents weighted average cost of capital and obtain more favorable terms with our lenders  agents and clearing and cash management banks 
contractual and regulatory capital regulatory capital requirements we have capital requirements relating to government regulations in the us and other countries where we operate 
such regulations typically require us to maintain certain assets in a defined ratio to our payment service obligations 
through our wholly owned subsidiary and licensed entity  mpsi  we are regulated in the us by various state agencies that generally require us to maintain a pool of liquid assets and investments in an amount generally equal to the regulatory payment service obligation measure  as defined by each state  for our regulated payment instruments  namely teller checks  agent checks  money orders and money transfers 
the regulatory requirements do not require us to specify individual assets held to meet our payment service obligations  nor are we required to deposit specific assets into a trust  escrow or other special account 
rather  we must maintain a pool of liquid assets 
provided we maintain a total pool of liquid assets sufficient to meet the regulatory and contractual requirements  we are able to withdraw  deposit or sell our individual liquid assets at will  without prior notice  penalty or limitations 
in its most restrictive state  the company had an excess pool of liquid assets of million over the state s payment service obligations measure at december   with a substantially higher excess pool of liquid assets for most other states 
the regulatory requirements in the us are similar to our internal measure of assets in excess of payment service obligations set forth in assets in excess of payment service obligations 
the regulatory payment service assets measure varies by state 
the most restrictive states may exclude assets held at banks that do not belong to a national insurance program  varying amounts of accounts receivable balances and or assets held in the spes 
the regulatory payment service obligation measure varies by state  but in all cases is substantially lower than our payment service obligations as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets as we are not regulated by state agencies for payment service obligations resulting from outstanding cashier s checks or for amounts payable to agents and brokers 
all states require mpsi to maintain positive net worth  with one state also requiring mpsi to maintain positive tangible net worth of million 
as of december   mpsi had a net worth in excess of million 
we are also subject to regulatory requirements in various countries outside of the us  which typically result in needing to either prefund agent settlements or hold minimum required levels of cash within the applicable country 
the most material of these requirements is in the united kingdom  where our licensed entity  moneygram international limited  is required to maintain a cash and cash equivalent balance equal to outstanding payment instruments issued in the european community 
this amount fluctuates based on our level of activity within the european community  and is likely to increase over time as our business expands in that region 
assets used to meet these regulatory requirements support our payment service obligations  but are not available to satisfy other liquidity needs 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash deployed outside of the us to meet regulatory requirements 
we were in compliance with all financial regulatory requirements as of december  we believe that our liquidity and capital resources will remain sufficient to ensure ongoing compliance with all financial regulatory requirements 

table of contents other funding sources and requirements contractual obligations the following table includes aggregated information about the company s contractual obligations that impact our liquidity and capital needs 
the table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by type of contractual obligation

our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes million of debt  net of unamortized discounts of million  and million of accrued interest on the debt 
the above table reflects the principal and interest that will be paid through the maturity of the debt using the rates in effect on december   and assuming no prepayments of principal and the continued payment of interest on the second lien notes 
operating leases consist of various leases for buildings and equipment used in our business 
signing bonuses are payments to certain agents and financial institution customers as an incentive to enter into long term contracts 
marketing represents contractual marketing obligations with certain agents and billers 
other obligations are primarily comprised of the remaining million payment for the settlement related to the mdpa forfeiture  due days from the settlement date 
we have other commitments as described further below that are not included in this table as the timing and or amount of payments are difficult to estimate 
we have a funded  noncontributory pension plan that is frozen to both future benefit accruals and new participants 
our funding policy has historically been to contribute the minimum contribution required by applicable regulations 
we made contributions of million to the defined benefit pension plan during we anticipate a minimum contribution of million to the defined benefit pension plan in we also have certain unfunded pension and postretirement plans that require benefit payments over extended periods of time 
during  we paid benefits totaling million related to these unfunded plans 
benefit payments under these unfunded plans are expected to be million in expected contributions and benefit payments under these plans are not included in the above table  as it is difficult to estimate the timing and amount of benefit payments and required contributions beyond the next months 
see note pensions and other benefits of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million as of december  the company s consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years were under examination by the irs 
the irs issued notices of deficiency disallowing among other items approximately million of deductions on securities losses in the  and tax returns 
the company petitioned the us tax court contesting adjustments related to the securities losses in  and while we believe the company s position will be sustained  if the company s petition is denied in its entirety  the company would be required to make cash payments of million based on benefits taken through december  as there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with the million  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
these amounts are excluded from the table above as there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of future cash outflows 

table of contents in limited circumstances  we may grant minimum commission guarantees as an incentive to new or renewing agents for a specified period of time at a contractually specified amount 
under the guarantees  we will pay to the agent the difference between the contractually specified minimum commission and the actual commissions earned by the agent 
as of december   the minimum commission guarantees had a maximum payment of million over a weighted average remaining term of years 
the maximum payment is calculated as the contractually guaranteed minimum commission times the remaining term of the contract and  therefore  assumes that the agent generates no money transfer transactions during the remainder of its contract 
as of december   the liability for minimum commission guarantees was million 
minimum commission guarantees are not reflected in the table above

while we consider our overall investment portfolio to be part of our operations  in accordance with gaap  investments in cash and cash equivalents and trading investments are presented as part of operating activities  while investments in short term and available for sale investment securities are presented as part of investing activities 
to understand the cash flow activity of our core business  the cash flows from operating activities relating to the payment service assets and obligations should be reviewed in conjunction with the net cash flows from investing activities related to our short term investments and available for sale investments 
the company  in conjunction with its november settlement of the mdpa us doj investigation  paid a forfeiture of million in november and million in january these payments were made with the company s cash on hand  and no borrowings or other external sources of liquidity were required 
this million forfeiture did not have an adverse effect on the credit ratings of the company and did not adversely affect compliance with financial covenants pertaining to any of the company s credit agreements 
we received no income tax refunds during and  respectively 
we received an income tax refund of million during we made income tax payments of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
due to our regulatory capital requirements  we deem our payment service assets in their entirety to be substantially restricted 
as a result  we do not separately display in our statement of cash flows an unrestricted measure of cash and cash equivalents and the related change in such measure for the period 
if we were to 
table of contents separately display such an unrestricted measure  it would approximate our assets in excess of payment service obligations measure  and the amount of change for the period would approximate the change in our assets in excess of payment service obligations for the period

table of contents free cash flow we believe that free cash flow adjusted ebitda less cash interest expense  cash tax expense  cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations  including our ability to service debt and fund operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
these calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors  analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry 
free cash flow is a financial measure used by management in reviewing results of operations  as well as assessing cash flow and capital resources 
although we believe that free cash flow enhances investors understanding of our business and performance  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered an exclusive alternative to accompanying gaap financial measures 
while we believe that this metric enhances investors understanding of our business  this metric is not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on a regular basis  management reviews its accounting policies  assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
based on these criteria  management has identified and discussed with the audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  including the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates 
goodwill we have two reporting units  global funds transfer and financial paper products 
our global funds transfer reporting unit is the only reporting unit that carries goodwill 
on an annual basis  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  we test for goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or other methods of valuation 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our long term projections by reporting unit 
in addition  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
assumptions used in our impairment testing are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
our discount rate is based on our debt and equity balances  adjusted for current market conditions and investor expectations of return on our equity 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if not  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  a write down of the reporting unit s goodwill would be necessary 
we did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss for  or the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the global funds transfer reporting unit at december  was million 
no goodwill is assigned to financial paper products reporting unit 
the annual impairment test indicated a fair value for the global funds transfer reporting unit that was substantially in excess of the reporting unit s carrying value 

table of contents if the discount rate for the global funds transfer reporting unit increases by basis points from the rate used in our fair value estimate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the growth rate for the global funds transfer reporting unit decreases by basis points from the rate used in our fair value estimate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
our estimated fair value for the global funds transfer reporting unit would continue to be substantially in excess of the carrying value of the segment assets under either scenario 
fair value of investment securities the company has available for sale investments that are recorded at their estimated fair value 
our available for sale investments are comprised primarily of us government agency debenture securities and residential mortgage backed securities collateralized by us government agency debenture securities 
in addition  we hold other asset backed securities and have historically held three trading investments 
we estimate fair value for our investments as an exit price  or the exchange price that would be received for an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants 
observable price quotes for our exact securities are not available 
for our government agency debentures and residential mortgage backed securities  similar securities trade with sufficient regularity to allow observation of market inputs needed to estimate fair value 
for our other asset backed securities  the overall liquidity and trading within the relevant markets is not strong 
accordingly  observable market inputs are not as readily available and estimating fair value is more subjective 
as of december   we held investments classified as other asset backed securities with a fair value of million 
using the lowest and highest prices received or internally estimated during the valuation process  the range of fair value for these securities was million to million 
at december   million  or less than one percent of our total investment portfolio  was valued using internal pricing information 
no third party price was able to be obtained for these securities 
pension through our qualified pension plan and various supplemental executive retirement plans  collectively referred to as our pension plans  we provide defined benefit pension plan coverage to certain of our employees and employees of viad corporation  our former parent 
our pension obligations under these plans are measured as of december  the measurement date 
pension benefit obligations and the related expense are based upon actuarial projections using assumptions regarding mortality  discount rates  long term return on assets and other factors 
our pension plan assets are primarily invested in interest bearing cash accounts and commingled trust funds issued or sponsored by the plan trustee 
our investments are periodically realigned in accordance with the investment guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
certain of the assumptions  particularly the discount rate and expected return on plan assets  require significant judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on the then current interest rate yield curves for long term corporate debt securities with maturities rated aa comparable to our obligations 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical market experience  our pension asset allocations and our expectations for long term rates of return 
we also consider peer data and historical returns to assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of our assumption 
our pension plan asset allocations are reviewed annually and are based upon plan obligations  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments 
the discount rates for the  and net periodic benefit cost pension plans were percent  percent and percent  respectively  while the discount rates for the serps were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate for the projected benefit obligation for the pension plan for and was percent and percent  respectively  while the discount rate for the serps was percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents the long term expected rate of return for the net periodic benefit cost of the pension plan was seven percent in and eight percent in and  respectively 
the actual rate of return on average plan assets in and was percent and percent  respectively 
lower discount rates increase the plan obligation and subsequent year pension expense  while higher discount rates decrease the plan obligation and subsequent year pension expense 
decreasing the discount rate by basis points would have increased pension expense by million 
if the discount rate increased by basis points pension expense would have decreased by million 
changing the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
income taxes tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
in determining taxable income  income or loss before taxes is adjusted for differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles 
we file tax returns in multiple states within the us and various countries 
our tax filings for all periods are subject to audit by tax authorities  the us federal income tax filings for fiscal years through are currently subject to audit 
the benefits of tax positions are recorded in the income statement if we determine it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including any related appeals or litigation 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
the determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
these assumptions and probabilities are periodically reviewed and revised based upon new information 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
actual tax amounts may be materially different from amounts accrued based upon the results of audits due to different interpretations by the tax authorities than those of the company 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  an unfavorable tax settlement generally requires the use of cash and an increase in the amount of income tax expense that we recognize 
a favorable tax settlement generally requires a decrease in the amount of income taxes that we recognize 
income taxes valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  and operating loss and tax credit carry backs and carry forwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets must be reduced through a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in the period in which a valuation allowance is recorded  we would record tax expense  whereas a tax benefit would be recorded in the period a valuation allowance is reversed 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our assessment of whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted requires judgment and is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis 
we consider  among other matters the nature  frequency and severity of any cumulative financial reporting losses  the ability to carry back losses to prior years  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and projections of future taxable income 

table of contents we also consider our best estimate of the outcome of any on going examinations based on the technical merits of the position  historical procedures and case law  among other items 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against gross net deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to our tax loss carryovers and basis difference in revalued investments 
while we believe that the basis for estimating our valuation allowance is strong  changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events  or other factors  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan  which includes stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
certain awards are subject to market and performance conditions at threshold  target and maximum levels 
for purposes of determining the fair value of stock option awards  the company uses the black scholes single option pricing model for the time based tranches and awards and a combination of monte carlo simulation and the black scholes single option pricing model for the performance based tranches 
compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized using a straight line method over the vesting or service period 
assumptions for stock based compensation include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  employee turnover and employee exercise activity 
performance based share awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving market and performance goals 
assumptions used in our assessment are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans and assume achievement of performance conditions at target

the board receives periodic reports regarding each of these areas and approves significant changes to policy and strategy 
an asset liability committee  composed of senior management  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
a credit committee  composed of senior management  routinely reviews credit exposure to our agents 
following is a discussion of the risks we have deemed most critical to our business and the strategies we use to manage and mitigate such risks 
while containing forward looking statements related to risks and uncertainties  this discussion and related analyses are not predictions of future events 
moneygram s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
credit risk credit risk  or the potential risk that we may not collect amounts owed to us  affects our business primarily through receivables  investments and derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the concentration of our cash  cash equivalents and investments at large financial institutions exposes us to credit risk 
investment portfolio credit risk from our investment portfolio relates to the risk that we may be unable to collect the interest or principal owed to us under the legal terms of the various securities 
our primary exposure to credit risk arises through the concentration of a large amount of our investment portfolio at a few large financial institutions  also referred to as financial institution risk  as well as a concentration in securities issued by  or collateralized by  us government agencies 
at december   the company s investment portfolio of billion was primarily comprised of cash  us government money market funds  bank deposits and bank time deposits 
based on investment policy restrictions in the indenture governing the company s second lien notes  investments are limited to us government securities and securities of agencies of the us government  certificates of deposit and time deposits with banks with minimum debt ratings of a moody s and a s p  commercial paper with minimum ratings of a moody s and p s p and us dollar denominated sec registered senior notes of corporations with minimum ratings of a and a 
no maturity in the portfolio can exceed months from the date of purchase 
the financial institutions holding significant portions of our investment portfolio act as custodians for our asset accounts  serve as counterparties to our foreign currency transactions and conduct cash transfers on our behalf for the purpose of clearing our payment instruments and related agent receivables and agent payables 
through certain check clearing agreements and other contracts  we are required to utilize several of these financial institutions 
as a result of the credit market crisis  several financial institutions have faced capital and liquidity issues that led them to restrict credit exposure 
this has led certain financial institutions to require that we maintain pre defined levels of cash  cash equivalents and investments at these financial institutions overnight  with no restrictions to our usage of the assets during the day 
while the credit market crisis and recession affected all financial institutions  those institutions holding our assets are well capitalized  and there have been no significant concerns as to their ability to honor all obligations related to our holdings 
the concentration in us government agencies includes agencies placed under conservatorship by the us government in and extended unlimited lines of credit from the us treasury 
the implicit guarantee of the us government and its actions to date support our belief that the us government will honor the obligations of its agencies if the agencies are unable to do so themselves 
the following table shows categories of our investment portfolio held within and outside of the us  with each section progressing from the company s perceived lowest to highest credit risk 
all but million of the investment portfolio is invested in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and investments issued or collateralized by us government agencies

these receivables originate from independent agents who collect funds from customers who are transferring money or buying money orders  and agents who receive proceeds from us in anticipation of payment to the recipients of money transfers 
the company has a credit risk management function that conducts the underwriting of credit on new agents as well as conducting credit surveillance on all agents to monitor their financial health and the history of settlement activity with us 
the company s credit risk management function also maintains daily contact with agents  and performs a collection function 
the annual credit losses from our agents are percent 
as of december   we had a credit exposure to our official check financial institution customers of approximately million in the aggregate spread across approximately  financial institutions  of which one owed us in excess of million 
we also have credit exposure to receivables from our financial institution customers for business conducted by the financial paper products segment 
financial institutions will collect proceeds for official checks and money orders and remit those proceeds to us 
credit risk among financial institutions has increased in the current macroeconomic environment 
we actively monitor the credit risk associated with financial institutions such as banks and credit unions  and have not incurred any losses associated with the failure or merger of any bank or non bank financial institution customer 
with respect to our credit union customers  our credit exposure is partially mitigated by national credit union administration insurance 
however  as our credit union customers were not insured by a temporary liquidity guarantee program equivalent program  we have required certain credit union customers to provide us with 
table of contents larger balances on deposit and or to issue cashier s checks only 
while the value of these assets are not at risk in a disruption or collapse of a counterparty financial institution  the delay in accessing our assets could adversely affect our liquidity and potentially our earnings depending upon the severity of the delay and corrective actions we may need to take 
corrective actions could include draws upon our credit agreement to provide short term liquidity until our assets are released  reimbursements of costs or payment of penalties to our agents and higher banking fees to transition banking relationships in a short timeframe 
while the extent of credit risk may vary by product  the process for mitigating risk is similar 
we assess the creditworthiness of each potential agent before accepting them into our distribution network 
this underwriting process includes not only a determination of whether to accept a new agent  but also the remittance schedule and volume of transactions that the agent will be allowed to perform in a given timeframe 
we actively monitor the credit risk of our existing agents by conducting periodic financial reviews and cash flow analyses of our agents that average high volumes of transactions and monitoring remittance patterns versus reported sales on a daily basis 
the timely remittance of funds by our agents and financial institution customers is an important component of our liquidity 
if the timing of the remittance of funds were to deteriorate  it would alter our pattern of cash flows and could require us to liquidate investments or utilize our revolving credit facility to settle payment service obligations 
to manage this risk  we closely monitor the remittance patterns of our agents and financial institution customers and act quickly if we detect deterioration or alteration in remittance timing or patterns 
if deemed appropriate  we have the ability to deactivate an agent s equipment at any time  thereby preventing the initiation or issuance of further money transfers and money orders 
agents typically have from one to three days to remit the funds  with longer remittance schedules granted to international agents and certain domestic agents 
as of december   we had credit exposure to our agents of million in the aggregate spread across over approximately  agents  of which one agent owed us in excess of million 
credit risk management is complimented through functionality within our point of sale system  which can enforce credit limits on a real time basis and monitor for suspicious and unauthorized transactions 
the system also permits us to remotely disable an agent s terminals and cause a cessation of transactions 
derivative financial instruments credit risk related to our derivative financial instruments relates to the risk that we are unable to collect amounts owed to us by the counterparties to our derivative agreements 
our derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the counterparties to any of our derivative financial instruments were to default on payments  it could result in a delay or interruption of payments to our agents 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments by entering into agreements with only major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the risk that our operating results are negatively impacted  and our investment portfolio declines in value  due to changes in interest rates 
given the credit risk profile of the investment portfolio and the low level of interest rates  we believe there is a low risk that the value of these securities would decline such that we would have a material adverse change in our operating results 
as of december   the company held million  or percent  of the investment portfolio in fixed rate investments 
at december   the company s other asset backed securities are priced on average at four percent of face value for a total fair value of million 
included in other asset backed securities are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by high grade debt  mezzanine equity tranches of collateralized debt obligations and home equity loans  along with private equity investments 
while the company does believe its other asset backed securities are at a risk of further decline  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover all losses on these securities 
accordingly  any resulting adverse movement in our stockholders deficit or assets in excess of payment service obligations from further declines in investments would not result in regulatory or contractual compliance exceptions 

table of contents our operating results are primarily impacted by interest rate risk through our net investment margin  which is investment revenue less commissions expense 
as the money transfer business is not materially affected by investment revenue and pays commissions that are not tied to an interest rate index  interest rate risk has the most impact on our money order and official check businesses 
we are invested primarily in interest bearing cash accounts  deposit accounts  time deposits and certificates of deposit  and us government money market funds 
these types of investments have minimal risk of declines in fair value from changes in interest rates 
our commissions paid to financial institution customers are variable rate  based primarily on the federal funds effective rate and are reset daily 
accordingly  both our investment revenue and our investment commissions expense will decrease when rates decline and increase when rates rise 
in the current environment  the federal funds effective rate is so low that most of our financial institution customers are in a negative commission position  and therefore we do not owe any commissions to these customers 
our credit agreement is variable rate resulting in decreases to interest expense in a declining rate environment and increases to interest expense when rates rise 
the company may elect an interest rate for the senior credit facility at each reset period based on the boa prime bank rate or the eurodollar rate 
the credit agreement contains a libor floor of  thus the rate would have to increase by more than basis points to have any impact on interest expense 
the tables below incorporate substantially all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect changes in all interest rates pertaining to the balance sheet 
this analysis assumes that interest rates change suddenly  as in an interest rate shock  and remain at the changed level for the next twelve months 
components of our pre tax loss that are interest rate sensitive include investment revenue  investment commissions expense  and interest expense 
in the current interest rate environment where rates are approaching zero  our risk associated with declining rates is not material 
a rapidly rising interest rate environment would be beneficial to the company because variable rate assets exceed our variable rate liabilities  and certain of our variable rate liabilities will not react to increases in interest rates until those rates exceed the floor set for the index rate on the corresponding debt

table of contents foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business as we offer our products and services through a network of agents and financial institutions with locations in countries 
by policy  we do not speculate in foreign currencies  all currency trades relate to underlying transactional exposures 
our primary source of foreign exchange risk is transactional risk 
this risk is predominantly incurred in the money transfer business in which funds are frequently transferred cross border and we settle with agents in multiple currencies 
although this risk is somewhat limited due to the fact that these transactions are short term in nature  we currently manage some of this risk with forward contracts to protect against potential short term market volatility 
the primary currency pairs  based on volume  that are traded against the dollar in the spot and forward markets include the european euro  mexican peso  british pound and indian rupee 
the duration of forward contracts is typically less than one month 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on transactional currency and any associated revaluation of balance sheet exposures are recorded in transaction and operations support in the consolidated statement of loss income 
the fair market value of any open forward contracts at period end are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates and the related forward contracts for the year ended december  was a loss of million 
additional foreign currency risk is generated from fluctuations in the us dollar value of future foreign currency denominated earnings 
in  fluctuations in the euro exchange rate net of transactional hedging activities resulted in a net increase to our operating loss of million over we do not currently hedge this type of risk 
had the euro appreciated or depreciated relative to the us dollar by percent from actual exchange rates for  pre tax operating income would have increased decreased million for the year 
there are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous  that the unhedged exposure is static  and that we would not hedge any additional exposure 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
translation risk is generated from the accounting translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries from their local currency into usd for consolidation and does not have a significant impact on company results 
these translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
operational risk operational risk represents the potential for loss resulting from our operations 
this may include  but is not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or external parties  business continuation and disaster recovery  errors related to transaction processing and technology  unauthorized transactions and breaches of information security and compliance requirements 
this risk may also include the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
management has direct responsibility for identifying  controlling and monitoring operational risks within their business 
business managers maintain a system of controls to provide transaction authorization and execution  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and to ensure the quality of financial and other data 
our business resiliency group works with each business function to develop plans to support business resumption activities including technology  networks and data centers 
our internal audit function tests the system of internal controls through risk based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the audit committee of the board of directors
