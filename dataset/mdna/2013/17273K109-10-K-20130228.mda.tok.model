item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act  and foreign equivalents of such laws 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million and expensed million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
for the year ending december   we expect to capitalize million and expense million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
item a 
risk factors 
certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in addition  decreased market demand typically results in excess manufacturing capacity among our competitors which  in turn  results in pricing pressure 
as a consequence  a significant downturn in our markets can result in lower profit margins 
in particular  our energy businesses are cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns or anticipated downturns in demand for oil and gas products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military  maritime and hvac markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face significant competition and  if we are not able to respond to competition  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  customer service  on time delivery  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are 
table of contents superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
since we have continuously enhanced and improved lean manufacturing techniques as part of the circor business system 
we believe that this process produces meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  continuous improvement of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to continuously improve our processes  our results of operations may suffer 
implementation of our acquisition  divestiture or repositioning strategies may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary energy  aerospace and flow technology products and access to additional geographic markets 
we expect to spend significant time and effort expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire ultimately will achieve the revenues  profitability or cash flows  or generate the synergies upon which we justify our investment in them  as a result  any such under performing acquisitions could result in impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse effects on our reported operating results  use of cash  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
we also continually review our current business and products to attempt to maximize our performance 
we may in the future deem it appropriate to pursue the divestiture of product lines or businesses as conditions dictate 
any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested assets or businesses  as well as significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to any purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business  and collect the proceeds from any divestitures 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
we may not achieve expected cost savings from repositioning activities and actual charges  costs and adjustments due to repositioning activities may vary materially from our estimates 
our ability to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors  including the following our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative overhead and overlapping sales personnel  rationalize manufacturing capacity  synchronize information technology systems  consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities  significant cash and non cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings  which could offset any such savings  and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any acquisition  divestiture or repositioning activities  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be negatively impacted 

table of contents if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to sell our products in international markets not significantly served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in our efforts to further penetrate these markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding our presence in these international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we cannot pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers  which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers cannot provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards  we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate those customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
in recent years  we have enhanced our dependence on lower cost foreign sources of raw materials  components  and  in some cases  completed products 
managing a geographically diverse supply base inherently poses significant logistical challenges 
while we believe that we also have improved our ability to effectively manage a global supply base  a risk nevertheless exists that we could experience diminished supplier performance resulting in longer than expected lead times and or product quality issues 
the occurrence of such factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver products to customers within our committed time frames and could result in reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada  brazil and asia 
we use forward contracts to help manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively utilize these forward exchange contracts in the future to eliminate significant risk related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 

table of contents we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on our ability to hire new talent and the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
for example  liability insurance typically does not afford coverage for a design or manufacturing defect unless such defect results in injury to person or property 
we generally attempt to contractually limit liability to our customers to risks that are insurable but are not always successful in doing so 
similarly  we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock continues to be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be  and  in the past  has been volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
while we attempt in our public disclosures to provide forward looking information in order to enable investors to anticipate our future performance  such information by its nature represents our good faith forecasting efforts 
in recent years  the unprecedented nature of credit and financial crises and economic recessions  together with the uncertain depth and duration of these crises  has rendered such forecasting more difficult 
as a result  our actual results could differ materially from our forecasts which could cause further volatility in the value of our common stock 
for example  in recent years the stock market as a whole experienced dramatic price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in its report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 

table of contents the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of industry and security  the department of homeland security  the department of state and the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to  and increase the cost of obtaining products from  foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our revolving credit facility agreement  dated may   governs our indebtedness 
this agreement includes provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  as well as the delaware general corporation law  contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 

table of contents we  along with our customers and vendors  face the uncertainty in the public and private credit markets and in general economic conditions in the united states and around the world 
in recent years there has been at times disruption and general slowdown of the public and private capital and credit markets in the united states and around the world 
such conditions can adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and overall financial growth 
our business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical  economic and business conditions and conditions in the financial services market  which each could materially impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  capital resources and liquidity 
additionally  many lenders and institutional investors  at times  have reduced funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets for new financing in the short term  a constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long term operational and capital needs or could limit our ability in the future to consummate strategic acquisitions 
any uncertainty in the credit markets could also negatively impact the ability of our customers and vendors to finance their operations which  in turn  could result in a decline in our sales and in our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and components  thus potentially having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a resurgence of terrorist activity and or political instability around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses 
in the past  terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in and although economic conditions have improved considerably  additional terrorist acts  acts of war or political instability wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  political instability  and other acts of war or hostility  including the recent and current conflicts in iraq  afghanistan and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe  the people s republic of china  morocco  brazil and india  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
in some cases  we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
new regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 
on august   the sec adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals  known as conflict minerals  that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured 
the new rule  which is effective for and requires a disclosure report to be filed by may   will require companies to perform due diligence  disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country 
the new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products  including tantalum  tin  gold and tungsten 
the 
table of contents number of suppliers who provide conflict free minerals may be limited 
in addition  there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements  such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products  as well as costs of possible changes to products  processes  or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities 
as our supply chain is complex  we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement  which may harm our reputation 
in addition  we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so

item legal proceedings 
asbestos and bankruptcy litigation background on july  the filing date  our subsidiary leslie controls  inc leslie filed a voluntary petition the bankruptcy filing under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware and  simultaneously  filed a pre negotiated plan of reorganization as amended  the reorganization plan or plan in an effort to permanently resolve leslie s exposure to asbestos related product liability actions 
on february   the us federal district court for the district of delaware the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court s earlier order confirming leslie s reorganization plan  thus clearing the way for leslie to emerge from bankruptcy 
on april   pursuant to the terms of the reorganization plan  leslie and circor contributed million in cash and a million promissory note the note to fund the leslie controls asbestos trust the trust  and leslie emerged from chapter bankruptcy protection 
under the terms of the plan  all current and future asbestos related claims against leslie  as well as all current and future derivative claims against circor  are now permanently channeled to the trust

company overview circor international  inc designs  manufactures and markets valves and other highly engineered products and sub systems used in the energy  aerospace and industrial markets 
within our major product groups  we develop  manufacture  sell and service a portfolio of fluid control products  subsystems and technologies that enable us to fulfill our customers unique fluid control application needs 
we have organized our reporting structure into three segments energy  aerospace  and flow technologies 
our energy segment primarily serves large international energy projects  short cycle north american energy  and the pipeline transmission equipment and services end markets 
our aerospace segment primarily serves the commercial and military aerospace end markets 
our flow technologies segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including power generation  industrial and process markets  chemical and refining  and industrial and commercial hvac steam 
the flow technologies segment also provides products specifically designed for us and international navy applications 
regarding our results  we had consolidated revenues of million  a organic increase with organic growth in energy up and aerospace up 
even flow technologies  which declined organically  had growth in almost all areas except led equipment where the market was down significantly 
operating income decreased to million inclusive of special repositioning charges of million  which are associated with productivity benefits we expect to realize in excluding these special and repositioning charges  operating income would have increased over cash flow provided by operating activities for was million 
as we look to  the global markets continue to be uncertain  we expect the economies in north america and europe to grow slowly  if at all  and the emerging markets to grow slower than recent years 
within this challenging environment we are focused on margin expansion through our repositioning activities and our circor business system 
we are also focused on organic global growth with sales and marketing initiatives  new product development and acquisition opportunities 
we believe our cash flow from operations and financing capacity is adequate to support these activities 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in three segments energy  aerospace and flow technologies 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
there have been no significant changes from the methodology applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant post delivery obligations remain  the price to the buyers is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we have limited long term arrangements  representing less than of our revenue  requiring delivery of products or services over extended periods of time and revenue and profits on certain of these arrangements are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for inventory we typically analyze our inventory aging and projected future usage on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our inventory allowances 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured on an item by item basis determined based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value 
the provision for inventory allowance is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand are among the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
included in the inventory obsolescence charge for the twelve months ended december  is million and million of repositioning related inventory obsolescence charges for the energy and aerospace segments  respectively 
we believe our inventory allowances remain adequate with the net realizable value of our inventory being higher than our current inventory cost 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  significant price reductions  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence for any reason  including a change in technology or customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence 
penalty accruals some of our customer agreements  primarily in our project related businesses  contain late shipment penalty clauses whereby we are contractually obligated to pay consideration to our customers if we do not meet specified shipment dates 
the accrual for estimated penalties is shown as a reduction of revenue and is based on several factors including historical customer settlement experience and management s assessment of specific shipment delay information 
accruals related to these potential late shipment penalties as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
as we conclude performance under these agreements  the actual amount of consideration paid to our customers may vary from the amounts we currently have accrued 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
a significant portion of our revenue and receivables are from customers who are either in or service the energy  aerospace and industrial markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses 
during   and  the company did not experience any significant losses related to the collection of our accounts receivable 
for the years ended december   and  we had no customers from which we derived revenues that exceeded of our consolidated revenues 
acquisition accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence phase and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
we account for business combinations under the purchase method  and accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair value on the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over their estimated fair value recorded as goodwill 
we determine acquisition related asset and liability fair values through established valuation techniques 
table of contents for industrial manufacturing companies and utilize third party valuation firms to assist in the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies  commitments and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item hereof 
impairment analysis we utilize our three operating segments as our goodwill reporting units as we have discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management and the businesses within each segment have similar economic characteristics 
for the year ended december   the company s three reporting units were energy  aerospace and flow technologies with respective goodwill balances of million  million and million 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at cost  intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we perform an impairment assessment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of the end of our october month end or more frequently if circumstances warrant for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we used our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit  and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital for our step one analysis 
in when we performed our step one analysis  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the respective carrying amount  and no goodwill impairments were recorded 
the fair values utilized for our goodwill assessment exceeded the carrying amounts by approximately  and for our energy  aerospace and flow technologies reporting units  respectively 
if our estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million compared with million as of december  with the only change being due to foreign currency fluctuations 
net intangible assets as of december  were million compared to million as of december  the total net amount of non amortizing assets was million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
see notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill and annual impairment analysis 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and experimental tax credits  domestic manufacturing deduction  state taxes and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the tax rate for included the tax impact of the million of leslie bankruptcy related costs 
excluding this charge and related tax benefit  the effective tax rate would have been 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 
on january   the president of the united states signed legislation that retroactively extended the research and development r d tax credit for two years  from january  through december  the company expects its income tax expense for the first quarter of will reflect the entire benefit of the r d tax credit attributable to and the first quarter of the company will continue to record the benefit of the r d tax credit in subsequent quarters in our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation 
table of contents of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  net deferred income tax assets remained consistent with we maintained a total valuation allowance of million and million at december  and december   respectively  for deferred income tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
such deferred income tax assets had consisted of certain foreign tax credits  foreign and state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
for  the primary reason for the change in the valuation allowance composition related to losses in one of our international subsidiaries that is not likely to produce future tax benefits 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
consequently  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has had a history of domestic and foreign taxable income  is able to avail itself of federal tax carryback provisions  has future taxable temporary differences and projects future domestic and foreign taxable income 
we believe that after considering all of the available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
except for the company s dutch subsidiary  undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are generally considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal and state income taxes has been recorded thereon 
no additional provision is required for the undistributed earnings of the dutch subsidiary 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision 
as of december  and december   accrued interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 
as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million excluding interest of million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
pension benefits we maintain two pension benefit plans  a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan and a nonqualified  noncontributory defined benefit supplemental plan that provides benefits to certain highly compensated officers and employees 
to date  the supplemental plan remains an unfunded plan 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation 
as of july   in connection with a revision to our retirement plan  we froze the pension benefits of our qualified noncontributory plan participants 
under the revised plan  such participants generally do not accrue any additional benefits under the defined benefit plan after july  and instead receive enhanced benefits associated with our defined contribution k plan in which substantially all of our us employees are eligible to participate 
as required in the recognition and disclosure provisions of asc topic  the company recognizes the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in its balance sheet  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the change in the funded status of the plan is recognized in the year in which the change occurs through other comprehensive income 
these provisions also require plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the company s balance sheet date 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 

table of contents assets of our qualified pension plan are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no shares of our common stock in the plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for and for for the qualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expense was for and for for the nonqualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was and for was 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor defined as the threshold above which gains or losses need to be amortized are being recognized over approximately a twenty eight year period for the qualified plan  and a twenty two year period for the nonqualified plan  which represents the weighted average expected remaining life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
the fair value of our defined benefit plans assets at december  was less than the estimated projected benefit obligations 
the fair value of plan assets increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the company s net pension liability increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and million of cash payments for our non qualified supplemental plan 
in  we expect to make voluntary cash contributions of approximately million to our qualified plan and million in payments for our non qualified plan  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations and other future funding requirements may impact cash contribution amounts 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  beginning in the third quarter of  we initiated certain repositioning actions within all three of our operating segments these actions include consolidating facilities  shifting expenses to lower cost regions and exiting certain small non strategic product lines 
these repositioning actions resulted in certain repositioning related charges being recorded during the twelve months ended december  these repositioning related charges include inventory valuation reserves  intangible impairments  and special charges  which includes employee related costs and asset write offs 
additional information with regard to these repositioning related charges is provided below 
we expect to incur additional repositioning related special charges between million and million during the first half of between million and million for the energy segment  between million and million for the aerospace segment and between million and million for the flow technologies segment to complete these repositioning actions 
these repositioning activities are expected to be funded with cash generated from operations 
in the energy segment the repositioning impacts our brazil operations  shifting non core manufacturing to low cost suppliers and exiting some non strategic products or product lines 
in the aerospace segment the repositioning action includes consolidating our three california facilities into two and exiting some small non strategic products or product lines 
the flow technologies repositioning action includes the consolidation of our ahmedabad  india manufacturing operation into a newly constructed facility in coimbatore  india

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in machinery  equipment and the improvement of facilities  funding working capital requirements to support business growth initiatives  acquisitions  dividend payments  pension funding obligations and debt service costs 
we have historically generated cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the twelve month periods indicated in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   we generated million in operating activities compared to using million during the twelve months ended december  the increase in cash generated in operating activities was primarily due to a payment of million to fund the leslie controls asbestos trust as described in more detail in part i  item  legal proceedings hereof  and less cash used for operating assets and liabilities 
during the twelve months ended december  we used approximately million in cash from operating assets and liabilities compared to using million during the same period in during the twelve months ended december  inventories were a source of cash of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  when we used million to acquire inventory with the energy segment being the biggest contributor 
during the twelve months ended december  prepaid expenses and other assets were a use of cash of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  when we used million 
during the twelve months ended december  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities were uses of cash of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  which was a source of million of cash 
the million used by investing activities included million used for the net purchase of capital equipment 
financing activities used million in  which included a net million of repayment on borrowings and million in dividend payments to shareholders 
as of december   total debt was million compared to million at december  due to repayments on existing borrowings including our credit facility 
total debt as a percentage of total shareholders equity was as of december  compared to as of december  on may   we entered into a five year unsecured credit agreement credit agreement that provides for a million revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement includes a million accordion feature for a maximum facility size of million 
the credit agreement also allows for additional indebtedness not to exceed million 
we anticipate borrowing under the credit agreement to fund potential acquisitions  to support our organic growth initiatives and working capital needs  and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit facility and million was allocated to support outstanding letters of credit 
certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and also limit our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to shareholders  acquire and dispose of businesses  invest in capital equipment  transfer assets among domestic and international entities  participate in certain higher yielding long term investment vehicles  and issue additional shares of our stock 
the two primary financial covenants are leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants related to our existing debt obligations at december  and we believe it is reasonably likely that we will continue to meet such covenants in the near future 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  compared to at december  the increase in the current ratio was primarily due to reductions in accounts payable and income taxes payable compared to december  as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  substantially all of which was held in foreign bank accounts 
this compares to million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  of which 
table of contents million was held in foreign bank accounts 
the cash and cash equivalents located at our foreign subsidiaries may not be repatriated to the united states or other jurisdictions without significant tax implications 
we believe that our us based subsidiaries  in the aggregate  will generate positive operating cash flows and in addition we may utilize our credit facility for us based subsidiary cash needs 
as a result  we believe that we will not need to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries with earnings that are indefinitely reinvested 
on november   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s under which we may issue up to million of securities including debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants to purchase any such securities and units comprised of any such securities the securities 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december  we may offer these securities from time to time in amounts  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
we believe that with this registration statement  we will have greater flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities  acquisitions and other business opportunities when and if such opportunities arise 
depending on market conditions  we may issue securities under this or future registration statements or in private offerings exempt from registration requirements 
in  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities sufficient to support our capital expenditures and pay dividends of approximately million based on our current dividend practice of paying per share annually 
based on our expected cash flows from operations and contractually available borrowings under our credit facility  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund working capital needs and future growth 
we continue to search for strategic acquisitions  a larger acquisition may require additional borrowings and or the issuance of our common stock

the estimates for plan funding for future periods may change as a result of the uncertainties concerning the return on plan 
table of contents assets  the number of plan participants  and other changes in actuarial assumptions 
we anticipate fulfilling these commitments through our generation of cash flow from operations

new accounting standards refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease  expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand 
these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk on certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to the extent the underlying transactions hedged are completed  these forward contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
these forward contracts do not qualify as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment 
any unrealized gains and losses on our contracts are recognized as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had twelve forward contracts with amounts as follows in thousands currency number contract amount us dollar gbp us dollars euro gbp euros canadian dollar euro canadian dollars us dollar euro us dollars brazilian real euro brazilian reals this compares to six forward contracts as of december  the fair value asset of the derivative forward contracts as of december  was approximately million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
this compares to a fair value asset of million that was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet as of december  the unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses for the year ended december   and are less than million for each year and are included in other income or expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our foreign currency forward contracts fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  found under asc topic the credit valuation adjustments  such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties are level inputs 
however  we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our foreign currency forward contracts and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation 
as a result  we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy
