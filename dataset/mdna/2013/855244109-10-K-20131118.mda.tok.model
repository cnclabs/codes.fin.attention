overview starbucks segment results for fiscal demonstrate the fundamental health of our global business model and our continued ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner 
our strong revenue growth of and continued segment margin expansion drove increased operating cash flows  which allowed us to both fund our growth initiatives and increase cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
the americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal  with revenues growing and comparable store sales growth of 
strength in beverage innovation and promotions  operational improvements  and expanded food offerings all contributed to the increase in comparable store sales 
operating margin expanded basis points to  driven by sales leverage  store efficiencies  and lower commodity costs 
looking forward  we expect to continue to drive sales growth and profitability through new stores and enhanced product offerings  including the continued roll out of la boulange bakery items into all of our company operated stores by the end of fiscal in the emea segment  we are continuing to make steady progress toward long term profitability in the region 
revenues grew compared to the prior year  with licensed store revenue growth nearly offset by a decline in company operated store revenues 
this reflects the shift in our ownership structure  as we have closed underperforming company operated stores and are focused on growing our licensed store base in profitable locations 
comparable store sales were flat year over year  but were modestly positive in the second half of fiscal emea operating margin improved to in fiscal due to our ongoing cost management efforts and our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year 
we expect the investments we are making in this segment will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid teens operating margin over time 
our cap segment results reflect a combination of rapid new store growth and solid performance from our existing store base  including our joint venture operations in china and japan 
new store growth  along with a increase in comparable store sales  drove a increase in total net revenues for fiscal operating income grew to million and operating margin was unchanged at  primarily due to our rapid growth shifting away from our historically licensed model 
we expect this segment will become a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability in the future  as we look forward to continued store openings and establishing china as our largest market outside of the us 

table of contents channel development segment revenues grew in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of premium single serve products 
lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal as we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores  including growing our presence in the premium single serve category  we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to our future growth 
our consolidated operating results included a litigation charge as a result of the conclusion of our arbitration with kraft which resulted in a pretax charge to operating expenses of billion 
the conclusion of this litigation is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund this expected payment  both in the form of cash on hand and the expected issuance of additional debt in fiscal fiscal the view ahead for fiscal year  we expect revenue growth driven by mid single digit global comparable store sales growth   new store openings  and continued growth in the channel development business 
we expect fiscal year consolidated operating margin improvement  when compared to our fiscal operating results excluding the litigation charge associated with the kraft arbitration  of to basis points and strong eps growth  driven primarily by leverage on revenue growth 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be approximately capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be approximately billion  primarily for store renovations and new stores  as well for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives 
operating segment overview starbucks has four reportable operating segments americas  inclusive of the us  canada  and latin america markets  europe  middle east  and africa  emea  china asia pacific cap and channel development 
all other segments includes teavana  seattle best coffee and evolution fresh  as well as our digital ventures business 
the americas  emea and cap segments include company operated stores and licensed stores 
licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee 
the emea and cap segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated stores compared to the americas segment  however  the americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other two segments 
average sales per store are also higher in the americas due to various factors including length of time in market 
in certain international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher than in the us market due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country specific regulatory requirements 
because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development  operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the us market 
international markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income  than the us market 
we continue to add new stores in both existing  more mature markets such as the us  and in newer  higher growth markets such as china 
our disciplined approach to expanding our global store base also includes optimizing the mix of company operated and licensed stores in each market 
our channel development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees  premium tazo teas  starbucks and tazo branded single serve products  a variety of ready to drink beverages  such as starbucks refreshers beverages  and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores  warehouse clubs  specialty retailers  convenience stores  and us foodservice accounts 
ready to drink beverages are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership  a joint venture with the pepsi cola company 
the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included  on a net basis  in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k for information regarding acquisitions

our short term investments consisted predominantly of us treasury securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
also included in our short term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service  with maturities ranging from days to one year 
the principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limits 
our portfolio of long term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment grade corporate bonds  diversified among industries and individual issuers 
borrowing capacity our previous million unsecured  revolving credit facility the credit facility was set to mature in november in the second quarter of fiscal  we replaced the credit facility with a new million unsecured  revolving credit facility the credit facility with various banks  of which million may be used for issuances of letters of credit 
the credit facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases  and is currently set to mature on february  starbucks has the option  subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks  to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional million 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor  and  for us dollar denominated loans under certain circumstances  a base rate as defined in the credit facility  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on the better of i the company long term credit ratings assigned by moody and standard poor rating agencies  and ii the company fixed charge coverage ratio  pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility 
the current applicable margin is for eurocurrency rate loans and for base rate loans 
the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  which measures our ability to cover financing expenses 
as a result of the arbitrator s ruling on the kraft litigation  which is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k  the credit facility was amended on november  to exclude the impact of the litigation charge  including the impact on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of september   we were in compliance with each of these covenants  as amended 

table of contents under our commercial paper program  as approved by our board of directors  we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of billion  with individual maturities that may vary  but not exceed days from the date of issue 
amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility 
currently  we may issue up to million under our commercial paper program the million committed credit facility amount  less million in outstanding letters of credit 
the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
during fiscal and fiscal  there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs 
as of september  and september   a total of million and million  respectively  in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
in september  we issued million of year senior notes due in october  in an underwritten registered public offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april and october of each year  commencing april  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k  during the third quarter of fiscal we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to these senior notes 
we cash settled these swap agreements during the fourth quarter of fiscal at the time of the pricing of the million in senior notes 
the resulting net gains from these agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings over the life of these senior notes 
the indentures under which our million of year senior notes and our million of year senior notes were issued also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties 
as of september   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
use of cash as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k  the arbitration concluded for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with kraft 
as a result of the arbitration proceedings  starbucks was ordered to pay kraft billion in damages plus prejudgment interest and attorneys fees 
we have estimated prejudgment interest and attorneys fees to be approximately million 
we expect to fund our payment to kraft through the use of available cash on hand in the us and anticipated additional issuance of debt 
we expect to use additional available cash and short term investments  including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program  to invest in our core businesses  including new product innovations and related marketing support  as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses 
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future 
we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september  to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings 
we have not  nor do we anticipate the need to  repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs  however  in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes  which could be material 
we do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation  as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation  including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation  tax rates in effect  and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation 
we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees 
we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda 
acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees 
any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 
significant new joint ventures  acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 
other than the expected payment to kraft and normal operating expenses  cash requirements for fiscal are expected to consist primarily of new company operated stores  capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of  and equipment upgrades for  existing company operated stores  systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure  and additional investments in manufacturing capacity 
total capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately billion

cash used by financing activities for fiscal year totaled million  compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the fiscal issuance of long term debt  partially offset by an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal contractual obligations our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations debt obligations other obligations total income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
as of september   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions

debt amounts include principal maturities and scheduled interest payments on our long term debt 
other obligations include our estimated future payments associated with the accrued litigation charge and other long term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations  capital lease obligations and hedging instruments 
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business

table of contents commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk  generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products  among other items 
we purchase  roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee 
in addition to coffee  we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company operated stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations and we expect commodity prices  particularly coffee  to impact future results of operations 
for additional details see product supply in item  as well as risk factors in item a of this k 
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices  and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to various market based risks according to a market price risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk 
risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity 
we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
in general  hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs  including coffee  dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results 
in addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in commodity prices 
the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions increase decrease to net earnings increase decrease to oci increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate commodity hedges foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  british pound  and euro 
as a result  we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of september   we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 
starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie  hedged items that would occur within the period 

table of contents the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates

the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
interest rate risk debt securities we utilize short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
as of september  and september   we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding 
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september  on the fair value of starbucks debt in millions change in fair value fair value basis point increase in underlying rate basis point decrease in underlying rate senior notes senior notes available for sale securities our available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments 
the primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity 
available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available for sale securities 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale securities as of september   and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
table of contents property  plant and equipment and definite lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate such assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we measure an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for retail assets  the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level 
the fair value of a store s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store s historical performance  local market economics and the business environment impacting the store s performance 
these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
for non retail assets  fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which may include discounted cash flows  comparable transactions  or comparable company analyses 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess property plant and equipment and definite lived intangible asset impairment loss 
for the foreseeable future  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate such impairment losses 
however  as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter  or more frequently if circumstances  such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures  indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount 
if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount  we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit s past performance and forecasted growth  local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit s performance 
the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region 
these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease  among other reasons 
we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non transferable assets 
when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of  goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal 
our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment 
although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment  it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
as a result  when closing individual stores  we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets 
as noted above  if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trade names and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the intangible asset group is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount 
if we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the intangible asset group is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount  we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the intangible asset group 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the 
table of contents implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee and a discount rate that we believe reflects the level of risk associated with receiving the future cash flows attributable to the asset 
estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset group past performance and forecasted growth 
the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances 
the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business 
these estimates are subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and require management to apply judgment to estimate the reporting units or intangible asset group fair value  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance  and changes in our business strategies 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess impairment loss 
for fiscal  we determined the fair value of our reporting units and intangible asset group were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
accordingly  we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses in the foreseeable future 
however  as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations  including estimated future cash flows  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include review of our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of our position 
for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold  we record a related liability 
we adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when new information becomes available 
income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to us income taxes 
we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future 
if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes  which could be material 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability  if any  is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims  as necessary 

table of contents our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims  if any  contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k describes the company s legal and other contingent liability matters 
as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals  we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses 
any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity in future periods
