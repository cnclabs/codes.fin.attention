item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general following the recession that commenced in  the lodging industry has experienced improvement in fundamentals  which has continued into room rates  measured by the average daily rate  or adr  which typically lags occupancy growth in the early stage of a recovery  have shown upward growth 
we believe improvements in the economy will continue to positively impact the lodging industry and hotel operating results for several years to come  and we will continue to seek ways to benefit from the cyclical nature of the hotel industry 
we believe that in the prior cycle  hotel values and cash flows  for the most part  peaked in  and we believe the hotel industry may exceed these cash flows and values during the next cyclical peak 
as of december   we owned hotel properties directly  and four hotel properties through majority owned investments in joint ventures  which represents  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to our joint venture partners 
currently  all of our hotel properties are located in the united states 
in march  we acquired hotel condominium units at worldquest resort in orlando  florida for million 
also in march  with an investment of million  we converted our interest in a joint venture that held a mezzanine loan into a common equity interest and a million preferred equity interest in a new joint venture the pim highland jv that holds high quality full and select service hotel properties with  total rooms  or  net rooms excluding those attributable to our joint venture partner 
at december   we also wholly owned one mezzanine loan with a net carrying value of million and one note receivable of million in connection with a joint venture restructuring 

table of contents based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our current key priorities and financial strategies include  among other things acquisition of hotel properties  disposition of hotel properties  investing in securities  pursuing capital market activities to enhance long term shareholder value  repurchasing capital stock subject to regulatory limitations and our board of directors authorization  preserving capital  enhancing liquidity  and continuing current cost saving measures  implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability  implementing effective asset management strategies to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  financing or refinancing hotels on competitive terms  utilizing hedges and derivatives to mitigate risks  and making other investments or divestitures that our board of directors deems appropriate 
our investment strategies continue to focus on the upscale and upper upscale segments within the lodging industry 
we believe that as supply  demand  and capital market cycles change  we will be able to shift our investment strategies to take advantage of new lodging related investment opportunities as they may develop 
our board of directors may change our investment strategies at any time without shareholder approval or notice 
significant transactions in and recent developments credit facility capacity expansion and modification on february   we expanded our borrowing capacity under our million senior credit facility to an aggregate million and on september   we further expanded our borrowing capacity to an aggregate million 
we have an option  subject to lender approval  to further expand the facility to an aggregate size of million 
as part of these expansions two additional banks have been added to the participating banks in the senior credit facility 
on december   we amended the senior credit facility to reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from x to x through expiration in september at the market preferred stock offering in september  we entered into an at the market atm program with an investment banking firm  pursuant to which we may issue up to  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock and up to  shares of series d cumulative preferred stock at market prices up to million in total proceeds 
the atm program remains in effect until such time that either party elects to terminate or the share or dollar threshholds are reached 
on march   we commenced issuances of preferred stock and during the first two quarters of the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock for gross proceeds of million and  shares of series d cumulative preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
such proceeds  net of commissions and other expenses  were million for the year ended december  refinanced our million mortgage loan on may   we refinanced our million mortgage loan  due may  and having an interest rate of libor plus  with a million mortgage loan  due may with three one year extension options and an interest rate of libor plus 
as a result  our doubletree guest suites hotel property in columbus  ohio  which was one of ten hotels securing our million mortgage loan  was no longer encumbered and later sold as the nine remaining hotels secure our million mortgage loan 
disposition of hotel properties during the second quarter of we determined that the hilton el conquistador in tuscon  arizona was not to be held long term as operating cash flows were not anticipated to cover principal and interest payments of the related debt secured by this hotel 
in addition  regarding this loan  we ceased making principal and interest 
table of contents payments after july  based on our assessment  which included marketing this hotel for sale  we concluded that the carrying value of this asset would not be recoverable 
consequently  in the second quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to this hotel  which reduced its carrying value to million and represented our estimate of its fair value 
effective august   via a consensual foreclosure with our lender  a receiver appointed by pima county superior court in arizona completed taking possession and full control of this hotel 
the hotel was disposed of in december when title passed to the lender 
additionally we sold our doubletree guest suites hotel in columbus  ohio in november for net proceeds of million 
the results of operations of these hotels will be included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
refinanced our million mortgage loan on november   we refinanced our million non recourse mortgage loan set to mature in december  and having an interest rate of  with a million mortgage loan due november with three one year extension options 
the new loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of libor plus with a libor floor 
the new loan remains secured by the same five hotels including the embassy suites crystal city  embassy suites orlando airport  embassy suites santa clara  embassy suites portland and the hilton costa mesa 
liquidity and capital resources our cash position from operations is affected primarily by macro industry movements in occupancy and rate as well as our ability to control costs 
further  interest rates can greatly affect the cost of our debt service as well as the value of any financial hedges we may put in place 
we monitor industry fundamentals and interest rates very closely 
capital expenditures above our reserves will affect cash flow as well 
certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may get triggered if the performance of our hotels decline 
when these provisions are triggered  substantially all of the profit generated by our hotels is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of our various lenders 
cash is distributed to us only after certain items are paid  including deposits into ground leasing and maintenance reserves and the payment of debt service  insurance  taxes  operating expenses  and extraordinary capital expenditures and ground leasing expenses 
this could affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
also  we have entered into certain customary guaranty agreements pursuant to which we guaranty payment of any recourse liabilities of our subsidiaries or joint ventures that may result from non recourse carve outs  which include  but are not limited to fraud  misrepresentation  willful misconduct resulting in waste  misappropriations of rents following an event of default  voluntary bankruptcy filings  unpermitted transfers of collateral  and certain environmental liabilities 
certain of these guarantees represent a guaranty of material amounts  and if we are required to make payments under those guarantees  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
on february   we expanded our borrowing capacity under our million senior credit facility to an aggregate million and on september   we further expanded our borrowing capacity to an aggregate million 
we have an option  subject to lender approval  to further expand the facility to an aggregate size of million 
as part of these expansions two additional banks have been added to the participating banks in the senior credit facility 
we may use up to million for standby letters of credit 
on december   we amended the senior credit facility to reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from x to x through expiration in september in september  we entered into an at the market atm program with an investment banking firm  pursuant to which we may issue up to  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock and up to  shares of series d cumulative preferred stock at market prices up to million in total proceeds 
the atm program remains in effect until such time that either party elects to terminate or the share or dollar threshholds are reached 
on march   we commenced issuances of preferred stock and during the first two quarters of the year ended december   we issued  shares of series a cumulative preferred stock for gross proceeds of million and  shares of series d cumulative preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate proceeds  net of commissions and other expenses  were million for the year ended december  on may   we refinanced our million mortgage loan  due may  and having an interest rate of libor plus  with a million mortgage loan  due may and three one year extension options and an interest rate of libor plus 
as a result  the doubletree guest suites hotel property in columbus  ohio  which was one of ten hotels securing our million mortgage loan  was no longer encumbered and was later sold  with the nine remaining hotels securing our million mortgage loan 

table of contents on november   we refinanced our million non recourse mortgage loan set to mature in december  and having an interest rate of  with a million mortgage loan due november with three one year extension options 
the new loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of libor plus with a libor floor 
the new loan remains secured by the same five hotels including the embassy suites crystal city  embassy suites orlando airport  embassy suites santa clara  embassy suites portland and the hilton costa mesa 
in september  we entered into an atm program with an investment banking firm to offer for sale from time to time up to million of our common stock at market prices 
no shares have been sold under this atm program since its inception 
the atm program remains in effect until such time that either party elects to terminate or the million cap is reached 
our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include cash on hand  positive cash flow from operations  capital market activities  property refinancing proceeds  asset sales  and net cash derived from interest rate derivatives 
additionally  our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls  owner funded capital expenditures  new investments  and debt interest and principal payments 
items that impacted our cash flow and liquidity during the periods indicated are summarized as follows net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to increased hotel ebitda  the timing of collecting receivables from hotel guests  paying vendors  and settling with hotel managers and a decrease in restricted cash due to the release of cash deposits for certain loans and capital expenditures 
net cash flows used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   investing activities used net cash flows of million  which primarily consisted of million of capital improvements made to various hotel properties offset by cash inflows of million attributable to cash payments received on previously impaired mezzanine loans and net proceeds of million attributable to the sale of our douletree guest suites hotel in columbus  ohio 
for the year ended december   investing activities used net cash flows of million 
cash outlays consisted of million for the acquisition of a interest in pim highland jv  million for the acquisition of hotel condominiums  and million for capital improvements made to various hotel properties 
cash inflows consisted of million from the sale of four hotel properties and two condominium properties  million from repayment of mezzanine loans  and  of insurance proceeds from settlement of insurance claims 
net cash flows used in financing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash flows used in financing activities were million 
cash outlays primarily consisted of million for repayments of indebtedness  million for dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders and unit holders  million for payments of deferred loan costs and million for distributions to noncontrolling interests in joint ventures 
these cash outlays were partially offset by cash inflows of million in borrowings on indebtedness  million in proceeds from the counterparties of our interest rate derivatives and million from issuances of our series a and series e preferred stock under our atm program 
for the year ended december   net cash flows used in financing activities were million 
cash outlays consisted of million for the repurchase of our series b preferred stock  million for dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders and unit holders  million for loan modification and extension fees  million for repayments of indebtedness and capital leases  million for distributions to noncontrolling interests in joint ventures and payments of  for entering into interest rate caps 
these cash outlays were partially offset by cash inflows of million from issuance of series e preferred stock  million from borrowings on our senior credit facility  million from issuance of million shares of common stock  million from the counterparties of our interest rate derivatives  and  from a recovery of a short swing profit from a large shareholder greater than of a class of equity securities and b buy in payments from executives in connection with the issuance of operating partnership units 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under various debt and derivative agreements 
if we violate covenants in any debt or derivative agreement  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of certain debt covenants may result in us being unable to borrow unused amounts under a line of credit  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
in any event  financial covenants under our current or future debt obligations could impair our planned business strategies by limiting our ability to borrow i beyond certain amounts or ii for certain purposes 
presently  our existing financial debt covenants primarily relate to maintaining minimum debt coverage ratios  maintaining an overall minimum net worth  maintaining a maximum loan to value ratio  and maintaining an overall minimum total assets 
as of december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our debt and related agreements as amended 

table of contents mortgage and mezzanine loans are nonrecourse to the borrowers  except for customary exceptions or carve outs that trigger recourse liability to the borrowers in certain limited instances 
recourse obligations typically include only the payment of costs and liabilities suffered by lenders as a result of the occurrence of certain bad acts on the part of the borrower 
however  in certain cases  carve outs could trigger recourse obligations on the part of the borrower with respect to repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
we have entered into customary guaranty agreements pursuant to which we guaranty payment of any recourse liabilities of the borrowers that result from non recourse carve outs which include  but are not limited to  fraud  misrepresentation  willful conduct resulting in waste  misappropriations of rents following an event of default  voluntary bankruptcy filings  unpermitted transfers of collateral  and certain environmental liabilities 
in the opinion of management  none of these guaranty agreements  either individually or in the aggregate  are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
at december   our only recourse obligation is our million senior credit facility held by six banks  which expires in september currently  there is no outstanding balance on this credit facility 
the primary covenants of this senior credit facility include i the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of x through expiration ours was x at december   and ii the maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of ours was at december  
in the event we borrow on this credit facility  we may be unable to refinance a portion or all of this senior credit facility before maturity 
however  if it becomes necessary to pay down the principal balance  if any  at maturity  we believe we will be able to accomplish that with cash on hand  cash flows from operations  equity raises  or  to the extent necessary  asset sales 
based on our current level of operations  management believes that our cash flow from operations  our existing cash balances  and availability under our senior credit facility million at december  will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest and principal payments on debt  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
with respect to upcoming maturities  we will continue to proactively address our maturities 
no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue debt financing on individual properties 
we are committed to an investment strategy where we will opportunistically pursue hotel related investments as suitable situations arise 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from cash on hand  future borrowings under a credit facility or other loans  or proceeds from additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities  asset sales  and joint ventures 
however  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
we may  when conditions are suitable  consider additional capital raising opportunities 
our existing hotels are mostly located in developed areas with competing hotel properties 
future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
dividend policy 
during the years ended december  and  the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of and per share of outstanding common stock  respectively 
in december  the board of directors approved our dividend policy which anticipates a quarterly dividend payment of per share for however  the adoption of a dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends 
the board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy on a quarterly basis 
we may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions 
alternatively  we may elect to pay dividends on our common stock in cash or a combination of cash and shares of securities as permitted under federal income tax laws governing reit distribution requirements 
we may pay dividends in excess of our cash flow 
results of operations marriott international  inc marriott currently manages of our properties 
for these marriott managed hotels  the fiscal year reflects twelve weeks of operations for each of the first three quarters of the year and sixteen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year 
therefore  in any given quarterly period  period over period results will have different ending dates 
for marriott managed hotels  the fourth quarters of  and ended december   december  and december   respectively 
revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does 
table of contents not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire year 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in adr are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees

table of contents the following table illustrates the key performance indicators of the comparable hotels for the periods indicated year ended december  total hotel revenue in thousands room revenue in thousands revpar revenue per available room occupancy adr average daily rate revenue 
rooms revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended ended december  
the increase in rooms revenue was due to continued improvements in occupancy coupled with an increase in average daily rate at our comparable hotels 
during  we experienced a basis point increase in occupancy and a increase in room rates as the economy continued to improve 
food and beverage revenues experienced a similar increase of million  or  due to improved occupancy 
other hotel revenue  which consists mainly of telecommunications  parking and spa  experienced a slight improvement of  the increase in total hotel revenue includes additional revenue of million and million related to the acquisition of worldquest condominium properties in march and the assignment to us of the remaining ownership interest in a joint venture which previously held a hotel property under a triple net lease in december  respectively 
rental income from the triple net operating lease decreased million for the same reason 
other non hotel revenue was  and  for and  respectively 
hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees 
we experienced increases of million in direct expenses and million in indirect expenses and management fees in the increase in these expenses is primarily attributable to higher occupancy and higher management fees resulting from increased hotel revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses

property taxes  insurance  and other

depreciation and amortization increased million for compared to primarily due to capital improvements made at certain hotel properties since december  impairment charges 
we recorded credits to impairment charges of million and million for and  respectively  for cash received and resulting valuation adjustments on previously impaired mezzanine loans 
investments in hotel properties are reviewed for impairment for each reporting period 
we take into account the latest operating cash flows and market conditions and their impact on future projections 
for the properties that show indicators of impairment  we perform a recoverability analysis using the sum of each property s estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the property s carrying value 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions about the future operating results including disposition of the property 
in addition  the cash flow estimation periods used are based on the properties remaining useful lives to us expected holding periods 
for properties securing mortgage loans  the assumptions regarding holding periods considered our ability and intent to hold the property to or beyond the maturity of the related indebtedness 
in analyzing projected hotel properties operating cash flows  we factored in revpar growth based on data from third party sources 
in addition  the projected hotel properties operating cash flows factored in our ongoing implementation of asset management strategies to minimize operating costs 
after factoring in the expected revenue growth and the impact of company specific strategies implemented to minimize operating costs  the hotel properties estimated future undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the properties carrying values 
the analyses performed in and did not identify any properties with respect to which an impairment loss should be recognized

in  we recorded an unrealized loss of million related to losses of million on interest rate derivatives and an unrealized loss of million related to credit default swaps entered into in the fair value of interest rate derivatives is primarily based on movements in the libor forward curve and the passage of time 
the fair value of credit default swaps is based on the change in value of cmbx indices 
income tax expense 
we recorded income tax expense of million and million for and  respectively

room revenues from comparable hotels increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
the increase in room revenue was primarily due to the continued improvements in occupancy coupled with the increase in average daily rate 
during  we experienced a basis point increase in occupancy and a increase in room rates as the economy continues to improve 
food and beverage revenues from comparable hotels experienced a similar increase of million  or  due to improved occupancy 
other hotel revenue from comparable hotels experienced an increase of million 
rental income of million was recognized through december  for a hotel property that was leased to a third party under a triple net basis 
effective december   we were assigned the remaining ownership interest in the joint venture which previously held a hotel property under a triple net lease 
the lease agreement was canceled and the operating results of this hotel property have been included in our consolidated statements of operations  which accounted for a total of million of room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues 
the remaining increase in total hotel revenue of million is attributable to the acquisition of the worldquest condominium properties in march no interest income from notes receivable was recorded for as the remaining two mezzanine loans in our loan portfolio as of december  were impaired in the previous two years 
interest income on notes receivable was million for we recorded a credit to impairment charges of million and million for and  respectively 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with the borrower of the mezzanine loan which was secured by a hotel property portfolio and scheduled to mature in april the borrower repaid the loan for million

during  impairment charges included a credit of million on the cash settlement of a mezzanine loan that was previously impaired 

table of contents other non hotel revenue was  for and  for hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and management fees 
we experienced increases of million in direct expenses and million in indirect expenses and management fees in the increase in these expenses is primarily attributable to higher occupancy and higher management fees resulting from increased hotel revenues  and higher sales and marketing expenses 
the worldquest condominium properties incurred million in total hotel operating expenses and the consolidation of the previous triple net lease hotel property contributed  increase in total hotel operating expenses during the direct expenses were of total hotel revenue for and for property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other decreased million for to million 
the decrease in comparable hotels is primarily due to a million reduction in property taxes resulting from our continued successful appeals as we secured significant reductions in the assessed value related to certain of our hotel properties and a reduction in deductibles for losses of  the decrease in these expenses also reflects a gain of  recognized on an insurance claim and other activities in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million for compared to primarily due to increase in depreciation expense for capital improvements made at certain hotel properties 
the increase was partially offset by decrease in depreciation for certain assets that had been fully depreciated during impairment charges 
we recorded a credit to impairment charges of million in  for cash received and valuation adjustments on the previously impaired mezzanine loans 
the impairment charges for our continuing operations were million for we recorded million of impairment charges on mezzanine loans and a credit of million related to the valuation adjustments on previously impaired loans in our mezzanine loan portfolio 
of the total impairment charges of million for  million was the valuation allowance recorded for the extended stay hotels mezzanine loan and million for four other mezzanine notes 
the impairment charge recorded on hotel properties for and of million and million  respectively  are included in the operating results of discontinued operations 
in evaluating possible loan impairment  we analyze our notes receivable individually and collectively for possible loan losses in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
based on the analysis  if we conclude that no loans are individually impaired  we then further analyze the specific characteristics of the loans  based on other authoritative guidance to determine if there would be probable losses in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
the loans we have had in our portfolio were collateralized by hotel properties 
some loans were collateralized by single hotel properties and others by hotel portfolios 
the hotel properties were in different geographic locations  had different ages and a few of the properties had completed significant renovations which had a significant impact on the value of the underlying collateral 
the hotel properties included independent and nationally recognized brands in all segments and classes including luxury  economy  extended stay  full service  and select service 
in addition  our loan assets varied by position in the related borrower s capital structure  ranging from junior mortgage participations to mezzanine loans 
the terms of our notes or participations were structured based on the different features of the related collateral and the priority in the borrower s capital structure 
the authoritative accounting guidance requires that an individual loan not impaired individually be included in the assessment of the loss in a group of loans only if specific characteristics of the loan indicate that it is probable that there would be an incurred loss in a group of loans with similar characteristics 
as loans in our portfolio have significantly different risk factors and characteristics  such as different maturity terms  different types and classes of collateral  different interest rate structures  and different priority status  we concluded that the characteristics of the loans within the portfolio were not sufficiently similar as to allow an evaluation of these loans as a group for possible impairment within the authoritative accounting guidance 
investments in hotel properties are reviewed for impairment for each reporting period 
we take into account the latest operating cash flows and market conditions and their impact on future projections 
for the properties that showed indicators of impairment  we perform a recoverability analysis using the sum of each property s estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the property s carrying value 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions about the future operating results including disposition of the property 
in addition  the cash flow estimation periods used are based on the properties remaining useful lives to us expected holding periods 
for properties securing mortgage loans  the assumptions regarding holding periods considered our ability and intent to hold the property to or beyond the maturity of the related indebtedness 
in analyzing projected hotel properties operating cash flows  we factored in revpar growth based on data from third party sources 
in addition  the projected hotel properties operating cash flows factored in our ongoing implementation of asset management strategies to minimize operating costs 
after factoring in the expected revenue growth and the impact of company 
table of contents specific strategies implemented to minimize operating costs  the hotel properties estimated future undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the properties carrying values 
with the exception of the three hilton hotel properties  the analyses performed in did not identify any other properties with respect to which an impairment loss should be recognized

inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities are subject to inflation as well 
seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months 
this seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future
