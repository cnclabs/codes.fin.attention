table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  and as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the expansion of our tad tissue offerings may not proceed as anticipated 
in connection with our long term growth strategy  we recently built a new tad paper machine and installed four converting lines at our facility in shelby  north carolina and upgraded our tad manufacturing capabilities at our las vegas  nevada facility 
as these are recently completed projects  we are still in the process of optimizing the operation of the new and upgraded equipment  the quality of the tad products being produced at these facilities  the converting and distribution of our tad and existing tissue products and the sales mix of our new tad product offerings with existing product lines 
we are also working with existing customers as well as new customers to develop marketing and sales programs in connection with the new tad products 
these ongoing efforts entail numerous risks  including potential mechanical and other operational problems in the start up phase of operations of this complex manufacturing equipment  difficulties in integrating the new tad products with existing products  difficulties in integrating the new operations and personnel with our other tissue operations and market acceptance of the new tad products 
any of these risks  if realized  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  such events could also divert management attention from other business concerns 
additionally  over the past few years  several new or refurbished tad paper machines have been completed or announced by our competitors  including private label competitors  that will result in a substantial increase in the supply of tad tissue in the north american market 
this increase in supply of tad products  as well as the effects of that increased supply in displacing existing conventional tissue product sales  could have a material adverse effect on the price of tad tissue products and on the market demand for conventional tissue products  which will continue to represent a majority of our total production for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders from  or changes in prices in regards to  any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in  our consumer products segment derived approximately of its net sales and we derived approximately of our total net sales from three customers 
if we lose any of these customers or if the terms of our relationship with them becomes less favorable to us  our net sales would decline  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have experienced increased price and promotion competition for our consumer products customers  which can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our financial condition 
some of our customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products themselves that they purchase from us 
our pulp and paperboard segment sells its products to a large number of customers  although certain customers have historically purchased a significant amount of our pulp or paperboard products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers  including our largest customers  that ensure a continuing level of business from them 
in addition  our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments 
our relationship with our large customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices 
if we lose one or more of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them  we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed 
in addition  our focus on these large accounts could affect our ability to serve our smaller accounts  particularly when product supply is tight and we are not able to fully satisfy orders for these smaller accounts 
we have increased our dependence on external sources of wood pulp  which subjects our business and results of operations to potentially significant fluctuations in the price of market pulp 
in  our consumer products segment sourced approximately of its annual pulp supply from our pulp and paperboard segment  while the cellu tissue operations we acquired historically relied entirely on external suppliers for wood pulp 
consequently  due to the integration of the cellu tissue operations at the end of  our consumer products segment sourced approximately of its pulp requirements externally during the increased dependence on external sources of wood pulp increases our exposure to fluctuations in prices for wood pulp  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  operations and cash flows 
pulp prices can  and have  changed significantly from one period to the next 
for example  our external pulp costs decreased from to the volatility of pulp prices can adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trails the increases in pulp prices 
we have not hedged these risks 

table of contents changes in the cost and availability of wood fiber used in production of our products may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
wood fiber is the principal raw material used to create wood pulp  which in turn is used to manufacture our pulp and paperboard products and consumer products 
in  our wood fiber costs were of our cost of sales 
much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process in lewiston  idaho  is the by product of sawmill operations 
as a result  the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry 
the significant reduction in home building over the past four years resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many sawmills 
the price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile until the housing market recovers and sawmill operations increase 
additionally  the supply and price of wood fiber can be negatively affected by weather and other events 
the effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations 
if we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all  our costs will increase and financial results  operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
the cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our business 
we use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes  including latex and polyethylene  many of which are petroleum based chemicals 
in  our chemical costs were of our cost of sales 
prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile 
in addition  chemical suppliers that use petroleum based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may  due to supply shortages and cost increases  ration the amount of chemicals available to us  and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business  if we are able to obtain them at all 
our manufacturing operations utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas and our energy requirements  particularly natural gas  will increase significantly as a result of operations at our north carolina facility 
in  our energy costs were of our cost of sales 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade  which in turn affects our cost of sales 
we purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand  geopolitical events  government regulation  and natural disasters 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
increases in our transportation costs or disruptions in our transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business  particularly our consumer products business  is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us 
in  our transportation costs were of our cost of sales 
the costs of these transportation services are primarily determined by fuel prices  which have steadily increased since and are affected by geopolitical and economic events 
we have not been in the past  and may not be in the future  able to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers 
if we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers  our gross margins may be materially adversely affected 
if any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis 
shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions  labor strikes or other events 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation  negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
larger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations 
the markets for our products are highly competitive  and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products 

table of contents our consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products 
our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers  such as procter gamble  and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products  such as georgia pacific and kimberly clark 
these companies are far larger than us  have much greater sales  marketing and research and development resources than we do  and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale 
in addition  because of their size and resources  these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete 
our ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors  including manufacturing capacity  general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes 
our pulp and paperboard business competes with international paper  meadwestvaco  georgia pacific  rocktenn and international producers  most of whom are much larger than us 
any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry  which could cause downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials  such as plastic  for their products 
an increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the consolidation of paperboard converting businesses  including through the acquisition and integration of such converting business by larger competitors of ours  could result in a loss of customers and sales on the part of our pulp and paperboard business  which does not include paperboard converting facilities or capabilities 
a loss of paperboard customers or sales as a result of consolidations and integrations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
changes in demand for certain products could adversely affect our financial results 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to adjust to increases and decreases in demand 
if we are unable to respond to increases in demand  we may need to limit deliveries of some orders for existing customers  which could harm our reputation and our long term relationships with these customers 
currently  we are unable to meet all of the demand from existing and potential customers for bathroom tissue due to very high demand 
alternatively  if we experience a decrease in demand for certain products  we may incur significant costs in revising our manufacturing plan 
if we are not able to respond to changes in demand for our products in a timely manner  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
competitors branded products and private label tad products could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our consumer products compete with well known  branded products  as well as other private label products 
inherent risks in our competitive strategy include whether our products will receive direct and retail customer acceptance  new product offerings by competitors  the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels  and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do 
we have only recently completed new  or upgraded existing  tad facilities that allow us to produce tad bathroom tissue 
if we are unable to offer our existing customers  or new customers  tissue products comparable to branded products or private label competitive tad products  and in sufficient quantities  we may lose business or we may not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower margin products  all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our qualification to retain  or ability to utilize  tax credits associated with alternative fuels or cellulosic biofuels and the tax treatment associated with receipt of such credits are uncertain 
in  we received refundable federal tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit was equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
this tax credit expired on december  in  we recorded pre tax income of million related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc 
we have not recorded any pre tax income since relating to the afmtc 
there is relatively little guidance regarding the afmtc and the law governing the issue is complex 
accordingly  there remains uncertainty as to our qualification to receive the tax credit in  as well as to whether we will be entitled to retain the amounts we received upon further review by the internal revenue service  or irs 
in addition  while it is our position that payments received or credits taken in relation to the afmtc should not be subject to corporate income tax  there can be no assurance as to whether or not the amounts we have received will be subject to taxation 
as of december  we have recorded accrued taxes on uncertain tax positions related to the afmtc of million 
in  the irs began conducting an audit of our to tax years  which is further discussed in note  income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are also registered with the irs as a cellulosic biofuel producer  which enables us to claim the per gallon cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  in regards to black liquor produced and used as a fuel by us at our pulp mills in we have changed  and may in the future make additional changes in  our position as to some or all of the credits we claimed under the afmtc on our federal income tax form  provided we believe we will have sufficient future federal taxable earnings to enable us to carry forward the credits potentially available under the cbpc 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the cbpc 
congress has identified the elimination or modification of the cbpc in connection with black liquor as a possible revenue source 
such legislative action could limit or eliminate our ability to convert afmtc gallons to cbpc gallons and or cbpc gallons to afmtc gallons and  accordingly  limit or eliminate our ability to claim carry forward credits 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures  which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  water discharges  air emissions  hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup 
environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
increased regulatory activity at the state  federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites 
compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part 
we are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes 
federal  state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities  which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits 
failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures  install pollution control equipment  or take other remedial actions  such as product recalls or labeling changes 
we also may be required to make additional expenditures  which could be significant  relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis 
in  we were notified that the us environmental protection agency  or epa  submitted a civil referral to the us department of justice  or doj  alleging violations of the clean air act stemming from an epa investigation at our lewiston  idaho pulp facility 
prior to the filing of any formal action  we and the doj agreed to discuss the resolution of the allegations  and the parties entered into an agreement to toll the statute of limitations 
the tolling agreement expires on march   unless further extended by the parties 
discussions with the doj and epa are ongoing 
however  this matter could result in civil penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures  install pollution control equipment  or take other remedial actions 
we own properties  conduct or have conducted operations at properties  and have assumed indemnity obligations in connection with our spin off in from potlatch  for properties or operations where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years  including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary 
consequently  we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities 
the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis 
we must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in addition  our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance 
these scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which a shutdown occurs 

table of contents unexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities 
for example  in we curtailed operations at our cypress bend  arkansas  pulp and paperboard facility as the result of an electrical malfunction and curtailed operations at our wiggins  mississippi  consumer products facility as the result of a fire 
disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances  including prolonged power outages  mechanical or process failures  shortages of raw materials  natural catastrophes  disruptions in the availability of transportation  labor disputes  terrorism  changes in or non compliance with environmental or safety laws and the lack of availability of services from any of our facilities key sole suppliers 
any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods  regardless of the reason for the shutdown 
those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks  depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations  and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition 
we use information technology  or it  systems in various aspects of our operations  including enterprise resource planning  management of inventories and customer sales 
some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time 
additionally  with the acquisition of cellu tissue  we have different legacy it systems which we are continuing to integrate 
if one of these systems was to fail  or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems  we may suffer disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems 
united states and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results 
us and global economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results 
for example  the away from home consumer paper products market has experienced a decline because of the slowdown in the travel and restaurant industries as a result of the ongoing economic downturn 
recessed economic conditions affect our business in a number of ways  including causing i increased pressure for price concessions from customers  ii declines in domestic and global demand for paperboard  iii shifts in customer purchases that affect the mix of our product sales  iv decreased or low housing starts  which increase production costs due to lower wood fiber supplies  and v financial distress or insolvency for certain customers which could affect our sales volumes or our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from those customers 
our company sponsored pension plans and one of our multiemployer pension plans are currently underfunded  and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans  reducing cash available for our business 
we have company sponsored pension plans covering certain of our salaried and hourly employees 
the significant decline in the securities markets beginning in and resulting substantial decline in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by these plans  coupled with a low interest rate environment resulting in higher liability valuations  have caused these plans to be underfunded so that the projected benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
at december   our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded in the aggregate by approximately million 
as a result of underfunding  we are required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans 
in  we contributed million to these pension plans 
we may be required to make increased annual contributions to our pension plans in future years  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
we also contribute to two multiemployer pension plans 
the amount of our annual contributions to each of these plans is negotiated with the plan and the bargaining unit representing our employees covered by the plan 
in we contributed approximately million to these plans and in future years we may be required to make increased annual contributions  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
in addition  in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from any multiemployer plan that is underfunded  we would be liable for a proportionate share of such multiemployer plan unfunded vested benefits  referred to as a withdrawal liability 
a withdrawal liability is considered a contingent liability 
based on the limited information available from the plan administrator of one of our multiemployer plans  which we cannot independently validate  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal from or termination of that plan would likely be material to our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any multiemployer plan that is underfunded  and such employer cannot satisfy its obligations under the multiemployer plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan unfunded vested benefits which could result in an increase to our required annual contributions 

table of contents our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change 
in addition to our pension plans  we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our current and former us salaried and hourly employees 
our retiree health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally  which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years 
our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension costs 
significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
cyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flow of our pulp and paperboard business 
our pulp and paperboard business is particularly affected by cyclical market conditions 
we may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand  and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime 
in addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes  production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels 
our results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness 
we are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand 
we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers for certain raw materials required for the production of our products 
our dependence on a limited number of third party suppliers  and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials  involve several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality  and delivery schedules 
we cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements 
any supply interruption in limited raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be identified and qualified 
although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials  we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms 
any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could interrupt production of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
as of december   of our full time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements 
as these agreements expire  we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us 
we currently have no collective bargaining agreements under negotiation 
any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes  lockouts or other labor actions 
any such labor actions  including work slowdowns in the future or stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
additional expansion of our business through construction of new facilities or acquisitions may not proceed as anticipated 
in addition to the acquisition of cellu tissue and construction of our north carolina facility  in the future we may build other converting and papermaking facilities  pursue acquisitions of existing facilities  or both 
we may be unable to identify future suitable building locations or acquisition targets 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate  or at all 
any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner  any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash and short term investments  an increase in our indebtedness  or both  and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management attention from other business concerns 

table of contents the indentures for our outstanding notes that we issued in and  and the credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility  contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business 
the indentures governing our outstanding notes that we issued in and  and the credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility  contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to undergo a change in control  sell assets  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  create liens  consolidate  merge  or sell substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  engage in new lines of business  and enter into sale and lease back transactions 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business in our discretion could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities 
in addition  our senior secured revolving credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to when availability falls below million or an event of default exists 
events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet this financial test  and we cannot assure you that we will meet it 
our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility or the indentures governing our outstanding notes  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated 
if we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes  our senior secured revolving credit facility or our other debt instruments  an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur 
if an event of default does occur  it could trigger a default under our other debt instruments  prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings  and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable 
our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt 
even if we were able to secure additional financing  it may not be available on favorable terms 
to service our indebtedness  we must generate significant cash flows 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including our outstanding notes  and to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties

unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise indicates  references in this report to clearwater paper corporation  we  our  the company and us refer to clearwater paper corporation and its subsidiaries 
on december   we acquired cellu tissue holdings  inc  or cellu tissue 
the results discussed below include cellu tissue operating results for the period december  forward 
overview highlights consumer products expansion in december  we announced the start up of our new through air dried  or tad  paper machine and the completion of two additional converting lines that became operational in the fourth quarter of the completion of the tad paper machine and a total of four converting lines in shelby  north carolina  along with another converting line we expect to install in  is expected to increase our ultra and premium offerings to existing and new customers 
also in the fourth quarter  we completed upgrades to our tad tissue manufacturing facility in las vegas  nevada 
overall  our tad tissue expansion project  or tad project  will allow us to supply a full range of tad products  including paper towels and bath tissue  to customers across the us  while reducing transportation costs 
we believe this project  along with our existing manufacturing capabilities  establishes us as the only private label tissue products company in the us to offer a full line of tissue products to customers 
we estimate the tad project will cost approximately million  excluding capitalized interest 
as of december   we have incurred a total of million in tad project costs  of which million was incurred in we expect the remaining balance of approximately million to be spent in in addition  we capitalized a total of million of interest related to the tad project  of which million was capitalized in in august  first quality tissue se  llc  or first quality  filed a lawsuit against metso paper  the company we contracted with to supply the tad paper machine to our north carolina facility  seeking to enjoin metso paper from delivering the tad paper machine based on first quality s agreement with metso paper 
on june   the united states district court for the district of south carolina ruled in favor of clearwater paper and metso paper and denied first quality s claim to enjoin metso paper from delivering the tad paper machine to us 
integration of cellu tissue holdings  inc on december   we acquired cellu tissue  which included nine tissue manufacturing facilities located in the southern  midwestern and eastern united states and one facility in eastern canada 
these facilities have allowed us to better serve existing private label grocery customers by creating a broad manufacturing footprint geographically and have enabled us to expand into new private label and other tissue channels 
we recognized million and million of net cost savings from synergies relating to the acquisition during the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and expect to achieve to million annually in net cost savings from synergies beginning in capital allocation on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the stock repurchase program  we were authorized to repurchase shares in the open market or as otherwise determined by management  subject to market conditions  business opportunities and other factors 
during  we repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock at a total cost of million  representing an average price of per share 
we completed this repurchase program in the fourth quarter of the total number of shares repurchased under this program was  at an aggregate cost of million and an average price of per share 

table of contents on february   in an event subsequent to the close of our fiscal year  and in conjunction with the issuance of million of aggregate principal senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in in addition  through the same subsequent event  we announced that our board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of million of our common stock  to be funded by a portion of the proceeds from the notes 
we intend to complete this share repurchase program during through open market purchases  negotiated transactions or other means 
business we are a leading producer of private label tissue and premium bleached paperboard products 
our products are primarily wood pulp based and predominately manufactured in the us our business is organized into two reporting segments our consumer products segment manufactures and sells a complete line of at home tissue products in each tissue category  including bathroom tissue  paper towels  napkins and facial tissue 
we also manufacture away from home tissue  or afh  machine glazed tissue and parent rolls for external sales 
our integrated manufacturing and converting operations and geographic footprint enable us to deliver a broad range of cost competitive products with brand equivalent quality to our consumer products customers 
in  our consumer products segment had net sales of billion  representing approximately of our total net sales 
our pulp and paperboard segment manufactures and markets bleached paperboard for the high end segment of the packaging industry and is a leading producer of solid bleach sulfate paperboard 
this segment also produces hardwood and softwood pulp  which is primarily used as the basis for our paperboard products  and slush pulp  which it supplies to our consumer products segment 
in  our pulp and paperboard segment had net sales of million  representing approximately of our total net sales 
developments and trends in our business net sales prices for our consumer tissue products are affected by competitive conditions and the prices of branded tissue products 
tissue has historically been one of the strongest segments of the paper and forest products industry due to its steady demand growth and the absence of severe supply imbalances that occur in a number of other paper segments 
our consumer products segment competes based on product quality  customer service and price 
we deliver customer focused business solutions by assisting in managing product assortment  category management  and pricing and promotion optimization 
demand and pricing for our pulp and paperboard products are largely determined by macro economic conditions around the world 
paperboard prices softened modestly in compared to our pulp and paperboard business experiences cyclical market conditions and  as a result  historical prices for our products and sales volumes have been volatile 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand for our products 
product supply in the industry is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing production  which tends to increase during periods when prices remain strong 
in addition  currency exchange rates affect us supplies of paperboard  as non us manufacturers are attracted to the us market when the dollar is relatively strong 
our paperboard business  through exports denominated in us dollars  has benefited significantly from general weakness in the us dollar over the past few years 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our markets 
in addition  our businesses are capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs  large capital outlays and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition  particularly during periods of reduced demand 
some of our competitors have lower production costs and greater buying power and  as a result  may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases 
net sales consist of sales of consumer tissue and pulp and paperboard  net of discounts  returns and allowances and any sales taxes collected 

table of contents operating costs prices for our principal operating cost items are variable and directly affect our results of operations 
for example  as economic conditions improve  we normally would expect at least some upward pressure on these operating costs 
competitive market conditions can limit our ability to pass cost increases through to our customers 
year ended december  dollars in thousands cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales purchased pulp chemicals transportation chips  sawdust and logs energy maintenance and repairs packaging supplies depreciation and amortization includes internal and external transportation costs 
excluding related labor costs 
purchased pulp 
we purchase a significant amount of the pulp from external suppliers to supply our consumer products  and  to a lesser extent  our pulp and paperboard manufacturing facilities 
for  total purchased pulp costs were of our cost of sales  representing a decrease of percentage points compared to this decrease in purchased pulp costs was primarily due to lower average external pulp prices in  which were at record highs in  and our continued focus on using our internally produced pulp at our consumer products facilities 
in we expect to continue using our lower cost internally produced pulp at our consumer products facilities to help defray our pulp costs 
chemicals 
we consume a substantial amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paperboard 
the chemicals we generally use include polyethylene  caustic  starch  sodium chlorate  latex and specialty paper process chemicals 
a large portion of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  particularly in the pulp making process  are petroleum based and are impacted by petroleum prices 
chemical costs for increased million  or percentage points  over costs  primarily as a result of increased production volumes and  to a lesser degree  higher starch and caustic pricing 
transportation 
fuel prices significantly impact transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities  internal inventory transfers and delivery of our finished products to customers 
changing fuel prices particularly affect our margins for consumer products because we supply customers throughout the us and transport significant numbers of unconverted parent rolls from our tissue mills to our geographically dispersed tissue converting facilities 
our transportation costs for  compared to  decreased as less fuel was needed because of continuing optimization of shipping to and from our expanded converting facilities resulting from the cellu tissue acquisition 
because of our expanded size  we were also able to continue negotiating better fuel rates and surcharges 
in addition  as a result of the sale of our lewiston  idaho sawmill in november  overall transportation costs were lower for compared to chips  sawdust and logs 
we purchase chips  sawdust and logs used to manufacture pulp 
overall costs for chips  sawdust and logs for decreased compared to  both in dollars and as a percentage of cost of sales  primarily due to the sale of our lewiston  idaho sawmill in november excluding the effects of our former sawmill  the cost of chips  sawdust and logs decreased slightly when compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower hardwood usage  which was attributable to the use of a higher proportion of lower priced sawdust  and lower overall pricing at our lewiston  idaho  pulp and paperboard mill 
in  as a result of our acquisition of a wood chipping facility at the end of  we expect to be less exposed to market costs for chips  sawdust and logs 

table of contents energy 
we use energy in the form of electricity  hog fuel  steam and natural gas to operate our mills 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade 
we have taken steps  and intend to continue to take steps  to reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices through conservation 
in addition  cogeneration facilities that produce steam and electricity at our east hartford  connecticut  lewiston  idaho and menominee  michigan manufacturing sites help to lower our energy costs 
however  tad tissue production involves greater natural gas usage than conventional tissue manufacturing and  as a result  we expect our natural gas requirements will increase due to the start up of our north carolina tad paper machine 
to help mitigate our exposure to changes in natural gas prices  from time to time we have used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements 
as of december   these contracts covered approximately of our expected natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities for energy costs for were lower than those in due to lower usage as a result of the sale of our lewiston  idaho  sawmill and lower natural gas and electricity prices 
our energy costs in future periods will continue to depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on our ability to reduce our energy usage 
maintenance and repairs 
we incur significant costs to maintain our manufacturing equipment 
we perform routine maintenance on our machines and periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
maintenance and repair costs  including major maintenance and repairs  are expensed as incurred 
major equipment maintenance and repairs in our pulp and paperboard segment also require maintenance shutdowns annually at our idaho facility  historically  and approximately every months at our arkansas facility  which increases costs and may reduce net sales in the quarters in which the major maintenance shutdowns occur 
we have optimized the major maintenance process at our idaho facility and expect that facility to also be on an month schedule going forward 
in the first quarter of  we had combined days of scheduled machine downtime for the two paperboard machines at our idaho pulp and paperboard mill and incurred approximately million in major maintenance costs  excluding labor  compared to major maintenance costs of million and million  respectively  at the same mill in the first and third quarters of there was no major maintenance in the second and third quarters of as a result of a decision to defer a portion of our expected major maintenance costs at our arkansas facility of million originally planned for the fourth quarter of we spent million in the fourth quarter of  and expect to incur the remainder in the first quarter of in  we expect to spend a total of approximately million for planned major maintenance  which consists of an estimated million at our arkansas facility during the first quarter and an estimated million at our idaho facility  which is largely expected to be incurred during the third quarter 
in addition to ongoing maintenance and repair costs  we make capital expenditures to increase our operating capacity and efficiency  to improve safety at our facilities and to comply with environmental laws 
excluding million of expenditures for our tad project  we spent million on capital expenditures during  compared to million in capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which includes an estimated million associated with the completion of our tad project 
packaging supplies 
as a significant producer of private label consumer tissue products  we package to order for retail chains  wholesalers and cooperative buying organizations 
in connection with sales to these customers  we incur expenses related to the unique packaging of our products for direct retail sale to consumers 
for the year ended december   packaging costs were lower than those in primarily due to procurement synergies resulting from the cellu tissue acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
we record depreciation expense associated with our plant and equipment and amortization expense associated with our definite lived intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expense for was higher than due primarily to additional depreciation associated with our tad project 
we anticipate a further increase in due primarily to a full year of depreciation associated with our north carolina tad paper machine  which started up in december other 
other costs not mentioned in the above table primarily consist of wage and benefit expenses and miscellaneous operating costs 
although period cut offs and inventory levels can impact cost of sales  we would expect this impact to be relatively steady as a percentage of cost of sales on a year over year basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and associated costs for sales and administrative personnel  as well as commission expenses related to sales of our products 
our total selling  general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in  with the increase primarily a result of higher wage and benefits expense  partially associated with the completion of our north carolina facility  as well as increased incentive compensation expense  expense related to the first quality metso paper litigation and additional expenses associated with the integration of cellu tissue and achieving net cost saving synergies 

table of contents interest expense interest expense in was mostly comprised of interest on our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due issued in october  which we refer to as the notes  and our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due issued in june  which we refer to as the notes 
interest expense also includes amortization of deferred finance costs associated with all of our notes and our revolving credit facility 
interest expense in was partially offset by our capitalization of interest for our tad project 
interest expense before reductions for capitalized interest in decreased slightly compared to primarily as a result of the third quarter redemption of our industrial revenue bonds 
in january  we issued the notes 
a portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to redeem the notes in february as a result of the issuance of the notes at an interest rate significantly lower than the notes  our interest expense is expected to decrease by approximately million on an annual basis 
however  this favorable change in interest expense associated with our notes will be more than offset by a decrease in capitalized interest  as no capitalized interest is expected in compared to million recorded in income taxes income taxes are based on reported earnings and tax rates in jurisdictions in which our operations occur and offices are located  adjusted for available credits  changes in valuation allowances and differences in reported earnings and taxable income using current law and enacted tax rates 
the annual rates  including discrete items  for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the reasons for the change in the tax rate from compared to was primarily due to four items 
the first was a decrease in the rate attributable to state tax credits 
the second was a decrease due to a remeasurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities using anticipated future tax rates that will be in effect when the underlying assets and liabilities reverse 
the third was a reduction of the valuation allowance relating to foreign tax credits 
lastly  the decision in the first quarter of to convert certain gallons of alternative fuel originally claimed in under the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc  which had been converted by us in to the cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  back to gallons under the afmtc and associated uncertain tax position 
the low annual rate in was primarily due to benefits from the cbpc and reductions in our provision for uncertain tax positions relating to the afmtc 
the estimated annual effective tax rate for is expected to be approximately

these favorable comparisons were partially offset by lower external pulp shipments  due to increased internal usage of pulp we produce  and lower pulp and paperboard net selling prices 
these items are discussed further below under discussion of business segments 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased percentage points in to of net sales  compared to of net sales in the favorable change in cost of sales was due primarily to lower costs for purchased pulp  chips  sawdust and logs  energy  and transportation  partially offset by higher chemical costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  during compared to the increase was primarily a result of higher wage and benefits expense  increased incentive compensation expense  expense related to the first quality metso paper litigation and additional expenses associated with the integration of cellu tissue and achieving net cost saving synergies

shipments increased due to increased case sales of retail tissue products  which were largely attributable to an increase in shipments from our north carolina converting facility  and higher non retail shipments in the increase in net selling prices was primarily due to a price increase for our retail tissue products implemented in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  partially offset by lower non retail pricing 
operating income  which more than doubled during with an increase of million  outpaced the growth of net sales due to lower purchased pulp and energy costs  as well as lower overall transportation and packaging costs primarily attributable to net cost saving synergies from the integration of cellu tissue 
these improvements were partially offset by increased staffing  training and startup costs associated with our north carolina paper making and converting facilities  higher incentive compensation expense  increased commission expense and a loss on the sale of legacy cellu tissue foam manufacturing assets 
pulp and paperboard years ended december  dollars in thousands except per ton amounts net sales operating income percent of net sales shipments short tons paperboard pulp sales price per short ton paperboard pulp net sales for our pulp and paperboard segment were down million  or  during compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of our lewiston  idaho sawmill in november  which accounted for million of the segment net sales in paperboard net sales increased slightly in due to a increase in shipments that was partially offset by a decrease in net selling prices resulting primarily from market pressure 
the higher overall paperboard net sales in were more than offset by a decrease in net sales of external pulp  which was largely the result of increased internal usage by our consumer products segment of pulp that we produced 
operating income in increased by compared to  primarily due to lower costs of energy and purchased pulp  as well as benefits from the sale of our lewiston  idaho sawmill

cost of sales cost of sales was of net sales for  compared to for the million increase in was primarily due to higher overall costs related to the inclusion of cellu tissue s operations  as well as integration costs associated with those operations 
other factors that contributed to higher cost of sales in included wage and benefit costs associated with our north carolina expansion  higher costs for packaging supplies and chemicals  higher transportation costs due to higher fuel prices and increased shipments  and retroactive pay related to labor contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales for compared to as a result of economies of scale relating to the significantly higher sales

the decrease in net selling prices is a result of the addition of cellu tissue products and the resulting change in the mix of tissue grades sold 
the cellu tissue facilities produce a broad range of products and some tissue grades that sell at lower price points than the tissue products produced by the consumer products segment historically 
the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher wage and benefit costs associated with the startup of our north carolina facilities  relocation and severance costs associated with the acquisition of cellu tissue  and retroactive pay related to labor contracts 
in addition  costs were higher for packaging supplies  transportation costs associated with higher fuel prices and additional shipments  depreciation and amortization resulting from the cellu tissue acquisition and repair and maintenance expenses associated with the cellu tissue facilities 
lower pulp costs  due to decreasing costs in the second half of  partially offset the unfavorable comparisons 
pulp and paperboard years ended december  dollars in thousands except per ton amounts net sales operating income percent of net sales shipments short tons paperboard pulp sales price per short ton paperboard pulp net sales for the pulp and paperboard segment were million  or  higher in compared to the increase in net sales over was largely due to an increase of in paperboard prices and slightly higher paperboard shipments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in external pulp shipments due primarily to increased internal usage 
operating income increased million in compared to the same period in the increase was largely attributable to higher net selling prices for paperboard and lower maintenance  purchased paper and wood fiber costs  all of which were partially offset by higher chemical costs

some of these limitations are ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital assets  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not include cash pension payments  ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda i as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation  ii to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and iii because our credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes  notes and notes use measures similar to ebitda to measure our compliance with certain covenants 
the following table provides our ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the periods presented  as well as a reconciliation to net earnings years ended december  in thousands net earnings interest expense  net of interest income income tax provision depreciation and amortization expense ebitda loss on sale of foam assets expense associated with metso litigation lewiston  idaho sawmill sale related adjustments cellu tissue acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda the total impact of the sawmill sale and related adjustments on the pulp and paperboard segment was million of expense 
the net impact to the company was million of net expense in primarily due to offsetting lifo inventory liquidation and other adjustments recorded at the corporate level 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table presents information regarding our cash flows for the years ended december   and cash flows summary years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for significantly increased compared to due primarily to cash generated from working capital  compared to cash used for working capital in  as well as higher earnings  after adjusting for noncash items 
these increases were partially offset by a million excess tax benefit from equity based compensation arrangements in  a million increase in taxes receivable in compared to a slight decrease in  and an million increase in contributions to our qualified pension plans in compared to for  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the cash receipt of million during from the federal government primarily related to the afmtc claimed in working capital increased million in due to increased receivables and inventories from increased sales and our north carolina expansion  as well as a reduction in our accounts payable 
these changes were partially offset by higher earnings in  after adjusting for noncash items 
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  compared to the increase was largely due to increased capital spending for plant and equipment in  primarily associated with our tad project  as well as a million reduction in the amount of cash provided from the conversion of short term investments into cash in compared to net cash used for investing activities decreased by million in compared to this was largely due to our acquisition of cellu tissue in for million  offset by cash acquired of million 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to the cash outlays associated with our new converting and manufacturing facilities in north carolina and capital improvement projects at cellu tissue facilities 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities was million in  compared with million in cash used for financing activities in consisted of payments totaling million for minimum tax withholdings associated with settlement and distribution of equity based awards and million for treasury stock purchases  partially offset by an excess tax benefit of million associated with the equity based awards settled and distributed in net cash used for financing activities was million for  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the use of cash in primarily consisted of million used to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our million stock repurchase program and million used in the redemption of the remaining principal amount on our outstanding irbs and associated costs 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to financing related to the cellu tissue acquisition  as discussed below 
capital resources due to the competitive and cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  as well as an uncertain economic environment  there is uncertainty regarding the amount of cash flows we will generate during the next twelve months

table of contents cityforest industrial bonds prior to our acquisition of cellu tissue  cellu tissue cityforest llc  or cityforest  a wholly owned subsidiary of cellu tissue  was party to a loan agreement  dated as of march   with the city of ladysmith  wisconsin 
pursuant to this agreement  the city of ladysmith loaned the proceeds of its variable rate demand solid waste disposal facility revenue bonds  series  or irbs  to cityforest to finance the construction by cityforest of a solid waste disposal facility 
as a result of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we assumed the irbs 
during the third quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of outstanding irbs 
revolving credit facility on november   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility with certain financial institutions 
the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable plus approximately of our eligible inventory  or million 
the term of our revolving credit facility ends on september  as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  but approximately million of the credit facility was being used to support outstanding standby letters of credit 
loans under the credit facility bear interest i for libor loans  libor plus between and  and ii for base rate loans  a per annum rate equal to the greatest of a the prime rate for such day  b the federal funds effective rate for such day  plus  or c libor for a day interest period as determined on such day  plus  plus between and 
the percentage margin on all loans is based on our fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recent four quarters 
as of december   we would have been permitted to draw approximately million under the credit facility at libor plus or base rate plus 
a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is the only financial maintenance covenant under our credit facility and is triggered when there are any commitments or obligations outstanding and availability falls below or an event of default exists  at which time the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio must be at least to as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recent four quarters was to our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by certain of our accounts receivable  inventory and cash 
the terms of the credit facility contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operations of our business by restricting our ability to  among other things  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase capital stock  create  incur or guarantee certain debt  incur liens on certain properties  make capital expenditures  enter into certain affiliate transactions  enter into certain hedging arrangements  and consolidate with or merge with another entity 
the revolving credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants and usual and customary events of default 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  portions of the amounts shown are reflected in our financial statements and accompanying notes  as required by gaap 
see the footnotes following the table for information regarding the amounts presented and for references to relevant financial statement notes that include a detailed discussion of the item 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other obligations  total included above are the principal and interest payments that were due on our and notes  which were outstanding as of december  subsequent to december   we issued the million notes  which mature in a portion of the funds from these notes were used in the redemption of our notes 
for more information regarding specific terms of our long term debt  see the discussion under the heading debt arrangements  and note  debt  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these amounts represent our minimum capital lease payments  including amounts representing interest  and our minimum operating lease payments 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations consist primarily of contracts for the purchase of raw materials primarily pulp from third parties  trade accounts payable as of december   contracts for outside wood chipping  contracts with railroads and contracts with natural gas and electricity providers 
included in other obligations are accrued liabilities and accounts payable other than trade accounts payable as of december   liabilities associated with supplemental pension and deferred compensation arrangements  and estimated payments on qualified pension and postretirement employee benefit plans 
since pension contributions are determined by factors that are subject to change each year  estimated payments on qualified pension plans included above are only for years and are based on current estimates of minimum required contributions 
total excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of timing of payment 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial conditions or consolidated financial statements 
environmental our operating facilities are subject to rigorous federal and state environmental regulation governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management 
our goal is continuous compliance with all environmental regulations and we regularly monitor our activities to ensure compliance with all pertinent rules and requirements 
compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires periodic capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs as rules change 
of our manufacturing sites  two were audited for environmental compliance by outside auditors in no material issues were identified during these audits 
in  we will have eight outside audits conducted 
our goal is that each of our manufacturing facilities will undergo a detailed environmental audit by an outside party at least once every three years 
our tissue manufacturing and converting facility in neenah  wisconsin  received a drafted national pollutant discharge elimination system discharge permit  or npdes  with proposed interim limit on total maximum daily loads  or tmdl 
when the new permit is issued  we expect the initial requirements to be well within the capabilities of the current waste water treatment system  although some upgrades may be required between and no compliance issues are expected and the level of capital upgrades is expected to be minor 
the new federal standard for hazardous air pollutants from boiler and process heaters were finalized by the us environmental protection agency  or epa  in late our sites at lewiston  idaho  menominee  michigan  and cypress bend  arkansas  will be affected by this new rule  although the specific requirements are uncertain at this time 
any capital projects will be executed between and preliminary total cost estimates for all required projects are expected to be between and million 
the epa is also currently reviewing the risks associated with hazardous air pollutants from kraft paper mills 
any changes to these rules would impact our lewiston and cypress bend operations 

table of contents concern over climate change  including the impact of global warming  may lead to future regulations 
we believe there are no us or canadian proposed rules that would have a material impact on our operations 
in we received notification of alleged clean air act violations at our lewiston facility 
we have entered into a tolling agreement and are negotiating with the us department of justice and epa to resolve these alleged violations 
we expect these negotiations to continue through our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that situations that may give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered or that the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations will not require significant expenditures by us 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the results of operations and financial position 
the selection and application of those policies requires management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
as a result  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
see note  recently adopted and prospective accounting standards to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements 
goodwill and intangibles 
our acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance 
in accordance with the accounting guidance  we revalued the assets and liabilities acquired at their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period affecting the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could have a material impact on our earnings 
goodwill from an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
as a result of our cellu tissue acquisition  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   which has not been subsequently adjusted through december  goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and at any time when events suggest impairment may have occurred 
when required  our goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of the consumer products reporting unit to its carrying value 
we incorporate assumptions involving future growth rates  discount rates and tax rates in projecting the future cash flows 
in the event the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
long lived assets 
a significant portion of our total assets are invested in our manufacturing facilities 
also  the cyclical patterns of our businesses cause cash flows to fluctuate by varying degrees from period to period 
as a result  long lived assets are a material component of our financial position with the potential for material change in valuation if assets are determined to be impaired 
accounting guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  as measured by its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
we use our operational budgets to estimate future cash flows 
budgets are inherently uncertain estimates of future performance due to the fact that all inputs  including net sales  costs and capital spending  are subject to frequent change for many different reasons 
because of the number of variables involved  the interrelationship between the variables and the long term nature of the impairment measurement  sensitivity analysis of individual variables is not practical 
budget estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changing business conditions  and operations are reviewed  as appropriate  for impairment using the most current data available 
we believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of all of our long lived assets based on anticipated cash flows that will result from our estimates of future demand  pricing  and production costs  assuming certain levels of capital expenditures 

table of contents pension and postretirement employee benefits 
the determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the rate of return on plan assets 
for other postretirement employee benefit  or opeb  plans  which provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees  critical assumptions in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations 
note  savings  pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements includes information for the three years ended december   and  on the components of pension and opeb expense and the underlying actuarial assumptions used to calculate periodic expense  as well as the funded status for our pension and opeb plans as of december  and the discount rate used in the determination of pension benefit obligations and pension expense is determined based on a review of long term high grade bonds and management s expectations 
at december   we calculated obligations using a discount rate 
the discount rates used at december  and were and  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension assets  we employ a process that analyzes historical long term returns for various investment categories  as measured by appropriate indices 
these indices are weighted based upon the extent to which plan assets are invested in the particular categories in arriving at our determination of a composite expected return 
the long term rates of return used for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
total periodic pension plan expense in was million 
an increase in the discount rate or the rate of expected return on plan assets  all other assumptions remaining the same  would decrease pension plan expense  and conversely  a decrease in either of these measures would increase plan expense 
as an indication of the sensitivity that pension expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumption for expected return on plan assets would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
the actual rates of return on plan assets may vary significantly from the assumptions used because of unanticipated changes in financial markets 
our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded by million at december  and million at december  as a result of being underfunded  we are required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans 
in  we contributed million to these pension plans 
we also contributed million to our non qualified pension plan in our cash contributions in are estimated to be approximately million 
for our opeb plans  expense for was million 
we do not anticipate funding our opeb plans in except to pay benefit costs as incurred during the year by plan participants 
the discount rate used to calculate opeb obligations  which was determined using the same methodology we used for our pension plans  was  and at december   and  respectively 
the assumed health care cost trend rates used to calculate opeb obligations and expense were and  respectively  in  with both grading to over approximately years 
as an indication of the sensitivity that opeb expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect plan expense by approximately million 
a change in the assumption for health care cost trend rates would have affected plan expense by approximately million to million and the total postretirement employee obligation by approximately million to million 
the actual rates of health care cost increases may vary significantly from the assumption used because of unanticipated changes in health care costs 
periodic pension and opeb expenses are included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expense is allocated to all business segments 
in accordance with current accounting guidance governing defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  at december  and  long term assets are recorded for overfunded plans and liabilities are recorded for underfunded plans 
the funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation 
for underfunded plans  the estimated liability to be payable in the next twelve months is recorded as a current liability  with the remaining portion recorded as a long term liability 
effective december   the salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants and after december   it was frozen and ceased accruing further benefits 
in  we recorded a loss of million related to the closing of the salaried pension plan 
in addition  we recorded a million decrease in our pension liability 
income taxes 
the conclusion that deferred tax assets are realizable is subject to certain assessments  projections and judgments made by management 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable  the standard we use is whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry forward periods  projected taxable income  and amounts of taxable income we would have generated historically if we had been a stand alone company in making this 
table of contents assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax asset  we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
based on existing deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these future deductible differences  excluding items for which we have already recorded a valuation allowance 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced 
we have tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the united states and canada and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  management exercises judgment in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to uncertain tax positions which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
while actual results could vary  in management judgment  we have adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our exposure to market risks on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rates applied to borrowings under the credit facility are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
for example  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates  based on assumed outstanding credit facility borrowings of million  would have a million annual effect on interest expense 
we currently do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short term interest rate fluctuations on our credit facility borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments 
commodity risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  which we have  from time to time  partially mitigated through the use of firm price contracts for a portion of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
as of december   we had firm price contracts for natural gas covering approximately of the expected average monthly requirements for foreign currency risk we have minimal foreign currency exchange risk 
virtually all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars
