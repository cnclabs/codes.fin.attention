item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms used in this item and not otherwise defined have the meanings ascribed to such terms under the caption important defined terms used in this form k which immediately precedes part i of this form k 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k and the narrative description of our business contained in item of this form k 
overview state auto financial is a property and casualty insurance holding company 
our insurance subsidiaries are part of the state auto group and pooling arrangement described below 
the state auto group markets its insurance products throughout the united states primarily through independent agencies  which include retail agencies and brokers 
our pooled companies are rated a excellent by am best 
state auto financial s principal subsidiaries are state auto p c  milbank and sa ohio  each of which is a property and casualty insurance company  and stateco  which provides investment management services to affiliated insurance companies 
since january   our reportable insurance segments have been personal insurance  business insurance and specialty insurance 
these insurance segments are aligned with the reporting lines to our principal operating decision makers 
investment operations is also a reportable segment 
as of january   our units within the specialty insurance segment will change from red  rockhill and workers compensation to property  casualty  workers compensation and programs 
see personal and business insurance and specialty insurance in item of this form k for more information about our insurance segments 
we evaluate the performance of our insurance segments using industry financial measurements determined under sap and certain measures determined under gaap 
we evaluate our investment operations segment based on investment returns of assets managed 
financial information about our segments for is set forth in this item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
prior period segment information has been restated to conform to current period presentation 
executive summary to deliver operating and financial results  we focus on our insurance segments personal insurance  business insurance and specialty insurance  along with our investments operations segment 
underlying these segments are performance disciplines that we believe are critical to our success underwriting profitability  risk management and capital management 
underwriting profitability while our goal is to consistently produce an underwriting profit  our combined ratio has exceeded for the last five years 
this result has largely been due to catastrophe and other weather related losses in our property lines of business 
significant efforts are being directed toward returning to prior levels of underwriting profitability 
it is critical that we return our homeowners book of business to underwriting profitability  as it is our second largest line of business after personal auto 
a multi year effort to implement solutions includes an aggressive insurance to value program that audits policy coverage against the actual value of the property 
we have also implemented separate  mandatory wind and hail deductibles for properties in select catastrophe prone states and by peril rating for homeowners in the majority of our states 
by peril rating calculates a separate premium component for each peril and allows us to price more effectively for weather risks  which is the leading cause of homeowners losses 
our claim handling has become more specialized with the addition of dedicated large and small property claim handlers and the formation of a catastrophe claim team  lessening our dependency on independent adjusters 
we re also continuing our efforts to diversify geographically 
finally  we continue to aggressively address our rate needs in homeowners  where we expect to achieve rate adequacy during pricing the property and casualty insurance product has become a sophisticated science 
to that end  we have made significant investment in our actuarial and financial teams  adding depth and talent to these important functions 
we have also enhanced our product management discipline  which uses objective analysis of company results  competitor results and marketplace dynamics to develop  monitor and communicate state strategies 
through product management  we are attempting to capitalize on pricing segmentation  risk selection  portfolio mix and competitive position to optimize profit and growth 
we are dedicated to cost based pricing  with each line of business priced to generate a profit 
we believe changes in our claim organization have positively impacted claims efficiency  improved service and reduced costs 
we have reduced salvage yard vendor fees through negotiation with vendors 
a new auto physical damage unit has significantly reduced independent adjuster expenses and improved claims file administration on auto physical damage claims  while expansion of our house counsel operation not only contributes to lower claim expenses  but improves service 
we believe that our claim performance has been enhanced by our restructuring and business process improvement efforts  and the claim organization will continue to be a significant contributor to improving our ex catastrophe loss and expense ratio performance 
risk management the focus of our enterprise risk management practices are to identify  assess  manage and monitor the frequency and severity of all potential risks 
numerous risks have been identified and are being managed  including a variety of underwriting  operational  market  credit and strategic risks 
all of our business units play important roles in risk identification and in the development and execution of risk management strategies 
catastrophes have been the onerous variable in our profitability formula in recent years 
we are committed to geographic diversity  which means reducing our property risk concentrations in certain geographic regions while at the same time expanding into new states with new relationships 
we believe geographic diversity is a classic but effective way to spread risk and reduce volatility 
we strengthened our risk management capability in through the appointment of a new chief risk officer who reports directly to our ceo 
through this position  we will sharpen our ability to operationalize and integrate risk management capabilities into our capital management  product development  pricing  claims and service capabilities 
capital management our number one goal remains to earn an appropriate risk adjusted return for our shareholders while growing book value 
unprecedented catastrophe losses in  for both us and the insurance industry  impacted our underwriting results and capital levels 
in response  we implemented several actions at the end of to strengthen capital  improve our risk profile and begin restoring book value 
in addition to the ho qs arrangement discussed elsewhere  members of the state auto group pay a portion of the premiums received to reinsurers in exchange for reinsuring a portion of our exposures 
reinsurance reduces our net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
we maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported  based on management s best estimate at a given point in time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is not a precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
our objective is to set reserves that will reasonably approximate the ultimate liability for insured losses and loss expenses 
we regularly review and adjust loss reserves as appropriate 
our investment operations segment maintains a disciplined investment strategy by owning a well diversified portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities and equity securities 
we manage all of our fixed income securities internally 
we manage our us large cap equity portfolio internally and utilize outside managers for our us small cap equities and international equity funds 
we believe that over the long term this diversified portfolio will provide us with the best income and growth possibilities while protecting principal and providing adequate liquidity to support our business operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in this item we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
investments our fixed maturity  equity security and certain other invested asset investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporarily impaired otti  an assessment that requires significant management judgment regarding the evidence known 
such judgments could change in the future as more information becomes known which could negatively impact the amounts reported herein 
we consider the following factors when assessing our equity securities and other invested assets for otti the length of time and or the significance of decline below cost  our ability and intent to hold these securities through their recovery periods  the current financial condition of the issuer and its future business prospects  and the ability of the market value to recover to cost in the near term 
we recognize otti charges on our externally managed small cap equity portfolio and a segment of our large cap portfolio  as we are unable to make the assertion regarding our intent to hold these securities that are currently valued below cost until recovery in the near term 
when an equity security or other invested asset has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income loss 
we also consider the following factors when assessing our fixed maturity investments for otti the financial condition of the issuer including receipt of scheduled principal and interest cash flows  our intent to sell  and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery 
when a fixed maturity has been determined to have an other than temporary impairment  the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings as a realized loss  and the amount related to non credit factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income loss 
deferred acquisition costs as of january   we adopted retrospectively the fasb guidance accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
see new accounting standards adoption of accounting pronouncements accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts included in this item and in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for the impact of this adoption at january  the cumulative effect of this retrospective adoption of this guidance reduced stockholders equity by million  after tax  at january  all applicable prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation 
acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses related to the successful acquisition of acquiring or renewing the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized over the same period in which the related premiums are earned 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premiums to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  that indicate a reduction in expected future profitability may result in unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs 
losses and loss expenses payable our loss reserves reflect all unpaid amounts for claims that have been reported  as well as for ibnr claims 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
loss reserves are management s best estimates mbe at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of that date based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
loss reserves at the individual claim level are established on either a case reserve basis or formula reserve basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on our reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for changes caused by inflation 
case reserves and formula reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
the process for calculating the ibnr component of the loss reserve is to develop an estimate of the ultimate losses and allocated loss expenses incurred  and subtract all amounts already paid or held as case or formula reserves 
the determination of ultimate losses integrates information and analysis provided by several disciplines within our company  including claims  actuarial and accounting 
this assessment requires considerable judgment in understanding how claims mature  which lines of business are the most volatile  and how trends change over time 
loss reserves represent an estimate at a given point in time based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates and economic conditions 
although we consider many different sources of information  as well as a number of actuarial methodologies to estimate our loss reserves  there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
our internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on many of the assumptions underlying each reserving methodology  such as claim frequency  claim severity and loss ratios 
nonetheless  changes which are not contemplated do occur over time  and those changes are incorporated in subsequent valuations of our loss reserves 
we use a number of different methodologies to estimate the ibnr component of our loss reserves 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail lines of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
in general  the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
the reserving methods and strengths and weaknesses of each are described below 
short tail business for short tail business  claims are typically settled within five years  and the most common actuarial estimates are based on techniques using link ratio projections of incurred losses  paid losses  claim counts and claim severities 
each of these methods is described below in detail 
separate projections are made for catastrophes that are in the very early stages of development based on specific information known through the reporting date 
incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is probably the most common actuarial method used in projecting indicated ibnr reserves 
this method uses paid loss experience as well as the outstanding estimates formula and case reserves for claims that have been reported and are still open 
the underlying assumption of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy remains consistent over time 
this method s advantage is its responsiveness to changes in reported losses  which is particularly valuable in the less mature accident years 
the disadvantage of the incurred loss development method is that case reserve adequacy changes will distort the ibnr projections 
paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses calculations that are very similar to the incurred loss development method 
the key difference is that the data used in the paid method exclude case reserve estimates  so only paid losses are utilized 
with this method  a payment pattern is estimated to project ultimate settlement values for each accident year  with the underlying assumption that claims are settled at a consistent rate over time 
neither case reserves nor the rate at which claims are reported except to the extent that the reporting pattern influences the payment pattern is relevant to the results of this method 
this method s advantage is the estimates of ultimate loss are independent of case reserve adequacy and are unaffected by company changes in case reserving philosophy 
the disadvantages are that the paid method does not use all of the available information  and in some cases the liability payment patterns require the application of very large development factors to relatively small payments in less mature accident years 
claim counts and severities method the counts and severities method calculations are very similar to the other methods 
the incurred claim counts reported to date are projected to an ultimate number 
similarly  the incurred loss severities are projected to an ultimate value 
the ultimate incurred count is multiplied by the ultimate incurred severity  for each accident year  to arrive at the ultimate incurred loss 
finally  as with the other loss development methods  an estimate of the ibnr reserve is calculated by subtracting the reported losses from the estimated ultimate losses 
long tail business for long tail business  a material portion of claims may not be settled within five years 
reserve estimates for long tail business use the same methods listed above along with several other methods as determined by the actuary 
for example  premium based methods may be used in developing ultimate loss estimates  including the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson  and least squares techniques as described below 
we may also use statistical models when the historical patterns can be reasonably approximated 
expected loss ratio method the expected loss ratio method generates indicated ibnr by multiplying an expected loss ratio by earned premiums  then subtracting incurred to date losses 
for slower reporting lines of business  new products  or data that is very immature  the actual claim data is often too limited or too volatile for other projection methods 
with this method the premiums are used as a measure of loss exposure  and the loss ratios can be derived from pricing expectations 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a weighted average of the expected loss ratio method and the incurred loss development method  using the percentage of losses reported as the weight 
this method is particularly useful where there is a low volume of data in the current accident period  or where the experience is volatile 
in general  this method produces estimates that are similar to the incurred loss development method 
least square loss development method in the least squares loss development method  the statistical technique of least squares regression is applied to a triangle of reported loss ratios to project the ultimate loss ratio in each accident year 
using historical loss ratios puts the data for each time period on a more consistent exposure basis  because premium levels are generally correlated with insured exposures 
a by product of the regression function is an estimate of credibility for each stage of development 
in cases where the regression parameters fall outside of a reasonable range  the projection defaults to the incurred loss method 
selection process in determining which reserving method to use for a particular line of business or accident year  diagnostic tests of loss ratios and severity trends are considered  as well as the historic case reserve adequacy and claim settlement rate 
in general  the incurred loss development method is used if the projections are stable  the data is credible  historic case reserve adequacy is consistent  and the loss ratios and loss severities are reasonable 
other reserving methods are considered as well for particular lines of business or accident years  along with supplemental information such as open claim counts and prior period development 
for example  if more than one method provides a reasonable projection  the actuary may select an average of those methods 
there is considerable judgment applied in the analysis of the historical patterns and in applying business knowledge of our underwriting and claims functions 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the loss reserve projections 
the primary determinant in estimating the loss reserve range boundaries are the variances measured within the historical reserving data for the various lines of business 
mbe of loss reserves considers the expected variation to establish an appropriate position within a range 
mbe loss and alae reserves for the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies reserves at december   was million  within an estimated range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the inter company pooling arrangement 
therefore  these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
the potential impact of the loss reserve variability on net income can be illustrated using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach a level corresponding to the high point of the range  million  the reserve increase of million corresponds to an after tax decrease of million in net income  assuming a tax rate of 
likewise  should ultimate losses decline to a level corresponding to the low point of the range  million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
the loss reserve range noted above represents a range of reasonably likely reserves  not a range of all possible reserves 
therefore  the ultimate losses could reach levels corresponding to reserve amounts outside the range provided 
an important assumption underlying the loss reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other product liability loss and alae reserve to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary increase could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other product liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million reduction to net income  assuming a tax rate of 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other product liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 
in addition to establishing loss reserves  as described above  we establish reserves for ulae 
historical patterns of paid ulae relative to paid loss are analyzed along with historical claim counts including claims opened  claims closed  and claims remaining open 
the product of this analysis is an estimate of the relationship  or ratio  between ulae and loss underlying the current loss reserves 
this ratio is applied to the current outstanding loss reserves to estimate the required ulae reserve 
consequently  this component of the loss expense reserve has a proportional relationship to the overall claim inventory and held loss reserves 
the method assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change materially over time 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of mbe of our direct loss and alae reserve to our net loss and loss expenses payable at december  and the stfc pooled companies net additional share of transactions assumed from state auto mutual through the pooling arrangement for the years ended december  and  respectively  has been reflected in the table below as assumed by stfc pooled companies

because we have insured primarily product retailers and distributors  we do not expect to incur the same level of liability  particularly related to asbestos  as companies that have insured manufacturing risks 
asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net losses and loss expenses payable 
asbestos reserves increased million and environmental reserves decreased million from pension and postretirement benefit obligations pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management s judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
we review these factors annually  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because these obligations are based on estimates which could change  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
the state auto group has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired prior to january  and a postretirement healthcare plan covering certain associates and retirees collectively the benefit plans 
several factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the benefit plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining benefit obligations may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
to calculate the state auto group s december  benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans  we used a discount rate of based on an evaluation of the expected future benefit cash flows of our benefit plans used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve at the measurement date 
a lower discount rate results in  all else being equal  a higher present value of the benefit obligation 
to calculate our benefit obligation at december  and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december   a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used 
we selected an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by considering the mix of investments and stability of investment portfolio along with actual investment experience during the lifetime of the plans 
our assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets could have a significant effect on the amounts related to our benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost depending on the degree of change between reporting periods 
the following table sets forth an illustration of variability with respect to the discount rate on our share of the state auto group s december  benefit obligation and expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december   along with the variability of the expected return on plan assets to our expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december  holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in any one of our key assumptions are as follows millions pension postretirement discount rate discount rate benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost benefit expected return on plan assets expected return on plan assets net periodic benefit cost benefit the accumulated benefit obligation abo of a defined benefit pension plan represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to the measurement date and based on current and past compensation levels  while the projected benefit obligation pbo is the abo plus a factor for future compensation levels 
the abo  which considers current compensation levels only  provides information about the obligation an employer would have if the plan were discontinued at the measurement date 
at december   our share of the state auto group s abo and pbo was million and million  respectively 
at december   stfc s share of the defined benefit pension plan s fair value of the assets was million  which resulted in an underfunded status within our balance sheet of million 
on a cash flow basis  we target an annual contribution level that meets at least the targeted normal cost plus any shortfall amortizations of the plan  as defined by erisa 
currently  we expect to make a cash contribution to the pension plan up to million in the unfunded status on the pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan increased from million at december   to million at december  primarily influencing this increase are actuarial gains and losses arising from factors that include a decrease in the discount rate and expected to actual demographic changes  such as retirement age  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation changes

deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effect of the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in accordance with the fasb s asc income taxes topic asc  we periodically evaluate our deferred tax assets  which requires significant judgment  to determine if they are realizable based upon weighing all available evidence  both positive and negative  including loss carryback potential  past operating results  existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  projected performance of the business  future taxable income  including the ability to generate capital gains  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
during  we experienced a net loss driven by the magnitude of record level catastrophe storm losses in the second quarter which significantly exceeded our projections 
we considered both positive and negative evidence and concluded a valuation allowance should be established 
at december  and  we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the deferred income tax asset remaining after recognition of the valuation allowance represents a deferred tax asset on the gross unrealized fixed maturity losses where we have concluded this portion of the asset to be realizable due to our assertion that we have both the ability and intent to hold these securities through recovery or maturity 
the following table sets forth the components of our federal income tax expense for the years ended december  and millions as adjusted income loss before federal income taxes current tax benefit deferred tax benefit federal income tax benefit prior to valuation allowance valuation allowance total federal income tax benefit expense net income loss in future periods we will re assess our judgments and assumptions regarding the realization of our net deferred tax assets  but until such time as the positive evidence exceeds the negative evidence we will maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
until that time  as we report net earnings and generate taxable income  we do not expect our consolidated statements of income to reflect any federal income tax expense as we utilize our net operating loss carryforward and release a corresponding amount of the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance  unless we are in an exception position as described by the intraperiod allocation guidance included in asc asc requires all sources of other income  including other comprehensive income  to be considered when there is an expected loss from continuing operations for purposes of determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations when assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
alternatively  any reported losses will add to our net operating loss carryforward position and be reserved against by adding to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
based on asc intraperiod tax allocation guidelines  the following sets forth the change in valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations and other comprehensive income for the years ended december  and millions for the year ended december for the year ended december continuing operations other comprehensive income change in valuation allowance see note  federal income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further disclosures regarding our income tax matters

actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
pooling arrangement the stfc pooled companies and the mutual pooled companies participate in a quota share reinsurance pooling arrangement referred to as the pooling arrangement 
under the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual assumes premiums  losses and expenses from each of the pooled companies and in turn cedes to each of the pooled companies a specified portion of premiums  losses and expenses based on each of the pooled companies respective pooling percentages 
state auto mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
in  we made two changes to the pooling arrangement 
first  as of january   we added the rockhill insurers to the pool each with a participation percentage of the pool change 
in conjunction with the pool change  the stfc pooled companies received million million in cash and million in investment securities from the rockhill insurers for net insurance liabilities transferred on january  the following table sets forth the impact on our balance sheet at january  millions increase decrease losses and loss expenses payable unearned premiums other liabilities less deferred acquisition costs net cash and investment securities received second  at the close of business on december   the pooling arrangement was amended to reduce the overall participation percentage of the stfc pooled companies from to and to include the pooling of applicable balance sheet accounts such as accumulated other comprehensive income related to employee benefit plans the

in conjunction with the 
pool change  the stfc pooled companies paid million in cash to the mutual pooled companies subsequent to year end for net liabilities transferred on december  the following table sets forth the impact on our balance sheet at december  millions decrease increase losses and loss expenses payable unearned premiums pension and postretirement liabilities other liabilities accumulated other comprehensive income less deferred acquisition costs other assets net cash paid in  we made the following changes to the pooling arrangement the pool changes added sa national to the pool with a participation percentage of  and included voluntary assumed reinsurance from third parties unaffiliated with the pooled companies that was assumed on or after january  by state auto mutual 
state auto financial sold its nonstandard automobile insurance subsidiary  sa national  to a third party on december  concurrent with this sale  sa national s participation in the pooling arrangement was terminated  and we entered into a loss portfolio transfer and a quota share reinsurance agreement on december  to assume liability for the pre and post closing book of business of sa national  including providing policy and claims service to sa national policyholders  until policies are renewed with the third party purchaser on such purchaser s systems during a transition period of up to six months following effective date of sale 
the transition was completed as of june  however  we continued to service policies that were written by us through june  the business assumed by us is subject to the pooling arrangement 
the following table sets forth the participants and their participation percentages in the pooling arrangement january  december  january  december  close of business december  december  stfc pooled companies state auto p c milbank sa ohio sa national n a n a n a total stfc pooled companies state auto mutual pooled companies state auto mutual sa wisconsin meridian security meridian citizens mutual patrons mutual litchfield ric n a plaza n a american compensation n a bloomington compensation n a total state auto mutual pooled companies includes the pooling participation percentage of farmers which was merged into state auto p c as of the close of business on december  farmers pooling participation percentage was from january  to december  includes the pooling participation percentages of sa florida and beacon national  each of which was merged into meridian security as of the close of business on december  each of sa florida s and beacon national s pooling participation percentage was from january  to december  we anticipate that the stfc pooled companies will maintain a participation percentage in the pooling arrangement for the foreseeable future 
however  under applicable governance procedures  if the pooling arrangement were to be amended  management would make recommendations to the independent committees of the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc 
the independent committees review and evaluate such factors as they deem relevant and recommend any appropriate pooling change to the board of directors of both state auto mutual and stfc subject to regulatory approval by each participant s respective domiciliary insurance department 
the pooling arrangement is terminable by any of our pooled companies at any time by any party by giving twelve months notice to the other parties and their respective domiciliary insurance departments 
none of our pooled companies currently intends to terminate the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  all subject premiums  incurred losses  loss expenses and other underwriting expenses are prorated among our pooled companies on the basis of their participation in the pool 
by spreading the underwriting risk  the pooling arrangement is designed to produce more uniform and stable underwriting results for each of our pooled companies than any one company would experience individually 
this has the effect of providing each of our pooled companies with a similar mix of pooled property and casualty insurance business on a net basis

as previously reported  we adopted with retrospective application at january  accounting standards update  accounting for costs associated with acquiring and renewing insurance contracts  all applicable prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation 
see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs included in item of this form k 
summary our net income was million compared to a net loss of million in and net income of million in our net loss included a non cash charge of million related to a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our revenues were  million compared to revenues of  million in and  million in our expenses were  compared to expenses of  million in and  million in the decline in revenues from to is attributed to the ho qs arrangement discussed below and the 
pool change discussed above 
the following highlights significant factors that impacted results as compared to and earned premiums in were  million compared to  million and  million in and  respectively 
the ho qs arrangement accounted for million and the 
pool change contributed million of this decline 
excluding the impact of the ho qs arrangement and 
pool change  earned premium increased 
this growth was driven by our business insurance and specialty segments 
the business segment growth was principally driven by higher average new business premium  increased renewal pricing and a recovering economy 
also contributing to this growth was our termination of an umbrella quota share reinsurance arrangement as of july  the specialty segment growth was principally driven by the addition of new programs and increased rates in our rockhill unit 
our results reflected a significant decrease in weather related catastrophe losses when compared to the same and results 
our catastrophe loss ratio was loss ratio points compared to loss ratio points and loss ratio points for and  respectively 
the ho qs arrangement benefitted the ratio by ceding catastrophe losses to our reinsurance partners 
the results of our personal and business insurance segments reflected a record level of weather related catastrophe losses  which impacted of our operating states  including hurricane irene and devastating tornadoes in tuscaloosa  alabama and joplin  missouri 
our sap non catastrophe loss and alae ratio for was loss ratio points compared to loss ratio points and loss ratio points for the same and periods  respectively 
our non catastrophe loss and alae ratio results were negatively impacted by the strengthening of loss reserves in our red unit within our specialty insurance segment 
the ho qs arrangement increased our sap non catastrophe loss and alae ratio points in our non catastrophe loss and alae ratio results were also negatively impacted by a higher level of non catastrophe weather related losses  a higher number of large bodily injury claims and an increase in workers compensation reserves on certain life time disability claims 
net realized gains on investments were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the level of realized gains in was driven by reducing our equity holdings to manage our risk parameters as well as selling select securities in anticipation of the cash transfers in connection with the 
pool change and the ho qs arrangement 
for the year ended december   the following table sets forth the reconciliation of as reported earned premiums to pro forma earned premiums that exclude the impact of the quota share reinsurance agreement covering our homeowners book of business 
for the year ended december   the following table sets forth the reconciliation on a pro forma basis which assumes that the 
pool change from to was in effect as of january  in millions for the year ended december change earned premiums as reported earned premiums ho qs arrangement sub total excluding ho qs impact of 
pool change pro forma earned premiums insurance segments insurance industry regulators require our insurance subsidiaries to report their financial condition and results of operations using sap 
we use sap financial results  along with industry standard financial measures determined on a sap basis and certain measures determined on a gaap basis  to internally monitor the performance of our insurance segments and reward our employees 
one of the more significant differences between gaap and sap is that sap requires all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the periods the related written premiums are earned 
for a discussion of deferred acquisition costs  see critical accounting policies deferred acquisition costs section included in this item all references to financial measures or components thereof in this discussion are calculated on a gaap basis  unless otherwise noted 
use of non gaap financial measures in the following discussion of the results of our insurance segments  we sometimes refer to gaap financial measures in the context of as reported and to non gaap financial measures in the context of pro forma 
these pro forma  or non gaap financial measures  may i exclude the impact of the ho qs arrangement cession for the year ended december   ii exclude the one time impact of the pool change for the year ended december   iii exclude the impact of the pool changes  iv assumes the 
pool change from an to participation percentage had been in effect as of january   and v exclude the impact of the red underwriting results 
we believe the use of these non gaap financial measures will enable investors to a better understand the significance the reinsurance arrangement cession is contributing to our reported results for the year ended december   and b perform a meaningful comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  and we have also included reconciliation tables and tables for readers to better understand the use and calculation of these non gaap financial measures 
homeowners quota share arrangement to reduce risk and volatility  while providing us with additional catastrophe reinsurance protection  the state auto group entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement on december  with a syndicate of unaffiliated reinsurers covering its homeowners book of business the ho qs arrangement 
under the ho qs arrangement  the state auto group ceded to the reinsurers of its homeowners business under policies in force at december  and new and renewal policies thereafter issued during the term of the agreement 
the ho qs arrangement is in effect until december  see liquidity and capital resources reinsurance arrangements for a more detailed discussion of the ho qs arrangement 
we believe the long term benefits of our homeowner actions will be a more predictable and profitable book of homeowners business with reduced risk to our capital base 
for  our gaap and sap underwriting loss was million and million  respectively 
the ho qs arrangement improved our gaap net underwriting loss by million or points increase on our gaap combined ratio see reconciliation table  and our sap underwriting loss by million or points increase on our sap combined ratio see reconciliation table

revenue we measure our top line growth for our insurance segments based on net written premiums  which provide us with an indication of how well we are doing in terms of revenue growth before it is actually earned 
our policies provide a fixed amount of coverage for a stated period of time  often referred to as the policy term 
as such  our written premiums are recognized as earned ratably over the policy term 
the unearned portion of written premiums  called unearned premiums  is reflected on our balance sheet as a liability and represents our obligation to provide coverage for the unexpired term of the policies

this decrease in premiums was primarily due to the following changes in our personal auto and homeowners lines of business i the reshaping of our geographic footprint  ii rate actions  and iii the ho qs arrangement 
in our personal insurance segment  the ho qs arrangement decreased our sap net underwriting loss by million and our sap combined ratio by points for the year ended december  see reconciliation table

cessions under the ho qs arrangement reduced our personal insurance segment catastrophe losses by million in see reconciliation table 
in  our catastrophe losses without the ho qs cession was million 
the majority of the catastrophe losses were primarily related to wind and hail activity from a tornado  wind and hail activity in louisville  kentucky  and st 
louis  missouri and wind activity from a storm in the midwest and mid atlantic states 
in  our catastrophe losses included losses arising from hurricane irene and the tornadoes in tuscaloosa  alabama and joplin  missouri  as well as other tornadoes and wind and hail storms 
a majority of the losses generated from these catastrophes were concentrated in six states tennessee  ohio  missouri  texas  north carolina and alabama 
the severity of these storm losses was the highest in our history 
during  we were impacted by losses from of the storms that were classified as numbered catastrophes by pcs  including a series of spring storms with wind and hail in northern ohio and a rash of floods in the nashville  tennessee area  both which affected our auto physical damage results in both personal and business insurance auto lines 
as reported personal auto net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to as reported net written premiums for the same period see reconciliation table 
as reported personal auto net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to pro forma net written premiums for the same period see table 
this decrease in premiums was primarily due to i the reshaping of our geographic footprint to de emphasize the midwest and southeast and to grow in areas less prone to wind damage  and ii actions taken in our homeowners book of business discussed below which have impacted our companion home auto policies 
even with this decline in overall personal auto net written premiums  we have continued to achieve premium growth in several states such as texas  colorado  connecticut and georgia 
in addition  we have produced personal auto premium growth in underpenetrated states  such as illinois and michigan 
we continue to aggressively address our rate needs in the personal auto line of business and have filed rate increases in the mid single digit range to offset loss cost trends  primarily relating to bodily injury claims 
the personal auto sap non cat loss ratio for the year ended december  improved slightly compared to this ratio for the same period primarily due to the factors discussed above 
as reported personal auto net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to as reported net written premiums for the same period see reconciliation tables and 
pro forma personal auto net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to pro forma net written premiums for the same period see table 
this decrease in premiums was primarily impacted by the sale of our nonstandard automobile insurance subsidiary in the personal auto sap non cat loss ratio for the year ended december  increased points compared to this ratio for the same period 
the increase in this ratio was primarily due to increases in liability claim frequency  including an increase in the number of large losses 
as reported homeowners net written premiums was million for the year ended december  compared to as reported net written premiums of million for the same period see reconciliation table 
as reported homeowners net written premiums decreased million for the year ended december  compared to pro forma net written premiums for the same period see table 
this decrease in premiums was primarily due to the ho qs arrangement

at december  under the ho qs arrangement  the state auto group ceded of its unearned premiums million pro forma in force to the reinsurers  which impacted our net written premiums by the same amount 
as reported homeowners net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to as reported net written premiums for the same period see reconciliation tables and 
pro forma homeowners net written premiums for the year ended december  decreased compared to pro forma net written premiums for the same period see table 
this decrease in premiums was primarily due to the ho qs arrangement 
during and  we experienced declines in our policy counts from our core states of ohio  kentucky  and indiana but also experienced policy count growth in states that we have either expanded into or identified as profitable growth opportunities

in addition  we experienced improvement due to favorable development from events that occurred prior to the inception of the ho qs arrangement 
events occurring on or prior to december  are excluded from the ho qs arrangement 
the homeowners sap non cat loss ratio for the year ended december  was  an improvement of points compared to the same period see table 
our non catastrophe loss ratio improved as a result of prior year rate actions emerging in earned premiums 
we continued to aggressively address our rate needs in the homeowners book of business in receiving regulatory approval to implement rate increases averaging approximately in of of the states we write homeowners business in active states during in general  the most wind and adverse weather prone states are receiving higher rate and deductible increases 
the homeowners sap non cat loss ratio for the year ended december  slightly declined points from the same period see table 
in addition to rate increases  we continue to utilize the following additional strategies to improve our homeowners results 
customfit sm homeowners we have implemented the use of our by peril rating approach  customfit homeowners  in states that represent approximately of our homeowners premium and of our five year wind hail losses 
during  our customfit homeowners was operational in of our active states 
during  we developed a second generation customfit homeowners product  which enhances our ability to model non weather related losses 
this second generation of customfit homeowners was deployed in active states in late evaluating  monitoring and terminating unprofitable agencies we are aggressively evaluating and monitoring unprofitable agencies  which includes reviewing existing policies  implementing tighter new business and renewal guidelines  and applying other loss mitigation tools 
in  we terminated the personal lines relationship with a significant number of agencies in our most unprofitable homeowners states 
insurance to value we continue to focus on insurance to value so that our insureds maintain an amount of coverage sufficient to replace their home and contents in the case of a total loss 
proper insurance to value ensures that our premiums are commensurate with our loss exposure 
wind and hail deductibles we have implemented mandatory wind and hail deductibles in all targeted catastrophe prone states 
we continue to evaluate the implementation of this loss mitigation tool in other states based upon annual rate reviews

this increase in premiums was primarily due to our i writing larger average premium new business accounts  ii receiving modest pricing increases on renewal business  and iii experiencing more growth on existing polices due to improved economic conditions 
additionally  business insurance segment net written premiums included million of unearned premiums transferred as the result of terminating an umbrella quota share reinsurance arrangement as of july  for the year ended december   written premiums of million were ceded under the umbrella treaty

the business insurance segment s sap non catastrophe loss and alae ratio for was loss ratio points compared to loss ratio points and loss ratio points for and  respectively see table 
the decrease from to was primarily due to fewer large losses in our fire and allied and other product liability lines 
the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in weather related losses in the fire allied lines as well as an increase in the number of large losses attributable to a more active claims process whereby the ultimate liability was recognized earlier in the case reserving process 
the business insurance segment s catastrophe loss and alae ratio for was loss ratio points compared to loss ratio points and loss ratio points for and  respectively 
we experienced a higher level of catastrophe losses in and as compared to our small accounts are a foundational element of our premium writings and will continue as an important part of our future business plans 
improved efficiency and reduced processing expense will be critical to our success managing these accounts 
business insurance evolution bie  introduced into two states in  is an important tool providing automated predictive price models and rules engines as part of our new business and policy renewal process on our smaller accounts 
bie will allow this process to move from being high touch ie very manual  to low or in many instances no touch processing 
we intend to complete the integration of bie into our remaining states in in our largest lines of business 
we believe that over time the ability to price policies based on predictive criteria and issuing them more efficiently will produce an improvement in our loss ratio and expense ratio results  while increasing agent satisfaction 
we anticipate profit improvement in our smaller account book of business beginning in our current book of business is mainly comprised of smaller commercial accounts that are less than  in premium 
our goal in is to write larger  more complex accounts in the premium range of  as these accounts are written frequently by independent agents  we have developed strategies which we believe will enable us to write a larger percentage of these accounts 
we believe writing a greater mix of larger accounts will improve our expense ratio and provide value to our independent agencies 
additionally  we are concentrating on accounts which produce  or more in premium 
these large accounts will typically have over million of payroll and more than million in sales 
we believe our risk consulting and claims management will provide value to our independent agents in writing these larger accounts 
specialty insurance segment in our specialty insurance segment  we offer commercial coverages that require specialized product underwriting  claims handling or risk management services through a distribution channel of retail agents and wholesale brokers  which may include program administrators and other specialty sources

the increase was impacted by the following 
growth driven by the addition of six new programs generated through managing general underwriters 
these new programs accounted for million of the premium growth for the year ended december   changes in the structure of two liability lines and all other perils reinsurance programs made in  which resulted in our retaining additional written premium of million for the year ended december   significant rate increases in our property business and increased business opportunities through our excess and surplus channel for catastrophe exposed businesses due to recent global catastrophe events and recent industry catastrophe model changes 
this business is written on a non admitted basis  which allows us to underwrite unique insurance requirements using customized rates and forms  and is subject to a separate catastrophe treaty with a net retention of million for each occurrence  and exposure growth in our excess and surplus casualty lines  which we believe was attributable to early signs of stabilization in pricing in the commercial lines market and the strengthening of broker relationships and marketing initiatives 
for our rockhill unit  as reported net written premiums for the year ended december  increased million compared to as reported net written premiums for the same period see reconciliation tables and

several factors are considered by us when estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure changes  anticipated inflation  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  late reported claims  and other reasonableness tests 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in our estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
acquisition and operating expenses our gaap expense ratio was in compared to and in and  respectively 
investment operations segment our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other members of the state auto group are managed by our subsidiary  stateco 
stateco utilizes its own personnel to invest in fixed maturities and large cap equities and outside investment managers to invest in small cap equities and international funds 
the investment committee the committee of our board of directors establishes the investment policies to be followed by stateco 
our primary investment objectives are to maintain adequate liquidity and capital to meet our responsibilities to policyholders  grow long term economic surplus to increase our capital position  maintain a consistent level of income to support operations and manage investment risk 
our current investment strategy does not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e our liquidity requirements at any given time  and f our current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed maturity investments 
we have investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed maturity investments for our insurance subsidiaries which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
for the insurance subsidiaries  the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to or less of statutory assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
our fixed maturity portfolio is composed of high quality  investment grade issues  comprised almost entirely of debt issues rated aaa or aa 
at december   there were no fixed maturity investments rated below investment grade in our available for sale investment portfolio 
our internally managed equity portfolio invests in us large cap  dividend paying companies across many different industries selected based upon their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends 
this diversification across companies and industries reduces volatility in the value of the large cap equity portfolio 
in addition  our investment policy guidelines limit the purchase of a specific stock to no more than of the market value of the stock at the time of purchase  and no single equity holding should exceed of the total equity portfolio 
our externally managed equity portfolios invest in us small cap equities and international funds 
these managers are permitted to manage the portfolios according to their own respective portfolio objectives 
in selecting our outside investment managers we confirm that their portfolio objectives  including risk tolerance  are acceptable to us 
however  there may be slight differences in their objectives with respect to dividend payments and other constraints that we apply to our large cap equity holdings 
diversifying our portfolio into small cap equities and international equity funds was designed to achieve a greater total return with reduced volatility 
we believe that in most market cycles  diversification of the portfolio will be beneficial to us  and we plan to continue to maintain a diversified portfolio 
at december   our investments in fixed maturities  equity securities and certain other invested assets were held as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss and as such are not included in the determination of net income loss

under these credit agreements  state auto mutual borrowed a total of million from us on an unsecured basis

at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value  and the top ten positions accounted for of the equity portfolio 
at december   our equity portfolio consisted of approximately different large cap stocks and small cap stocks 
the largest single position was of the equity portfolio based on fair value and the top ten positions account for of the equity portfolio 
since our equity portfolio consists primarily of large cap value oriented stocks  with a small allocation to small cap equities  when large cap stocks and or value oriented stocks perform well our equity portfolio typically performs well compared to benchmarks 
conversely  when growth stocks outperform value and or small to mid cap stocks outperform large cap stocks  our equity portfolio does not perform as well compared to benchmarks 
market risk our primary market risk exposures are to changes in market prices for equity securities and changes in interest rates and credit ratings for fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk whereby the value of the securities varies as market interest rates change 
we manage this risk by closely monitoring the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our interest rate risk and the effects of a parallel change in interest rates on the fair value of the available for sale fixed maturity portfolio at december  millions fair value bps change bps change actual bps change bps change fixed maturities us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities us government agencies residential mortgage backed securities balance as of december  this table summarizes only the effects that a parallel change in interest rates could have on the fixed maturity portfolio 
changes in rates would also change the value of our liabilities and possibly other financial assets 
we caution the reader that this analysis does not take into account nonparallel changes in interest rates 
it is likely that some rates would increase or decrease more than others depending upon market conditions at the time of the change 
this nonparallel change would alter the value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the analysis is also limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in interest rates and the resulting fixed maturity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
we believe that the fixed maturity portfolio s exposure to credit risk is minimal as approximately of the bonds we own are rated aa or better 
we do not intend to change our investment policy on the quality of our fixed maturity investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio is managed in a laddered maturity style and considers business mix and liability payout patterns to ensure adequate cash flow to meet claims as they are presented 
we also manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances  owning some agency and us treasury securities at all times  purchasing bonds of major issuers  and purchasing bonds that are part of a medium or large issue 
the fixed maturity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to either exchange rate risk or commodity risk 
we do not rely on the use of derivative financial instruments 
to provide us greater flexibility in order to manage our market risk exposures  we categorize our fixed maturities as available for sale 
we do not maintain a trading portfolio 
we have no mortgage backed securities in our fixed maturity portfolio which may be labeled sub prime mortgage backed securities 
we invest only in conventional mortgage backed securities issued by a federal agency or that are us government guaranteed 
specifically  approximately million or of our fixed maturity available for sale investment portfolio as of december   were in either ginnie mae pools  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  or fannie mae or freddie mac pools 
in  both fannie mae and freddie mac received additional us government backing when they were placed into conservatorship 
our fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included obligations of states and political subdivisions with a total carrying value of million  with million of these securities  or of our municipal securities portfolio muni portfolio  enhanced by third party monoline insurers a credit enhancement for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
a credit enhancement is not a primary consideration to us when purchasing a municipal security  as we consider the underlying credit quality of the security as the primary rating factor in our evaluation process 
of the total million of municipal securities in our investment portfolio at december   were rated aa or better  without the benefit of a credit enhancement 
we do not believe that a loss of a credit enhancement would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities 
in addition  as of december   we had no direct investment in any guarantor including any bond insurer 
the following table sets forth the credit ratings of our municipal securities  excluding credit enhancements  based on ratings by nationally recognized rating agencies at december  rating millions total fair value aaa aa a other total our aaa rating category includes securities which have been either pre funded or escrowed to maturity

formerly fsa aaa aa a ambac aaa aa a fgic aaa aa national public finance guarantee formerly mbia aaa aa a xlca a total municipal securities enhanced by third party monoline insurers we believe our muni portfolio is well diversified by issuer and state 
we have invested in securities which have been either pre refunded or escrowed to maturity bonds 
within the non pre refunded and escrowed to maturity portfolio  no single issuer comprises more than of the portfolio and no more than of the portfolio is concentrated in any one state 
we believe our muni portfolio is invested within the strongest sectors of the municipal bond market 
of our municipal bonds are general obligation bonds or other tax backed bonds 
the majority of the remaining muni portfolio consists of revenue bonds 
our credit research is an important part of our investment management process  and we continually monitor all holdings for any signs of deterioration 
we believe that our municipal holdings will maintain their high credit quality and that the issuers will be able to make all principal and interest payments as they come due 
during and  we experienced a high level of call activity with respect to both our tax exempt and taxable bonds due to the low interest rate environment 
the proceeds from the call  maturity or sale of securities within our muni portfolio have been reinvested into both tax exempt and taxable fixed income securities with lower rates of return 
as of december   our large cap equity portfolio had a beta of using the s p index as a benchmark 
beta estimates the degree the portfolio s price will fluctuate based on a given movement in the market index 
the following table sets forth what changes might occur in the value of the large cap equity portfolio given a change in the s p index at december  fair value millions change in s p index value as of original value the above analysis is limited in that it does not take into account any actions that might be taken by us in response to these changes 
as a result  the actual impact of a change in equity market prices and the resulting equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the table 
by investing in mostly large cap issues we hope to limit liquidity risk in the equity portfolio 
the large cap equity portfolio does not have any direct exposure to exchange rate risk since we do not directly hold any foreign stocks 
we constantly monitor the equity portfolio holdings for any credit risk issues that may arise 
we do not invest in any commodity futures or commodity oriented mutual funds 
at december   we have two international funds  fund and fund  which are included in other invested assets available for sale 
fund and fund had betas of and  respectively  using the msci eafe index as a benchmark 
beta estimates the degree the portfolio s price will fluctuate based on a given movement in the index

as a result  the actual impact of a change in international equity market prices and the resulting international equity values may differ significantly from what is shown in the tables above

a cash outflow of million related to the settlement of the 
pool change and the initial transfer of unearned premium related to the ho qs arrangement 
interest earned on our fixed maturity securities declined primarily due to lower yields 
as our higher yielding bonds mature or are called by the issuers  the proceeds are being reinvested at a lower interest rate 
the amortized cost value of our treasury inflation protected securities tips was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the same and periods 
the income earned on our tips securities  which is dependent on changes in the cpi index  decreased by million when compared to the same period and increased by million in when compared to the same period 
during and  we sold several of our equity securities for several reasons  including managing our equity holdings to be consistent with our investment policy  responding to negative outlooks  achieving our price targets  as well as to accumulate cash to be in a position to settle the transfers related to the 
pool change with the mutual pooled companies in early in  to offset the decline in interest earned on our fixed maturity securities and to improve yield and cash flows  we began to hold additional high dividend paying equities

pool change ii the achievement of our price target  iii in response to negative outlook announcements or changes in business conditions which in our opinion diminished the future business prospects of certain securities and iv in order to manage our equity holdings to be consistent with our investment policy 
when a fixed maturity security has been determined to have an other than temporary decline in fair value  the impairment charge is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to non credit factors  which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
see critical accounting policies investments included in this item for otti impairment indicators 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we recognized otti on our fixed maturity portfolio during of million and did not recognize any impairments on our fixed maturity portfolio during and when an equity security or other invested asset has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  we adjust the cost basis of the security to fair value 
see critical accounting policies investments included in this item for otti impairment indicators 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not reversed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the following table sets forth the realized losses related to otti on our investment portfolio recognized for the year ended december  millions number of positions total impairment equity securities small cap securities bonds total otti gross unrealized investment gains and losses based upon our review of our investment portfolio at december   we determined that there were no individual investments with an unrealized holding loss that had a fair value significantly below cost continually for more than one year

we obtain one price per security  and our processes and control procedures are designed to ensure the value is accurately recorded on an unadjusted basis 
through discussions with the pricing service  we gain an understanding of the methodologies used to price the different types of securities  that the data and the valuation methods utilized are appropriate and consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and representative of fair value 
to validate the reasonableness of the valuations obtained from the pricing service  we compare to other fair value pricing information gathered from other independent pricing sources 
see note  fair value of financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a presentation of our available for sale investments within the fair value hierarchy at december  as of december   level assets as a percentage of total assets were  which we have determined to be insignificant 
other items income taxes for the year ended december   federal income tax benefit was million compared to tax expense of million and less than million for the same and periods  respectively 
the effective tax rate for of differs from the statutory rate of principally because of the valuation allowance that was established during a valuation allowance of million was held at december   with a corresponding charge to total tax expense for the year ended december  see critical accounting policies deferred income taxes included in this item see note  federal income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a reconciliation between our actual federal income tax expense benefit and the amount computed at the indicated statutory rate for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources general liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our short and long term needs 
our primary sources of cash are premiums  investment income  investment sales and the maturity of fixed income security investments 
the significant outflows of cash are payments of claims  commissions  premium taxes  operating expenses  income taxes  dividends  interest and principal payments on debt and investment purchases 
the cash outflows may vary due to uncertainties regarding settlement of large losses or catastrophe events 
as a result  we continually monitor our investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
liquidity our insurance subsidiaries must have adequate liquidity to ensure that their cash obligations are met 
however  the stfc pooled companies do not have the daily liquidity concerns normally associated with an insurance company due to their participation in  and the terms of  the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  state auto mutual receives all premiums and pays all losses and expenses associated with the insurance business produced by the stfc pooled companies and the other pool participants  and then it settles the intercompany balances generated by these transactions with the pool participants within days following each quarter end 
we believe this provides state auto mutual with sufficient liquidity to pay losses and expenses of our insurance operations on a timely basis 
when settling the intercompany balances  state auto mutual provides the pool participants with full credit for the premiums written net of losses paid during the quarter  retaining all receivable amounts from insureds and agents and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses from unaffiliated reinsurers 
any receivable amounts that are ultimately deemed to be uncollectible are charged off by state auto mutual and allocated to the pool participant on the basis of its pooling percentage 
as a result  we have an off balance sheet credit risk related to the balances due to state auto mutual from insureds  agents and reinsurers  which are offset by the unearned premiums from the respective policies 
while the total amount due to state auto mutual from policyholders and agents is significant  the individual amounts due are relatively small at the policyholder and agency level 
based on historical data  this credit risk exposure is not considered to be material to our financial position  though the impact to income on a quarterly basis may be material 
the state auto group mitigates its exposure to this credit risk through its in house collections unit for both personal and commercial accounts which is supplemented by third party collection service providers 
the amounts deemed uncollectible by state auto mutual and allocated to the stfc pooled companies are included in the other expenses line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we generally manage our cash flows through current operational activity and maturing investments  without a need to liquidate any of our other investments 
however  should our written premiums decline or paid losses increase significantly  or a combination thereof  our cash flows from operations could be impacted requiring us to liquidate investments at losses 
this action was not necessary in  or  despite the increased level of catastrophe losses 
we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid investments to ensure the immediate availability of funds to pay claims and expenses 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  and  million and  million  respectively  of total available for sale investments 
included in our fixed maturities available for sale were million and million of securities on deposit with insurance regulators  as required by law  at december  and  respectively 
in addition  substantially all of our fixed maturity and equity securities are traded on public markets 
for a further discussion regarding investments  see investments operations segment included in this item net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities during and of million and million  respectively 
net cash from operations will vary from period to period if there are significant changes in underwriting results  primarily a combination of the level of premiums written and loss and loss expenses paid  changes in cash flows from investment income or federal income tax activity 
the majority of the change between and was due to our settlement payment of million related to the 
pool change and our payment of million related to our share of the state auto group s initial net unearned premium transfer under the ho qs arrangement 
the lower level of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the same period was driven by the significant increase in the level of loss and loss expenses paid due to the record level of catastrophe losses that occurred in as compared to the same period 
the and operational cash activity included cash inflows of million and million  respectively  due to pooling changes 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for and  respectively  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the following factors significantly contributed to the fluctuations between those years in early we continued to raise funds to complete the settlement of amounts owed related to the 
pool change and the ho qs arrangement 
in  we sold equity securities and certain fixed maturity securities in order to accumulate cash to be in a position to settle the transfers related to the 
pool change with the mutual pooled companies in early also in  we had a cash inflow of million  primarily related to our sale of sa national  compared to a cash outflow of million in the amount paid in approximated sa national s cash position on that date 
borrowing arrangements credit facility state auto financial has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders which matures in september the credit facility 
during the term of the credit facility  we have the right to increase the total facility to a maximum amount of million  provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and provides for interest only payments during its term  with principal and interest due in full at maturity 
interest is based on libor or a base rate plus a calculated margin amount 
the credit facility includes certain covenants  including financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum net worth and not exceed a certain debt to capitalization ratio 
as of december   state auto financial had not made any borrowings and was in compliance with all of its covenants 
senior notes state auto financial has outstanding million of unsecured senior notes due november the senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  which is payable each may and november the senior notes are general unsecured obligations ranking senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness and equal with all existing and future senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any of state auto financial s subsidiaries and thereby are effectively subordinated to all state auto financial s subsidiaries existing and future indebtedness 
in early  state auto p c became a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb 
we intend to refinance the senior notes with a secured borrowing with the fhlb 
subordinated debentures state auto financial s delaware business trust subsidiary the capital trust has outstanding million liquidation amount of capital securities  due in connection with the capital trust s issuance of the capital securities and the related purchase by state auto financial of all of the capital trust s common securities liquidation amount of million  state auto financial has issued to the capital trust million aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate junior subordinated debt securities due the subordinated debentures 
the sole assets of the capital trust are the subordinated debentures and any interest accrued thereon 
interest on the capital trust s capital and common securities is payable quarterly at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus  adjusted quarterly 
the applicable interest rates for december  and were and  respectively 
notes payable summary the following table sets forth our notes payable at december  millions carrying value fair value interest rate senior notes due issued million  november with fixed interest subordinated debentures due issued million  may with variable interest adjusting quarterly total notes payable related to our notes payable  our primary market risk exposure is to the change in interest rates and our credit rating 
for a discussion regarding our credit ratings see credit and financial strength ratings included in this item based upon the notes payable carrying value at december   we had million notes payable with variable interest and million notes payable with interest fixed at  which equated to approximately variable interest debt and fixed interest debt 
our decision to obtain fixed versus variable interest rate debt is influenced primarily by the following factors a current market interest rates  b anticipated future market interest rates  c availability of fixed versus variable interest instruments  and d our currently existing notes payable fixed and variable interest rate position 
see our contractual obligations table included in contractual obligations included in this item reinsurance arrangements members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
to minimize the risk of reinsurer default  the state auto group cedes only to third party reinsurers who are rated a or better by am best or standard poor s and also utilizes both domestic and international markets to diversify its credit risk 
we utilize reinsurance to limit our loss exposure and contribute to our liquidity and capital resources 
homeowners quota share reinsurance arrangement on december   the state auto group entered into the ho qs arrangement  which is a three year quota share reinsurance agreement covering our homeowners book of business 
under the ho qs arrangement  the state auto group cedes to reinsurers of its homeowners business under policies in force at the effective date and new and renewal policies thereafter issued during the term of the agreement 
the ho qs arrangement remains in place until december  a reinsurer may terminate its participation in the ho qs arrangement upon the occurrence of certain events  including  without limitation  if the policyholders surplus of the state auto group is reduced by more than from the amount of its surplus as of september  or the state auto group is assigned an am best rating below a 
under the ho qs arrangement  the state auto group receives a commission on all premiums ceded to the reinsurers during the term of the agreement 
subject to the terms and conditions of the ho qs arrangement  the state auto group may receive a profit commission 
the ho qs arrangement provides the reinsurers with certain contractual rights in the event of a material adverse change  as defined in the agreement  occurs to the state auto group 
for example  the reinsurers may request the revision or renegotiation of certain terms of the agreement if the state auto group s homeowners exposure growth exceeds specified levels or if the state auto group makes significant underwriting  claim handling or business mix changes that adversely impact the business reinsured under the agreement 
in the event the parties do not agree on revised terms  the reinsurers may cancel the ho qs arrangement 
under the material adverse change provisions  the reinsurers may reduce the ceding commission proportionally in the event the homeowners rate changes implemented fall short of our pricing plan by more than certain stipulated contractual amounts 
under the ho qs arrangement  the reinsurers have agreed to accept of the state auto group s subject homeowners net liability 
the liability of the reinsurers will not exceed any of the following million as to any one risk with respect to property losses  million as to any one insured with respect to liability losses  million as to all losses arising from any one loss occurrence  of the ceded net earned premium for the first contract year with respect to all losses arising from all catastrophe loss occurrences commencing during the first contact year  subject to an amount not to exceed million for the first contract year  of the ceded net earned premium for the second contract year with respect to all losses arising from all catastrophe loss occurrences commencing during the second contact year  subject to an amount not to exceed million for the second contract year  of the ceded net earned premium for the third contract year with respect to all losses arising from all catastrophe loss occurrences commencing during the third contract year  subject to an amount not to exceed million for the third contract year  or of the ceded net earned premium for the term of the agreement with respect to all losses arising from all catastrophe loss occurrences commencing during the term of the agreement  subject to an amount not to exceed million for the term of the contract 
a catastrophe loss occurrence is defined as any one loss occurrence which has been assigned a catastrophe number by the iso pcs 
we believe this reinsurance arrangement reduces risk and volatility in the homeowners line of business and to our overall book of business while providing us with additional catastrophe protection 
other reinsurance arrangements each member of the state auto group is party to working reinsurance treaties for casualty  workers compensation and property lines with several reinsurers arranged through reinsurance intermediaries 
these agreements are described in more detail below 
we have also secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations 
the state auto group also participates in state insurance pools and associations 
in general  these pools and associations are state sponsored and or operated  impose mandatory participation by insurers doing business in that state  and offer coverage for hard to place risks at premium rates established by the state sponsor or operator  thereby transferring risk of loss to the participating insurers in exchange for premiums which may not be commensurate with the risk assumed 
property catastrophe members of the state auto group maintain a property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance agreement  covering catastrophe related events affecting at least two risks 
as of june   this property catastrophe reinsurance agreement was revised to include property business written through our specialty insurance segment 
under this agreement  the state auto group retains the first million of catastrophe loss  each occurrence  with a co participation on the next million of covered loss  each occurrence

the state auto group also is responsible for an additional million in aggregate retention per treaty year for losses exceeding million 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually

this agreement provides for a proportional share of losses on all coastal wind policies written with limits greater than million and up to million of covered loss and all non coastal wind policies written with limits greater than million and up to million of covered loss 
the reinsurers limit cannot exceed more than million on any one risk 
casualty and workers compensation as of july   the state auto group revised its casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement to include coverage for umbrella liability and workers compensation losses 
under this agreement  each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of workers compensation  umbrella  auto and other liability losses 
the reinsurance agreement provides coverage up to million 
policies underwritten by the rockhill unit are not subject to this casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement 
for workers compensation risks  the state auto group also renewed a treaty that provides million of coverage in excess of million retention  subject to an additional million in annual aggregate retention 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of million retention for each loss occurrence 
this reinsurance sits above the million excess of million arrangement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
policies underwritten by the rockhill unit are not subject to this casualty excess of loss reinsurance agreement 
in addition to the workers compensation reinsurance described above  each company in the state auto group is party to an agreement which provides an additional layer of reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any one life limitation of million 
this limitation means that losses associated with each worker may contribute no more than million to covered loss under this agreement 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
for liability policies written through our rockhill unit  the state auto group has a consolidated casualty treaty whereby it retains the first million of covered loss and the reinsurers are responsible for of loss in excess of million up to million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
as of october   the state auto group entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement for management professional liability arising out of certain classes of business underwritten in our rockhill unit

regulatory considerations at december   and  each of our insurance subsidiaries was in compliance with statutory requirements relating to capital adequacy 
the naic utilizes a collection of analytical tools designed to assist state insurance departments with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
one such set of analytical tools is key financial ratios that are known in the insurance industry as the iris ratios 
a defined range of results for each ratio has been established by the naic for solvency monitoring 
while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring our insurance companies operating performance on a statutory accounting basis each of our insurance subsidiaries operates within the defined range for the other measures  the net premiums written to surplus or leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of our insurance subsidiaries continue to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the following table sets forth the statutory leverage ratios for our insurance subsidiaries at december   and statutory leverage ratios state auto p c milbank sa ohio weighted average table excludes the one time impact on net written premiums of million  million and million occurred in conjunction with the pool change  the

our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to state auto financial which in turn may be used by state auto financial to pay dividends to shareholders or to make principal and interest payments on debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay without prior approval 
under current law  million is available in for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to state auto financial  without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
state auto financial received million and million in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in and  respectively 
we are required to notify the insurance subsidiaries applicable state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all such dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary state commissioner of each insurance subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business 
the naic has developed risk based capital requirements  which attempts to relate an individual insurance company s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations 
rbc requires the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
at december   the ratio of total adjusted statutory capital to authorized control level of state auto financial s insurance subsidiaries ranged from to 
credit and financial strength ratings the following table sets forth our credit and insurance company financial strength ratings as of february  am best moody s standard poor s state auto financial credit rating bbb baa bb stable outlook negative outlook negative outlook state auto group financial strength a a bbb stable outlook negative outlook negative outlook we are reviewed regularly by the independent rating agencies  including those rating agencies listed in the table above 
we believe that these ratings provide a meaningful way for policyholders  agents  creditors  shareholders and others to compare us to our competitors 
our ratings are influenced by many factors  including operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  financial leverage  exposure to catastrophe risks and operating leverage 
the credit ratings set forth above relate to the senior notes issued by state auto financial and express the opinion of the rating agency as to the ability of state auto financial to meet its ongoing obligations under the terms of the senior notes 
generally  credit ratings affect the cost  type and availability of debt financing 
higher rated securities receive more favorable pricing and terms relative to lower rated securities at the time of issue 
the financial strength ratings set forth above relate to the state auto group and express the opinion of the rating agency as to the ability of the state auto group to meet its ongoing obligations to policyholders 
the am best financial strength rating influences our ability to write insurance business as agents and policyholders generally prefer higher rated companies 
lower rated companies may be required to compete for agents and policyholders by offering higher commissions or lower premiums and expanded coverage  or a combination thereof 
other impact of inflation inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  we attempt to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
even when general inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  is relatively modest  as has been the case over the last several years  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims can steadily increase 
for example  medical care costs have risen at a higher rate than general inflation over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following widespread natural catastrophes  such as the industry experienced in with hurricane ike 
we continue to adjust our pricing projections to reflect current and anticipated changes in costs in all lines of business 
we consider inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and final settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses
