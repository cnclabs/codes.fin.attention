critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories and any related reserves  income taxes  fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the board of directors audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on sales of products when the customer receives title to the goods  which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on sales terms 
revenues are generally denominated in the currency of the country from which the product is shipped and are net of applicable returns and discounts 
shipping fees billed to customers are included in net revenues and shipping costs are included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities in applicable jurisdictions are excluded from net revenues 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer product  food beverage  and wine spirit companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities and are carried at sales value less allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history  age  account payment status compared to invoice payment terms and specific individual risks identified 
the delinquency of an account receivable is determined based on these factors 
the company does not accrue interest on aged accounts receivable 
allowances are recorded and charged to expense when an account is determined to be uncollectible 
losses may also depend to some degree on current and future economic conditions 
although future conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal if we are unable to collect all or part of the outstanding receivable balance  there could be a material impact on the company s operating results and cash flows 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and are maintained using the fifo first in  first out or specific identification method 
excess and obsolete cost reductions are generally established based on inventory age 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill is not amortized and the company tests goodwill for impairment annually  as of the last day of february of each fiscal year 
impairment is also tested when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than the fair values 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over periods of up to twenty years based on a number of assumptions including estimated period of economic benefit and utilization 
intangible assets are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than their fair values 
the company s  of goodwill at march  relates primarily to the acquisitions of collotype in  centrostampa and monroe etiquette in fiscal  la cromografica  wdh and york in fiscal and labelgraphics in fiscal the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment allowed by the revised accounting guidance and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of the company to the carrying value 
the fair value was independently calculated by american appraisal as of february  by calculating multi color s marketable control equity value and comparing it to the company s book value of equity 
the result of the first step did not indicate potential impairment as the estimated fair value of its reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately  as a result  the second step of the impairment test was not required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment exists involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
changes in the market condition and or losses of a production line could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
the company did not record any material impairment charges to long lived assets during fiscal income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable 
deferred income taxes are recognized at the enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences related to temporary differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and financial reporting purposes as well as any tax attributes 
deferred income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the us that have been permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
we regularly review our deferred income tax balances for each jurisdiction to estimate whether these deferred income tax balances are more likely than not to be realized based on the information currently available 
projected future taxable income is based on forecasted 
table of contents results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the timing of reversals of any existing temporary differences is based on our methods of accounting for income taxes and current tax legislation 
unless the deferred tax balances are more likely than not to be realized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying values of any deferred tax balances until circumstances indicate that realization becomes more likely than not 
the company establishes reserves for income tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether it is more likely than not that the tax uncertainty would be sustained upon challenge by the appropriate tax authorities which would then result in additional taxes  penalties and interest due 
provisions for and changes to these reserves and any related net interest and penalties are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
significant judgment is required when evaluating our tax provisions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we regularly review our tax positions and we adjust the reserves as circumstances change 
derivative financial instruments the company accounts for derivative financial instruments by recognizing derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value and recognizing the resulting gains or losses as adjustments to earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company manages interest costs using a mixture of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
additionally  the company enters into interest rate swaps swaps whereby it agrees to exchange with a counterparty  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company s swaps have been designated as effective cash flow hedges at inception 
the company evaluates effectiveness on an ongoing quarterly basis and therefore  any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
if a hedge or portion thereof is determined to be ineffective  any changes in fair value would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
the company manages foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward currency contracts 
the forward contracts have been designated as effective fair value hedges at inception 
the company evaluates effectiveness on an ongoing quarterly basis and therefore  any changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of income to offset the foreign currency effect of the transactions 
fair value measurements the carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value 
the company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements  the company uses a three level hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs 
the three levels are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level unobservable inputs the determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment 
the company has three non amortizing interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of  at march  to convert variable interest rates on a portion of outstanding debt to fixed interest rates 
the company adjusts the carrying value of these derivatives to their estimated fair values and records the adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company has entered into multiple forward contracts to fix the us dollar value of presses  other equipment and intercompany loans 
the forward contracts were designated as fair value hedges 
the company adjusts the carrying value of the derivative to the estimated fair value and records the adjustment in the consolidated statements of income 
fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses  the valuation of acquired intangibles and in the valuation of assets held for sale 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually  as of the last day of february of each fiscal year 
impairment is also tested when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying values may be greater than the fair values
