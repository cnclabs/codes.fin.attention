technology and operations our on demand products use a central application and a single software code base with unique accounts for each customer 
as a result  we are able to spread the cost of providing our products across our entire customer base 
in addition  because we have one central application  we believe we are able to scale our business to meet increases in demand for our products 
scalability is achieved through advanced use of application partitioning to allow for horizontal scaling across multiple sets of applications 
this structure enables individual application subsystems to scale independently as required by volume and usage

production data is backed up on a daily basis and stored in multiple locations to ensure transactional integrity and restoration capability 
we protect our customers data using security practices and technology solutions that are often unavailable to small organizations 
we do not use our customers confidential information  including their contact lists  except in the delivery of our product  nor do we sell or rent this information 
changes to our production environment are tracked and managed through a formal maintenance request process

as of december   we had employees working in our engineering and product strategy organizations 
competition the market for vendors offering online marketing tools is fragmented  competitive and evolving 
few competitors offer multiple products and none offer our complete suite of engagement marketing tools for small organizations 
we believe the following are the principal competitive factors in this market brand  ease of use and effectiveness  integrated solutions  product functionality  performance and reliability  customer support  coaching and education  affordability  and product scalability 
our email marketing product primarily competes with vendors focused on the small and medium size business market  or smb market 
some of the vendors who are focused on the smb email market include aweber systems  inc  icontact corporation  a subsidiary of vocus  inc  protus  a subsidiary of j global communications  inc campaigner  the rocket science group llc mailchimp  vertical response  inc and vistaprint nv these vendors typically charge a low monthly entry fee or a low fee per number of emails sent and  in some cases  they have a free offering 
while we generally do not compete with vendors focusing on enterprise or larger customers  we may compete with them in the future 
we may also face future competition in the email marketing market from new companies entering our market  which may include large  established companies 
our event marketing product competes with offerings by eventbrite  inc  evite  llc a wholly owned  operating business of iac interactivecorp  regonline  a division of the active network  inc  and cvent  inc 
our social campaigns product competes with offerings by offerpop corporation  pagemodo  a subsidiary of vistaprint nv  vocus social media llc doing business as north social and wildfire interactive  inc our savelocal product competes with offerings by groupon  inc  livingsocial  inc  amazon local and googleoffers 
our singleplatform product competes with offerings by yext  inc and locu  inc 
our survey product competes with offerings by surveymonkey 
com corporation and widgix  llc doing business as surveygizmo 

table of contents barriers to entry in delivering online marketing point solutions for small organizations are relatively low  which allows new entrants to enter the market without significant impediments and larger  established companies to develop their own competitive products or acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our competitors 
in addition  some of these companies may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
these potential competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns 
these competitors may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships that they could leverage to obtain a significant portion of the market 
in addition  these competitors may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do 
moreover  if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors or a new market entrant  the change in competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
finally  one or more of these businesses could decide to offer competitive products at no cost or low cost in order to generate revenue as part of a larger product offering 
we believe our easy to use  affordable and integrated products  education  knowhow and coaching differentiate us from the competition 
government regulation the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of  or can spam act  establishes requirements for commercial email and specifies penalties for commercial email that violates the can spam act 
in addition  the can spam act gives consumers the right to require emailers to stop sending them commercial email 
the can spam act covers email sent for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product  service  or internet website 
the us federal trade commission  or the ftc  a federal consumer protection agency  is primarily responsible for enforcing the can spam act  and the us department of justice  other federal agencies  state attorneys general  and isps also have authority to enforce certain of its provisions 
the can spam act s main provisions include prohibiting false or misleading email header information  prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines  ensuring that recipients may  for at least days after an email is sent  opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender  with the opt out effective within days of the request  requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively assented to receiving the message  and requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message 
the can spam act also prohibits unlawful acquisition of email addresses  such as through directory harvesting  and transmission of commercial emails by unauthorized means  such as through relaying messages with the intent to deceive recipients as to the origin of such messages 
violations of the can spam act s provisions can result in criminal and civil penalties  including statutory penalties that can be based in part upon the number of emails sent  with enhanced penalties for commercial emailers who harvest email addresses  use dictionary attack patterns to generate email addresses  and or relay emails through a network without permission 

table of contents the can spam act acknowledges that the internet offers unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce  and the can spam act was passed  in part  to enhance the likelihood that wanted commercial email messages would be received 
we believe we are a leader in developing policies and practices affecting our industry and that our permission based email marketing model and our anti spam policy are compatible with current can spam act regulatory requirements 
we are a founding member of the email sender and provider coalition  or espc  a cooperative industry organization founded to develop and implement industry wide improvements in spam protection and solutions to prevent inadvertent blocking of legitimate commercial email 
we maintain high standards that apply to all of our customers  including non profits and political organizations  whether or not they are covered by the can spam act 
the can spam act preempts most state laws specific to email  except for common law trespass  contract  or tort laws  state laws specifically prohibiting falsity or deception in commercial email and state laws relating to fraud and computer crime 
the scope of these exceptions  however  is not settled  and some states have adopted email regulations that  if upheld  could impose liabilities and compliance burdens on us and on our customers in addition to those imposed by the can spam act 
in addition  we may be subject to regulation by the ftc and each of the states under general consumer protection statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts and practices 
certain areas of marketing activity  including email marketing and online advertising  are subject to specific statutes such as the can spam act discussed above 
these federal or state statutes and rules also effectively regulate online user s privacy and data security  particularly in the e commerce area where the ftc and state attorneys general actively investigate the policies and practices of online companies regarding the protection  sharing or use of personal information furnished by customers to the websites 
to the extent our customers are small businesses or individuals  we may be subject to regulation and enforcement oversight in these areas 
moreover  some foreign countries  including the countries of the european union  israel and canada  have regulated or are in the process of regulating the distribution of commercial email and the online collection and disclosure of personal information 
to the extent we conduct business operations in certain foreign countries  such as the united kingdom and canada  we may be subject directly to the laws in these countries 
in addition  foreign governments may attempt to apply their laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with us governmental entities 
our customers may be subject to the requirements of the can spam act  and or other applicable state or foreign laws and regulations affecting email marketing 
if our customers email campaigns are alleged to violate applicable email laws or regulations and we are deemed to be responsible for such violations  or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements  we could be exposed to liability 
intellectual property our intellectual property rights are important to our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark  patent and other rights in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology  processes and other intellectual property 
others may develop products that are similar to our technology 
we enter into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees  consultants  partners and vendors  and through these and other written agreements  we attempt to control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary technology and other information 
these confidentiality and other written agreements  however  offer only limited protection  and we may not be able to enforce our rights under such agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  third parties may  in an unauthorized manner  attempt to use  copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our product 
policing unauthorized use of our products and intellectual property rights is difficult and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis 
therefore  we cannot be certain that the steps we have 
table of contents taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriations of our technology or intellectual property rights 
constant contact is a registered trademark in the united states  canada and in the european union 
we also hold trademarks and service marks identifying certain of our products or features of our products 
we currently hold one issued us patent and have two patent applications pending in the us patent and trademark office 
employees as of december   we had  employees 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our relations with our employees are good 
facilities our corporate headquarters  including our principal administrative  marketing  sales and support and research and development organizations  is located in waltham  massachusetts 
we currently lease approximately  square feet in this facility under a lease agreement  as amended  that expires in september with one ten year extension option 
we expect to occupy approximately  additional square feet in this facility over the next three years 
as of december   of our employees were based in this facility 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in loveland  colorado under a lease agreement that will expire in april with three three year extension options 
this facility is used for sales and support personnel and  as of december   employees were based in this location

the other new york facility houses singleplatform and our london facility houses marketing personnel 
as of december   five employees were based in florida  employees were based in california  employees were based in new york and three employees were based in london 
if we require additional space  we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable  commercially reasonable terms 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks 
we caution you that the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the sec 
risks related to our business and industry if we are unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers  our business and results of operations will be affected adversely 
to succeed  we must continue to attract and retain a large number of customers 
over the last few years  there has been a decline in the number of new customers we have added on an annual basis 
in  we added fewer new customers than we added in and in we added fewer new customers then we added in either or we rely on a variety of methods to attract new customers  such as paying providers of online services  
table of contents search engines  directories and other websites to provide content  advertising banners and other links that direct customers to our website  television and radio advertising  the efforts of our partners and the inclusion of a link to our website in substantially all of our customers emails 
in addition  we are committed to providing our customers with a high level of support 
as a result  we believe many of our new customers are referred to us by existing customers 
however  customers cancel their accounts for many reasons  including economic concerns  business failure or a perception that they do not use our product effectively  the service is not a good value and that they can manage their online marketing efforts without our products 
in some cases  we terminate an account because the customer fails to comply with our standard terms and conditions 
as our customer base continues to grow  even if our customer retention rates remain the same on a percentage basis  the absolute number of customers we lose each month will increase 
we must continually add new customers to replace customers whose accounts are cancelled or terminated  which may involve significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate 
if we are unable to use any of our current marketing initiatives or the cost of such initiatives were to significantly increase or such initiatives or our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful  we may not be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers on a cost effective basis and  as a result  our business and results of operations would be affected adversely 
our business is substantially dependent on the market for email marketing services for small organizations 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from our email marketing product for small organizations  including small businesses  associations and non profits 
for the year ended december   our revenue from our email marketing product alone was approximately of our total revenue 
widespread acceptance of email marketing among small organizations will continue to be critical to our future growth and success 
there is no certainty regarding how the market for email marketing will continue to develop  or whether it will experience any significant contractions 
our ability to attract and retain customers will depend in part on our ability to make email marketing convenient  effective and affordable 
if small organizations determine that email marketing does not sufficiently benefit them or utilize alternative or new electronic methods of communicating with their customers  existing customers may cancel their accounts and potential customers may decide not to adopt email marketing 
if the market for email marketing services fails to continue to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  demand for our services may decline and our revenue would suffer 
our growth strategy requires us to expand our product offerings beyond email marketing and this expansion may not be successful 
we have traditionally focused our business on providing our email marketing product for small organizations  but in the last few years we have expanded our product offerings 
in  we introduced our survey product and our add on email archive service that enables our customers to archive their past email campaigns 
in  we launched our event marketing product 
through our acquisition of nutshell mail  inc  which we completed in may  we now provide a tool for small organizations to monitor and engage with social media networks 
in january  we launched our social campaigns product which allows small businesses the ability to run multi step  results oriented campaigns on their social networks 
also  in january  we announced the acquisition of cardstar  a leading developer of mobile applications that extend the use of loyalty  rewards and membership cards and mobile coupons among consumers 
in february  we announced the introduction of our new savelocal product  which makes it quick and easy for our customers to create  run and manage local deals 
in june  we acquired singleplatform  a company that helps small business get discovered through web and mobile searches by providing a single place to update relevant business information 
our efforts to introduce new products beyond our email marketing product or to offer a bundled offering of two or more of our products may not result in significant revenue growth  may not be complementary to our email marketing product  may not be timely  may divert management resources from our existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business or product  any of which may harm our financial performance and impede our long term growth strategy 

table of contents us federal legislation and the laws of many foreign countries impose certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails  which could minimize the effectiveness of our products  particularly our email marketing product  and establish financial penalties for non compliance  which could increase the costs of our business 
the can spam act establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content 
the can spam act  among other things  obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender 
in addition  some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the can spam act  particularly utah and michigan  which have enacted do not email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content  such as adult or other harmful products 
some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the can spam act 
the ability of our customers constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our products 
moreover  non compliance with the can spam act carries significant financial penalties 
if we were found to be in violation of the can spam act  applicable state laws not preempted by the can spam act  or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email such as the laws of canada and the united kingdom  whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements  we could be required to pay penalties  which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business  and our reputation would suffer 
we also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business  which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or could increase our operating costs 
if the security of our customers confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access  our reputation may be severely harmed  we may be exposed to liability and we may lose the ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option 
our system stores our customers proprietary email distribution lists  credit card information and other critical data 
any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose us to liability for the loss of such information  adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments  time consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity  which could severely damage our reputation 
if security measures are breached because of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited  and  as a result  a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers data  our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged  and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target  we and our third party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
in addition  as we continue to grow our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized  we may become a more inviting target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems 
many states  including massachusetts  have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data 
these mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity  which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures 
any security breach  whether actual or perceived  would harm our reputation  and we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers 
in addition  if we fail to maintain our compliance with the data protection policy standards adopted by the major credit card issuers  we could lose our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option 
any loss of our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option would harm our reputation and make our products less attractive to many small organizations by negatively impacting our customer experience and significantly increasing our administrative costs related to customer payment processing 

table of contents our existing general liability insurance may not cover any  or cover only a portion of any  potential claims related to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage would increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income 
the market in which we participate is highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
the market for our products is highly competitive and rapidly changing  and the barriers to entry are relatively low 
with the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants to the market  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future  which could harm our ability to increase sales  limit customer attrition and maintain our prices 
our principal email marketing competitors include providers of email marketing products for small to medium size businesses such as aweber systems  inc  icontact corporation  a subsidiary of vocus  inc  protus  a subsidiary of j global communications  inc campaigner  the rocket science group llc mailchimp  vertical response  inc and vistaprint nv these vendors typically charge a low monthly entry fee or a low fee per number of emails sent and  in some cases  they have a free offering 
competition could result in reduced sales  reduced margins or the failure of our email marketing product to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  there are a number of other vendors that are focused on providing email marketing products for larger organizations  including alterian inc  cheetahmail  inc  a subsidiary of experian group limited  exacttarget  inc  responsys inc  silverpop systems inc  eloqua limited  a subsidiary of oracle corporation  and strongmail systems  inc while we do not compete currently with vendors of email marketing products serving larger customers  we may compete with these providers in the future 
finally  in the future  our email marketing product may experience competition from internet service providers  or isps  advertising and direct marketing agencies and other large established businesses  possessing large  existing customer bases  substantial financial resources and established distribution channels 
if these companies decide to develop  market or resell competitive email marketing products  acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors  our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our operating results could be harmed 
in addition  one or more of these entities could decide to offer a competitive email marketing product at no cost or low cost in order to generate revenue as part of a larger product offering 
our other products also face intense competition 
eventspot  our event marketing product  competes with offerings by eventbrite  inc  evite  llc  a wholly owned  operating business of iac interactivecorp  regonline  a division of the active network  inc  and cvent  inc 
our social campaigns product competes with offerings by offerpop corporation  pagemodo  a subsidiary of vistaprint nv  vocus social media llc doing business as north social and wildfire interactive  inc our survey product competes with similar offerings by surveymonkey 
com corporation and widgix  llc doing business as surveygizmo 
our savelocal product competes with offerings by groupon  inc  livingsocial  inc  amazon local and googleoffers 
our singleplatform product competes with offerings by yext  inc and locu  inc 
our current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
our current and potential competitors may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have 
in addition  these companies may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have and may be able to bundle email marketing  event marketing or survey products with other products that have already gained widespread market acceptance and offer them at no cost or low cost 
these competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns 
if we are unable to compete with such companies  the demand for our products could substantially decline 

table of contents current economic conditions may further negatively affect the small business sector  which may cause our customers to terminate existing accounts with us or cause potential customers to fail to purchase our products  resulting in a decrease in our revenue and impairing our ability to operate profitably 
our products are designed specifically for small organizations 
these organizations frequently have limited budgets and are often resource and time constrained and  as a result  may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than their larger  more established counterparts 
we believe that small organizations continue to experience some amount of economic hardship 
as a result  small organizations may choose to spend the limited funds that they have on items other than our products and may experience higher failure rates 
moreover  if small organizations experience economic distress  they may be unwilling or unable to expend time and financial resources on marketing  which would negatively affect the overall demand for our products  increase customer attrition and could cause our revenue to decline 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions  or a recurring recession  will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating and financial results 
any significant disruption in service on our website or in our computer systems  or in our customer support services  could result in a loss of customers 
the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations  level of customer service  reputation and ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers 
in providing our services  we rely on third party hosting facilities  bandwidth providers  isps and mobile networks 
our production system hardware and the disaster recovery operations for our production system hardware are co located in third party hosting facilities 
these facilities do not guarantee that our customers access to our products will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
our operations also depend on the ability of our third party hosting facilities to protect their and our systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters  power or telecommunications failures  air quality  temperature  humidity and other environmental concerns  computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems  criminal acts and similar events 
in the event that our third party hosting arrangements are terminated  or there is a lapse of service or damage to these facilities  we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities 
in addition  our customer support services  which are located at our headquarters in waltham  massachusetts and at our sales and support office in loveland  colorado  would experience interruptions as a result of any disruption of electrical  phone or any other similar facility support services 
any interruptions or delays in access to our products or customer support  whether as a result of third party error  our own error  natural disasters  security breaches or malicious actions  such as denial of service or similar attacks  whether accidental or willful  could harm our relationships with customers and our reputation 
also  in the event of damage or interruption  our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur 
these factors could damage our brand and reputation  divert our employees attention  reduce our revenue  subject us to liability and cause customers to cancel their accounts  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our production disaster recovery system is located at one of our third party hosting facilities 
our corporate disaster recovery system is located at our headquarters in waltham  massachusetts 
neither system provides real time backup or has been tested under actual disaster conditions and neither system may have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage 
in the event of a disaster in which our production system hardware and the disaster recovery operations for our production system hardware are irreparably damaged or destroyed  we would experience interruptions in access to our products 
moreover  our headquarters and our production system hardware are located within several miles of each other 
as a result  any regional disaster could affect these locations equally 
any or all of these events could cause our customers to lose access to our products  which will harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents if a third party asserts that we are infringing its intellectual property  whether successful or not  it could subject us to costly and time consuming litigation or require us to obtain expensive licenses  and our business may be adversely affected 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
third parties  including so called non practicing entities  which are entities that have no operating business but exist purely as collectors of patents  may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of lawsuits  letters or other forms of communication 
these claims  whether or not successful  could divert management s attention  result in costly and time consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the case of open source software related claims  require us to release our software code under the terms of an open source license  or require us to redesign our software and services to avoid infringement 
as a result  any third party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business 
in addition  many of our agreements with our partners and others require us to indemnify them for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling on any such claim 
even if we have not infringed any third party s intellectual property rights  we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful  and even if we are successful in defending against such claims  our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time 
finally  if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights  royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party 
we may be subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
from time to time  we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits by partners  customers  or other parties arising in the ordinary course of business  including lawsuits alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a party to the actions that are described in part i  item legal proceedings included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources  and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  the results of any of these actions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if the delivery of our customers emails is limited or blocked  customers may cancel their accounts 
isps can block emails from reaching their users 
the implementation of new or more restrictive policies by isps may make it more difficult to deliver our customers emails 
we continually improve our own technology and work closely with isps to maintain our deliverability rates 
if isps materially limit or halt the delivery of our customers emails  or if we fail to deliver our customers emails in a manner compatible with isps email handling or authentication technologies or other policies  then the fees we charge for our email marketing product may not be accepted by the market  and customers may cancel their accounts 
this  in turn  could harm our business and financial performance 

table of contents if we fail to promote and maintain our brands in a cost effective manner  we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease 
we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the constant contact brands in a cost effective manner is critical to our goal of achieving widespread acceptance of our engagement marketing platform and attracting new customers 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our industry increases 
successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the effectiveness and affordability of our products for our target customer demographic 
historically  our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense  and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur additional significant expenses 
such brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and  even if they do  any revenue increases may not offset the expenses we incur to promote our brands 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands successfully  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  we may lose our existing customers to our competitors or be unable to attract new customers  which would cause our revenue to decrease 
we depend on search engines to attract a significant percentage of our customers  and if those search engines change their listings or our relationship with them deteriorates or terminates  we may be unable to attract new customers  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
many of our customers located our website by clicking through on search results displayed by search engines such as google  yahoo and bing 
search engines typically provide two types of search results  algorithmic and purchased listings 
algorithmic listings cannot be purchased  and instead are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine 
purchased listings can be purchased by advertisers in order to attract users to their websites 
we rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract a significant percentage of the customers we serve to our website 
search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search result listings 
if search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms  this could result in fewer potential customers clicking through to our website  requiring us to resort to other costly resources to attempt to replace this traffic  which  in turn  could reduce our revenue and negatively impact our operating results  harming our business 
if one or more search engines on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us  our expenses could rise  or our revenue could decline and our business may suffer 
the cost of purchased search listing advertising fluctuates and may increase as demand for these channels grows  and any such increases could negatively affect our financial results 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of email as a communications tool and the related expansion and reliability of the internet infrastructure 
if consumers do not continue to use email or alternative communications tools gain popularity  such as social media or text messaging  demand for our email marketing product may decline 
the future success of our business depends on the continued and widespread adoption of email as a primary means of communication 
security problems such as viruses  worms and other malicious programs or reliability issues arising from outages and damage to the internet infrastructure could create the perception that email is not a safe and reliable means of communication  which would discourage businesses and consumers from using email 
use of email by businesses and consumers also depends on the ability of isps to prevent unsolicited bulk email  or spam  from overwhelming consumers inboxes 
in recent years  isps have developed new technologies to filter unwanted messages before they reach users inboxes 
in response  spammers have employed more sophisticated techniques to reach consumers inboxes 
although companies in the anti spam industry have started to address the techniques used by spammers  if security problems become widespread or frequent or if isps cannot effectively control spam  the use of email as a means of communication may decline as consumers find alternative ways to communicate 
in addition  if alternative communications tools  such as social media or text messaging  gain widespread acceptance  the need for email may lessen 
any decrease in the use of email would reduce demand for our email marketing product and harm our business 

table of contents various private spam blacklists have in the past interfered with  and may in the future interfere with  the effectiveness of our products and our ability to conduct business 
we depend on email to market to and communicate with our customers  and our customers rely on email to communicate with their customers and members 
various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation 
these entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam 
some of these entities maintain blacklists of companies and individuals  and the websites  isps and internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate 
if a company s internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity  emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any internet domain or internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity s service or purchases its blacklist 
some of our internet protocol addresses currently are listed with one or more blacklisting entities and  in the future  our other internet protocol addresses may also be listed with these and other blacklisting entities 
there can be no guarantee that we will not continue to be blacklisted or that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists 
blacklisting of this type could interfere with our ability to market our products and services and communicate with our customers and could undermine the effectiveness of our customers marketing campaigns  all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations 
our customers use of our products and website to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications in violation of our policies or otherwise could damage our reputation  and we may face liability for unauthorized  inaccurate or fraudulent information distributed via our products 
our customers could use our products or website to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications  reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission  or report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information 
any such use of our products could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages  copyright or trademark infringement  defamation  negligence or fraud 
moreover  our customers promotion of their products and services through our products may not comply with federal  state and foreign laws 
we cannot predict whether our role in facilitating these activities would expose us to liability under these laws 
even if claims asserted against us do not result in liability  we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims 
if we are found liable for our customers activities  we could be required to pay fines or penalties  redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability 
our customers use of our savelocal product may negatively impact our reputation and could subject us to legal and regulatory risks  each of which could harm our business and results of operations 
our brand and reputation may be harmed by our customers use of our savelocal product 
any shortcomings of one or more of our savelocal customers  particularly with respect to an issue affecting the quality of the deal offered or the products or services sold or such customer s fraudulent or deceptive conduct  may be attributed to us  potentially damaging our reputation and brand value  reducing our ability to attract new customers or retain our current customers and subjecting us to potential liability  thereby negatively affecting our results of operations 
the application of certain us and international laws and regulations to savelocal deals and to our role in facilitating our customers offer of savelocal deals is uncertain 
these include laws and regulations such as the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of  or the card act  the laws of most states  which contain provisions governing product terms and conditions of gift cards  gift certificates  stored value or pre paid cards or coupons and unclaimed and abandoned property laws 
these laws may include provisions prohibiting or limiting the use of expiration dates on gift cards or the amount of fees charged in connection with gift cards or requiring specific disclosures on or in connection with gift cards and the imposition of certain fees 

table of contents if we are required to alter our business practices as a result of any laws or regulations  our revenue could decrease  our costs could increase and our business could otherwise be harmed 
in addition  the costs and expenses associated with defending any actions related to such additional laws and regulations and any payments of related penalties  judgments or settlements could adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  if any laws or regulations require that the face value of savelocal coupons have a minimum expiration period beyond the period desired by our savelocal customers for their promotional programs  or no expiration period  this may affect the willingness of our customers to use our savelocal product in jurisdictions where these laws apply 
our business may be negatively impacted by seasonal trends 
sales of our products are impacted by seasonality 
the third calendar quarter has typically been our slowest quarter for customer growth because our prospective customers typically do not engage as much with their customers during the slower summer months 
we typically increase our sales and marketing activities at the end of the third quarter and during the fourth quarter in anticipation of the holiday season 
if these seasonality trends change materially  our financial and operating results for any given quarter may be negatively impacted and may differ materially from results in prior quarterly periods 
in addition  our recent acquisition of singleplatform may impact our historical seasonality trends 
if we fail to enhance our existing products or develop new products  our products may become obsolete or less competitive and we could lose customers 
if we are unable to enhance our existing products successfully  including our current plans to update our editing environment and improve our contact management functionality  or develop new products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and meet our customers needs  our business will be harmed 
creating and designing such enhancements and new products entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time  and there is no guarantee that such enhancements and new products will be completed in a timely fashion  nor is there any guarantee that any new product offerings will anticipate our customer s needs or gain acceptance among our customers or in the broader market 
in addition  such enhancements and new products may not be profitable for a number of years  if at all  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 
our existing customers and prospective new customers may be dissatisfied with our enhancements to our existing products and may leave us or choose competing providers  or may not view any new product as complementary to our other product offerings and not purchase such additional products 
if we cannot successfully enhance our existing services or develop new products or if we are not successful in implementing such enhancements and selling new products to our customers  we could lose customers or have difficulty attracting new customers  which would adversely impact our financial performance 
our relationships with our partners may not be as successful in generating new customers as we anticipate  which could adversely affect our ability to increase our customer base 
we maintain a network of different types of partners  some of whom refer customers to us through links on their websites and outbound promotion to their customers  resell our products and create integrations with our products 
we have invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance our partners effectiveness  however  these programs could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue 
we also rely on some of our partners to create integrations with third party applications and platforms used by our customers 
if we fail to encourage our partners to create such integrations  demand for our products could decrease  which would harm our business and operating results 
if we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing partners or establish new contractual relationships with potential partners  we may experience delays and increased costs in adding customers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the number of customers we are able to add through these relationships is dependent on the marketing 
table of contents efforts of our partners over which we exercise very little control  and a significant decrease in the number of new customers generated through these relationships or failure of our investment in partner programs to be effective could adversely affect the size of our customer base and revenue 
competition for employees in our industry is intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees whom we need to support our business 
competition for highly skilled engineering and marketing personnel is intense and we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel in certain areas of our business and in certain locations 
we may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment 
in particular  candidates making employment decisions  particularly in high technology industries  often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment 
as a result  any significant volatility in the price of our stock  including the recent decline in share value  may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled engineering and marketing personnel 
in addition  we invest significant time and expense in training our employees  which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them 
if we fail to retain our employees  we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements and the quality of our services and our ability to serve our customers could diminish  resulting in a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of our singleplatform offering is based  in part  on the quality of the content provided by our singleplatform customers and our ability to maintain a strong network of publishers 
our singleplatform customers provide us with current information about their business that we  in turn  provide to our network of electronic publishers  such as foursquare  yp 
com and urbanspoon 
the success of the singleplatform offering depends  in part  on our ability to provide these publishers and their consumers with the information they seek  which in turn depends on the quantity and quality of the content provided by our singleplatform customers 
for example  we may be unable to provide these publishers and their consumers with the information they seek if our customers do not contribute content that is helpful  reliable and up to date  or if they remove content they previously submitted 
if our singleplatform product does not provide content that is helpful  reliable and up to date  our ability to maintain our current network of electronic publishers and sign up new publishers could be harmed 
if we are unable to provide our electronic publishers and their consumers with the information they seek  or if they can find equivalent content on other services  they may stop or reduce their use of our product  which could negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers and our business would be harmed 
if we fail to retain our key personnel  we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer 
our future depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our future also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key technical and marketing personnel  each of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  gail f 
goodman  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  is critical to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction 
the loss of the services of ms 
goodman or other executive officers or key personnel and the process to replace any of our key personnel would involve significant time and expense  may take longer than anticipated and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives 
we rely on third party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our service and that requires us to closely monitor our usage to ensure that we remain in compliance with any applicable licensing requirements 
we rely on computer hardware purchased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our products  including hardware and software from such large vendors as international business machines corporation  dell 
table of contents computer corporation  par inc  a division of the hewlett packard company  oracle corporation  juniper networks  inc  cisco systems  inc  ciena corporation and emc corporation 
this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we lose the right to use any of this hardware or software or such hardware or software malfunctions  our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our services until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology or repair the malfunctioning hardware or software 
any delays or failures associated with our services could upset our customers and harm our business 
in addition  if we fail to remain in compliance with the licensing requirements related to any third party computer hardware and software we use  we may be subject to unanticipated expenses  auditing costs  penalties and the loss of such hardware and software  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our unpatented proprietary information  processes and know how and trade secrets  the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected 
we rely heavily upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes and know how and trade secrets 
although we try to protect this information in part by executing confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties  such agreements may offer only limited protection and may be breached 
any unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of our proprietary technology  processes and know how or our trade secrets  whether by breach of a confidentiality agreement or otherwise  may cause irreparable harm to our business  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information  processes and know how or our trade secrets are disclosed  the value of our technology and services could be adversely affected  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products 
we incorporate open source software into our products 
although we monitor our use of open source software closely  the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by united states or foreign courts  and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products 
in such event  we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  to re engineer our products or to discontinue sales of our products  or to release our software code under the terms of an open source license  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
given the nature of open source software  there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs 
our anticipated growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure  and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our anticipated growth  we may not be able to implement our business plan successfully 
we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations  which has placed  and will continue to place  to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth  a significant strain on our management and our administrative  operational and financial reporting infrastructure 
our success will depend in part on the ability of our senior management to manage this expected growth effectively 
to do so  we believe we will need to continue to hire  train and manage new employees as needed 
if our new hires perform poorly  or if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing and integrating these new employees  or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and update our reporting procedures and systems 
the expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth will increase our cost base  
table of contents which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term 
if we fail to manage our anticipated growth successfully  we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully 
providing our products to customers outside the united states exposes us to risks inherent in international business 
customers in more than countries and territories currently use our products 
in  we opened a marketing office in the united kingdom and we may continue to expand our international operations in the future 
accordingly  we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
the risks and challenges associated with providing our products to customers outside the united states include localization of our products  including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including those relating to tax  email  privacy and data protection  foreign currency fluctuations  different pricing environments  difficulties in staffing and maintaining foreign operations  and regional economic and political conditions 
if we fail to meet these risks and challenges  we will be unable to execute our business plan and may be subject to fines and regulatory actions 
we have incurred net losses in the past and expect to incur net losses on a quarterly basis in the future 
we have incurred net losses in the past and expect to incur net losses on a quarterly basis in the future 
we reported net income for  and  however  we experienced net losses in prior years and a net loss for the second quarter of while we expect to generate future profitability  we may experience net losses in future periods  particularly quarterly periods 
in addition  we expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to expand our operations 
if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in order to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act s requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting  we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance related issues 
we expect to continue to incur such expenses and expend such time in the future 
if in the future we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nasdaq stock market  the sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards in the united states may be limited 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of million for us federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
these loss carry forwards expire at varying dates between 
table of contents and to the extent available  we intend to use these net operating loss carry forwards to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
while our analysis shows that our public stock offerings and prior private financings have not resulted in ownership changes that would limit our ability to utilize net operating loss carry forwards  any subsequent ownership changes could result in such a limitation 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carry forwards is significantly limited  our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carry forwards  which could have a negative effect on our financial results 
our quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  our stock price could decline substantially 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
some of the important factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include our ability to attract new customers  retain existing customers and satisfy our customers requirements  general economic conditions  average revenue per customer  changes in our pricing policies  our ability to expand our business  our ability to execute successfully on our strategy  new product and service introductions  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services as a result of our actions or those of third parties  the timing of additional investments in our hardware and software systems  the seasonal trends in our business  regulatory compliance costs  costs associated with future acquisitions of technologies and businesses and our ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions  and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute related settlement payments 
some of these factors are not within our control  and the occurrence of one or more of them may cause our operating results to vary widely 
as such  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  and may dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
we have historically relied on outside financing and cash from operations to fund our operations  capital expenditures and growth 
we may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations  respond to competitive pressures  take advantage of strategic opportunities  including more rapid expansion of our business or the acquisition of complementary products  technologies or businesses  and develop new products or enhancements to existing products 

table of contents we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  if and when we require it  our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have completed four acquisitions in the past three years  including our most recent acquisition of singleplatform in june we have  from time to time  evaluated other acquisition opportunities and may pursue acquisition opportunities in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including an inability to locate a suitable acquisition candidate or technology or acquire a desirable candidate or technology on favorable terms  difficulties in integrating personnel and operations from the acquired business or acquired technology with our existing technology and products and in retaining and motivating key personnel from the acquired business  disruptions in our ongoing operations and the diversion of our management s attention from their day to day responsibilities associated with operating our business  increases in our expenses that adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition  potential write offs of acquired assets and increased amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired  and potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt 
in addition  any acquisitions we complete may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or such an acquisition may be viewed negatively by our customers  stockholders or the financial markets 
risks related to the ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors 
some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us  quarterly unique customer additions and customer retention rates  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  success of competitive products  our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products  contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances

in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any of the foregoing occurs  it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 
if securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not control these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable

executive overview we are a leading provider of on demand engagement marketing tools  including email marketing  social media marketing  event marketing and surveys  for small organizations  including small businesses  associations and non profits 
we also now offer a mobile storefront offering through the acquisition of singleplatform 
we seek to help our customers succeed and have a long history of delivering affordable  easy to use products  support  knowhow and coaching  all of which allow our customers to create and grow their customer relationships 
we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources including online marketing  including search engines and advertising on online networks and other websites  offline marketing through television and radio advertising  local seminars  relationships with our partners  referrals from our growing customer base  general brand awareness and the inclusion of a link to our website in the footer of substantially all of the emails sent by our customers 
we have grown rapidly since launching our first on demand product in we ended with approximately  unique paying customers and had revenue for that year of million 
our business strategy focuses on expanding beyond email marketing to support a multi product strategy to drive high customer lifetime value 
we believe increasing our customer s lifetime value will be a key contributor to our continued success 
to drive lifetime value we will continue to focus on acquiring customers in a cost effective manner  increasing average revenue per customer through cross selling and increased product usage and improving customer retention rates 
during  we significantly expanded our product suite from three products to six 
we now have a suite of online marketing tools for small organizations including the following new products we launched social campaigns in january social campaigns allows users to create  publish  promote and run campaigns on facebook that offer promotions or content targeted toward those who like them and to incent others to like and share them 
in january  we acquired cardstar  inc  a leading developer of mobile applications that extend the use of loyalty  rewards and membership cards and mobile coupons among consumers

savelocal  is an online tool that helps small businesses run local deals  gives merchants control of the deal and allows small businesses to incentivize social sharing to attract qualified new customers  and drive repeat business at an affordable price 
in june  we began offering savelocal to the broader market 
in june  we acquired singleplatform  a company that helps small businesses get discovered through web and mobile searches by providing a single place to update important business information 
singleplatform enables businesses to reach more than million consumers across its extensive publishing network 
see also note  acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

key financial and operating metrics in connection with the ongoing operation of our business  our management regularly reviews key financial and operating metrics 
given our growth strategy  we pay particular attention to customer life time value  customer acquisition metrics  trialer growth  customer attrition  success in cross selling and growing customer list sizes  number of products per customer and average revenue per customer 
we also consider other financial and operating metrics such as revenue  gross margin  expenses  customer satisfaction rates  average speed of answer for customer support calls  email deliverability rates and capital expenditures  among others 
management considers these financial and operating metrics critical to understanding and improving our business  reviewing our historical performance  benchmarking our performance versus other companies and identifying current and future trends  and for planning purposes 
in addition  we consider the following non gaap financial measures to be key indicators of our financial performance adjusted ebitda  which we define as gaap net income loss plus depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  and adjusted for contingent consideration adjustment and interest and other income expense and income taxes  adjusted ebitda margin  which we define as adjusted ebitda divided by revenue  non gaap net income  which we define as gaap net income loss plus stock based compensation and adjusted for contingent consideration adjustment and the non cash portion of income taxes  and free cash flow  which we define as net cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment 

table of contents we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations 
these non gaap financial measures  however  are not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for gaap financial measures  including but not limited to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary should be considered along with the factors set forth under part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we continue to closely monitor current economic conditions both in the us and abroad  particularly as they impact small businesses  associations and non profits 
we believe that small organizations continue to experience some amount of economic hardship 
if this economic hardship continues or worsens  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our long term strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to generate interest in our existing products and to enhance and expand our product offerings to serve the online marketing needs of small businesses  associations and non profits 
if we fail  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
in connection with our acquisition of singleplatform  we incurred an obligation to the former shareholders of singleplatform to pay additional cash consideration of up to million  contingent on the achievement of certain revenue targets from july through june  measured in six month intervals 
based on certain assumptions and estimates  we recorded an estimated liability of million as of the acquisition date 
we subsequently decreased the amount recorded for this estimated liability in the third and fourth quarters of so that the liability was at december  based on a change of estimate in the achievement of the revenue goals 
we will continue to assess these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis 
changes in the estimated liability related to updated assumptions and estimates and to the actual revenue achievement will be recognized within the consolidated statements of operations 
if our assumptions and estimates change significantly or if actual revenue achievement is significantly different than our estimates  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected 
see also note  acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition  our operating results could be adversely impacted if we fail to successfully integrate singleplatform  if we fail to continue to successfully sell singleplatform s product or if the acquisition significantly disrupts our ongoing operations 
we believe that given the size of our potential market and the relatively low barriers to entry  competition may increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits by partners  customers  or other parties arising in the ordinary course of business  including lawsuits alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a party to actions that are described in part i  item legal proceedings included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources  and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  the results of any of these actions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents we believe that as we continue to grow revenue at expected rates  our cost of revenue and operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  while expected to decline on a percentage of revenue basis  will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
for a description of the general trends we anticipate in various expense categories  see cost of revenue and operating expenses below 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
accordingly  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide access to our products primarily through subscription arrangements whereby the customer is charged a fee for access for a defined term 
subscription arrangements include access to use our software via the internet and support services  such as telephone  email and chat support 
when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured  we recognize revenue on a daily basis over the subscription period as the services are delivered 
delivery is considered to have commenced at the time the customer has paid for the products and has access to the account via a log in and password 
we also generate a small amount of revenue from our savelocal product by charging a fee to our customers based on the number of deals sold by our customers and the value of the successful deal 
we recognize revenue from the fee charged when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured 
we also offer ancillary services to our customers related to our subscription based products such as custom services and training 
when sold together  revenue from custom services  training and our subscription products are accounted for separately based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each of the services as those services have value on a standalone basis and do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria 
revenue from custom services and training is recognized as the services are performed 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes related to timing differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements by applying a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances 
table of contents warrant a review 
we perform our assessment for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and we have determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this annual goodwill impairment assessment 
for purposes of assessing potential impairment  we annually estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization and compare this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit as reflected by our total stockholders equity 
if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge would be required 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill on november  based upon that evaluation  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits or  if that pattern cannot be readily determined  on a straight line basis 
software and website development costs 
relative to development costs of our on demand products and website  we capitalize certain direct costs to develop functionality as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are probable to result in additional functionality 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized as part of property and equipment until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
once placed in use  capitalized software is amortized over a three year period in the expense category to which the software relates 
stock based compensation 
we value all stock based compensation  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  at fair value on the date of grant  and expense the fair value over the applicable service period 
the straight line method is applied to all awards with service and market conditions  while the graded vesting method is applied to all awards with both service and performance conditions 
we base the fair value of common stock on the quoted market price of our stock 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units for awards with time based and performance based vesting conditions are based on the fair value of common stock on the date of grant 
we value restricted stock units with market based vesting criteria using a monte carlo simulation model 
the number of awards expected to be earned  based on achievement of the market condition  is factored into the grant date monte carlo valuation for the awards 
the grant date fair value is not subsequently adjusted regardless of the eventual number of awards that are earned based on the market condition 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method for estimating the expected term for awards that qualify as plain vanilla options 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the publicly traded stocks of a peer group of companies  inclusive of us  commencing october the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury bond yields at or near the time of grant for time periods similar to the expected term of the award 
the relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants is as follows years ended december  weighted average risk free interest rate expected term in years weighted average expected volatility expected dividends these assumptions represented our best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
authoritative guidance requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest 
in developing a 
table of contents forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for awards with service conditions 
for awards with performance conditions we estimate the probability that the performance condition will be met 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense associated with outstanding equity awards  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
fair value of financial instruments certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under gaap 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable  are used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available  which might include our own data 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying customers and the subscription fees for our products and is not concentrated within any one customer or group of customers 
in  our top customers accounted for less than of our total revenue 
we generally do not require our customers to commit to a contractual term  however  our customers are required to prepay for subscriptions on a monthly  semi annual  or annual basis by providing a credit card or bank check 
fees are recorded initially as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a daily basis over the prepaid subscription period 
in february  we launched our savelocal product for which we charge a fee based on the number of deals sold by our customers and the value of the successful deal 
we have not yet generated significant revenue from this product 
we also generate a small amount of revenue from ancillary services related to our products  which primarily consist of custom services and training through our experts program 
revenue generated from professional services and training accounted for approximately of gross revenue for each of the years ended december   and cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain occupancy and general office related expenses  such as rent  utilities  office supplies and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount 
as a result  an occupancy expense allocation is reflected as personnel related costs in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of wages and benefits for software operations and customer support personnel  credit card processing fees and depreciation and amortization  maintenance and hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings 
we allocate a portion of customer support costs relating to assisting trial customers to sales and marketing expense 

table of contents the expenses related to our hosted software applications are affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our products and the complexity and redundancy of our software applications and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase our number of customers but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we gain efficiencies created by our expected revenue growth and cost savings 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for product strategy and development personnel 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use  functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as on the development of new product offerings 
we primarily expense research and development costs 
however  direct development costs related to software enhancements that add functionality are capitalized and amortized over their useful life 
we expect that on an annual basis research and development expenses will continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue due to our expanded investment in our product roadmap over the next twelve months 
over the longer term we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  partner referral fees  the portion of customer support costs that relate to assisting trial customers and amortization of sales and marketing relating intangible assets 
advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click advertising with search engines  other online and offline advertising media  including television and radio advertisements  as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
promotional costs consist primarily of public relations  memberships and event costs 
in order to continue to grow our business and brand and category awareness  we expect that we will continue to commit substantial resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect that on an annual basis  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for administrative  human resources  internal information technology support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  board compensation and expenses  certain taxes and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
therefore  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but remain flat as a percentage of revenue over the next year 
over the longer term we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
acquisition costs and other related charges 
acquisition costs and other related charges include expenses associated with third party professional services we utilize related to the evaluation and execution of successful acquisitions

we expect to evaluate quarterly remeasurements of the fair value of this liability until it is settled at six month intervals through june we may also continue to incur acquisition costs and other related charges in future periods if we complete additional acquisitions

during  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets primarily as a result of continued profitability and forecasted future results 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we released our valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets

table of contents in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to of revenue to support our future growth  which will consist primarily of hardware and software purchases  capitalization of internal use software and furniture and leasehold improvements related to additional office space 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  development of new products  market acceptance of our products  the levels of advertising and promotion required to launch additional products and improve our competitive position in the marketplace  the expansion of our sales  support and marketing organizations  the establishment of additional offices in the united states and worldwide and the building of infrastructure necessary to support our anticipated growth  the response of competitors to our products and our relationships with suppliers and clients 
since the introduction of our on demand email marketing product in  we have experienced increases in our expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and personnel  and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings to fund our operations  develop or enhance products  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders or we may be subject to covenants that restrict how we conduct our business 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business 
we are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing activities 
we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities

the lease includes the space we are occupying now as well as additional space that will be made available to us through the term of the lease 
we lease office space in colorado for a sales and support office under an operating lease that expires in april with three three year extension options 
we also lease small amounts of general office space in florida  new york  california and the united kingdom under lease agreements that expire at various dates through we have agreements with various vendors to provide specialized space and equipment and related services from which we host our software application 
the agreements include payment commitments that expire at various dates through early as of december   we had issued both cancellable and non cancellable purchase orders and entered into contractual commitments with various vendors totaling million 
this amount relates primarily to marketing programs and other non marketing related goods and services to be delivered over the next twelve months 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total less than year years years more than years in thousands office lease obligations third party hosting agreements vendor commitments total as of december   we had an obligation to the former shareholders of singleplatform under which we are obligated to pay cash consideration of up to million  which is contingent on the achievement by singleplatform of certain revenue targets during the period from july  to june   measured in six month intervals 
as of december   the first target date  the targets had not been met and no amounts were paid 
based on our estimates of future revenue  we reduced our liability a level fair value measurement to as of december  as none of the forecasted revenue scenarios met the payout criteria 
we have not paid any of this consideration through december  and do not expect to pay any of the consideration based on our current revenue forecasts 
we will assess our forecasts and assumptions on a quarterly basis as additional data impacting the assumptions is obtained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
significantly all of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to material fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  as we increase our operations in international markets we will become increasingly exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december   which consisted of cash  government securities  corporate and agency bonds  certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market instruments 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  however  due to the nature of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates
