item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of heartland as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  heartland s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of heartland and its subsidiaries 
all of heartland s subsidiaries are wholly owned except for minnesota bank trust  of which heartland is an owner 
safe harbor statement this document including information incorporated by reference contains  and future oral and written statements of heartland and its management may contain  forward looking statements  within the meaning of such term in the private securities litigation reform act of  with respect to the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of heartland 
forward looking statements  which may be based upon beliefs  expectations and assumptions of heartland s management and on information currently available to management  are generally identifiable by the use of words such as believe  expect  anticipate  plan  intend  estimate  may  will  would  could  should or other similar expressions 
additionally  all statements in this document  including forward looking statements  speak only as of the date they are made  and heartland undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events 
heartland s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
the factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of heartland and its subsidiaries are detailed in the risk factors section included under item a 
of part i of this form k 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses 
these estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that management believes have the most effect on heartland s reported financial position and results of operations are as follows allowance for loan and lease losses the process utilized by heartland to estimate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting policy for heartland 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of identified and unidentified probable losses in the existing loan portfolio 
thus  the accuracy of this estimate could have a material impact on heartland s earnings 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined using factors that include the overall composition of the loan portfolio  general economic conditions  types of loans  loan collateral values  past loss experience  loan delinquencies  and potential losses from identified substandard and doubtful credits 
for loans individually evaluated and determined to be impaired  the allowance is allocated on a loan by loan basis as deemed necessary 
these estimates reflect consideration of one of three impairment measurement methods as of the evaluation date the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  the loan observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
all other loans  including individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired  are segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
loss rates for various collateral types of commercial and agricultural loans are established through assigned discount factors based upon the realizable value historically received on the various types of collateral 
for smaller commercial and agricultural loans  residential real estate loans and consumer loans  a historic loss rate is established for each group of loans based upon a twelve quarter weighted moving average loss rate 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is monitored on an ongoing basis by the loan review staff  senior management and the boards of directors of each bank subsidiary 
specific factors considered by management in establishing the allowance included the following heartland experienced an increase in net charge offs from through during the last several years  heartland has entered new geographical markets in which it had little or no previous lending experience 
heartland has continued to experience growth in more complex commercial loans as compared to relatively lower risk residential real estate loans 
there can be no assurances that the allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate to cover all loan losses  but management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses was adequate at december  while management uses available information to provide for loan and lease losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based on changes in economic conditions 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers may experience difficulty  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses carried by the heartland subsidiaries 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a new methodology  including the installation of new software  for the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the implementation of this new methodology included the establishment of a dual risk rating system  which allows the utilization of a probability of default and loss given default for commercial and agricultural loans in the calculation of the allowance for loan lease losses 
in addition to an enhanced allowance methodology  this software also has the ability to perform stress testing and migration analysis on various portfolio segments 
the table below estimates the theoretical range of the allowance outcomes and related changes in provision expense assuming either a reasonably possible deterioration in loan credit quality or a reasonably possible improvement in loan credit quality  in thousands theoretical range of allowance for loan and lease losses allowance for loan and lease losses at december  assuming deterioration in credit quality addition to provision resultant allowance for loan and lease losses assuming improvement in credit quality reduction in provision resultant allowance for loan and lease losses the assumptions underlying this sensitivity analysis represent an attempt to quantify theoretical changes that could occur in the total allowance for loan and lease losses given various economic assumptions that could impact inherent loss in the current loan and lease portfolio 
it further assumes that the general composition of the allowance for loans and lease losses determined through our existing process and methodology remains relatively unchanged 
it does not attempt to encompass extreme and or prolonged economic downturns  systemic contractions to specific industries  or systemic shocks to the financial services sector 
the addition to provision was calculated based upon the assumption that  under an economic downturn  the qualitative portion of the calculated allowance will increase due to increase in qualitative risk factors directly affected by the economic conditions 
the reduction in provision was calculated based upon the assumption that  under an economic upturn  the qualitative portion of the calculated allowance will decrease due to decrease in qualitative risk factors directly affected by the economic conditions 
goodwill and other intangibles we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including intangibles  at fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
in certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
additionally  estimated cash flows may extend beyond five years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and market conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  heartland reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates 
in assessing the fair value of reporting units  we may consider the stage of the current business cycle and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
also  we often utilize other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including public market comparables  and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
valuation multiples may be based on revenue  price to earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable companies and business segments 
these multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences  including size  operating leverage and other factors 
the carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the capital required to support the reporting unit s activities  including its tangible and intangible assets 
the determination of a reporting unit s capital allocation requires judgment and considers many factors  including the regulatory capital regulations and capital characteristics of comparable companies in relevant industry sectors 
in certain circumstances  we will engage a third party to independently validate its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in the market price for our common stock over a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
during the third quarter of  a calculation error was discovered in a valuation performed by an independent third party consultant and resulted in the recording of a goodwill impairment charge totaling million at rocky mountain bank 
after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors  we determined the amount was not material to the financial statements for and thus recorded such amount in the third quarter of a different third party consultant was engaged during the fourth quarter of to perform another valuation of the remaining goodwill recorded at rocky mountain bank 
based upon the updated valuation  we determined that no further goodwill impairment charges were required 
heartland conducted an internal assessment of the goodwill both collectively and at its subsidiaries in both and and determined no further goodwill impairment charges were required 
overview heartland is a diversified financial services company providing banking  mortgage  wealth management  investments  insurance and consumer finance services to individuals and businesses 
heartland currently has nine banking subsidiaries with locations in communities in iowa  illinois  wisconsin  new mexico  arizona  montana  colorado and minnesota and mortgage loan production offices in california  nevada  wyoming  idaho and north dakota 
in addition  heartland has separate subsidiaries in the consumer finance  insurance and property management businesses 
our primary strategy is to balance our focus on increasing profitability with asset growth and diversification through acquisitions  de novo bank formations and branch openings within existing market areas 
our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
noninterest income  which includes service charges and fees  loan servicing income  trust income  brokerage and insurance commissions  securities gains and gains on sale of loans  also affects our results of operations 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of the provision for loan and lease losses  salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  professional fees and fdic insurance premiums 
during the most recent years  our operating expenses have also been significantly impacted by net losses on repossessed assets

savings deposits increased million or since december   with million of this growth attributable to acquisitions 
certificates of deposit increased million or since year end  with million attributable to acquisitions and the offsetting decrease a result of more emphasis on growing the customer base in non maturity deposit products instead of higher cost certificates of deposit

simultaneous with receipt of the sblf funds  heartland redeemed the million of preferred stock issued to the us treasury in december under the capital purchase program  a part of the troubled asset relief program tarp 
as a result of this redemption  million in remaining unamortized discount on preferred stock was recognized during the third quarter of exclusive of this one time event  net income available to common stockholders for would have been million or per diluted common share 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as such  net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and yields on earning assets and the volume and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of tax equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest margin  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  was during compared to during and during net interest margin declined throughout  going from during the first quarter to during the fourth quarter 
this decline is a result of the sustained low interest rate environment where yields on the securities and loan portfolios are declining at a greater pace than rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
because deposit rates have been set at close to the bottom of their manageable range  and because the reinvestment rates on maturing securities have fallen dramatically and loan rates are presently impacted by competition for new loans  management anticipates net interest margin as a percentage will continue to decline  but believes net interest margin in dollars will increase as the amount of earning assets grows 
on a tax equivalent basis  interest income was million in compared to million in  a  or less than decrease 
during  interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased million or from million in the average interest rate earned on total earning assets was during compared to during and in the most significant contributor to these declines was the overall yield earned on the securities portfolio  which was in compared to in and in  a decrease of basis points during and basis points during average earning assets increased million or during  with approximately million attributable to acquisitions 
during  average earning assets increased million or compared to the composition of average earning assets changed as the percentage of average loans  which are typically the highest yielding asset  to total average earning assets was during compared to during and during interest expense for was million compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
during  interest expense decreased million or from million during interest rates paid on our deposits and borrowings decreased significantly during both and the average interest rate paid on heartland interest bearing deposits and borrowings was in compared to in and in these decreases resulted primarily from a change in the mix of deposits as balances shifted from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost interest bearing deposits 
average savings balances  as a percentage of total average interest bearing deposits  was during compared to for and in additionally  the average interest rate paid on savings deposits was during compared to during and during management continues to look for opportunities to reduce heartland funding costs 
certificates of deposit maturing within the next six months total million at an average interest rate of  and an additional million matures in the second half of the year at an average interest rate of 
for the past several months  the average renewal interest rate on maturing certificates of deposit has been ranging between and 
the rates currently paid on our non maturity deposits are effectively approaching a floor and we believe there is less flexibility to pay lower rates on these deposits in the future 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled million during  an increase of million or from the million recorded during net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million or during from million during these increases reflect heartland success in optimizing the composition of its interest bearing liabilities by de emphasizing higher cost time deposits 
we attempt to manage our balance sheet to minimize the effect that a change in interest rates has on our net interest margin 
we plan to continue to work toward improving both our earning asset and funding mix through targeted organic growth strategies  which we believe will result in additional net interest income 
we believe our net interest income simulations reflect a well balanced and manageable interest rate posture 
management supports a pricing discipline in which the focus is less on price and more on the unique value provided to business and retail clients 
approximately of our commercial and agricultural loan portfolios consist of floating rate loans that reprice based upon changes in the national prime or libor interest rate 
since nearly of these floating rate loans have interest rate floors that are currently in effect  an upward movement in the national prime interest rate would not have an immediate positive effect on our interest income 
item a of this form k contains additional information about the results of our most recent net interest income simulations

provision for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision charged to expense to provide  in heartland management s opinion  an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined by management using factors that include the overall composition of the loan portfolio  general economic conditions  types of loans  loan collateral values  past loss experience  loan delinquencies  substandard credits and doubtful credits 
for additional details on the specific factors considered  refer to the critical accounting policies and allowance for loan and lease losses sections of this report 
we believe the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december   was at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  if economic conditions should become more unfavorable  certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan and lease losses 
exclusive of loans covered under loss sharing agreements  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   was of loans and leases and of nonperforming loans compared to of loans and leases and of nonperforming loans at december   and of loans and leases and of nonperforming loans at december  the provision for loan losses was million during compared to million during  a million or decrease 
a reduction in the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses maintained for impaired loans was the primary contributor to the lower provision during the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses maintained for impaired loans was million at december   leaving the allowance on non impaired loans  exclusive of acquisitions  relatively stable at of loans and leases at december   compared to at december  the provision for loan losses totaled million for compared to million for the provision for loan and lease losses began increasing with the recession in  as depressed economic conditions resulted in increased delinquencies 
particularly affected were our western markets in arizona and montana 
the increased  although moderated  provisions continued during as some individual credits continued to be impacted and updated appraised values of collateral reflected a decline in property values due primarily to a lack of recent comparable sales and an extension of absorption periods 
during  the provision returned to a pre recession level  as property values stabilized and  in some areas  increased

service charges and fees increased  or from to  and increased  or from to service charges on checking and savings accounts increased  or during to million and increased  or during to million 
these fees were affected by increased service charges on commercial checking accounts as the earnings credit rate applied to the balances maintained in these accounts were at historically low levels and the resultant earnings credit was not sufficient to cover activity charges on these accounts 
overdraft fees totaled million during  million during and million during the  or decrease in was primarily due to the implementation of the revisions to regulation e that were effective august   and the impact of changes initiated to comply with fdic guidance related to overdraft privilege programs

significant expansion of our national residential mortgage unit  together with historically low interest rates  combined to generate significantly higher residential mortgage loan origination activity during and loan servicing income also includes the fees collected for the servicing of mortgage loans for others  which is dependent upon the aggregate outstanding balance of these loans  rather than quarterly production and sale of mortgage loans 
fees collected for the servicing of mortgage loans for others were million during compared to million during and million during the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others by heartland totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december   and billion at december  heartland believes long term success in the mortgage banking business will depend on its ability to shift toward originations of loans for the purchase of homes  which will drive revenue when the refinance boom comes to an end

in addition to expansion in our existing markets  we opened loan production offices during and in metro san diego  california  reno  nevada  buffalo  wyoming  meridian  idaho  and minot  north dakota 
new residential mortgage loans are originated under the heartland subsidiary bank brands in current banking markets or under the national residential mortgage brand in non footprint locations 
even though the origination of and year  fixed rate residential mortgage loans was slower during the first half of compared to the first half of  the gains on sale of loans increased as a result of better pricing received on the sale of these loans into the secondary market 
a bulk delivery method into the secondary market was implemented during the second quarter of instead of the individual delivery method that had been used previously 
at the same time  secondary market pricing began to be matched with origination pricing through the use of a software tool that assists in hedging the locked rate pipeline position 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  heartland began the pooling of certain newly originated mortgage loans into mortgage backed securities prior to delivery into the secondary market 
the following table summarizes heartland residential mortgage loan activity for the years indicated  in thousands as of and for the years ended december  mortgage servicing fees mortgage servicing rights income mortgage servicing rights amortization total residential mortgage loan servicing income valuation adjustment on mortgage servicing rights gains on sale of loans residential mortgage loans originated residential mortgage loans sold residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio trust fees increased  or during and  or during a large portion of trust fees are based upon the market value of the trust assets under management  which was billion at december   compared to billion at december   and billion at december  those values fluctuate throughout the year as market conditions improve or decline 
the total number of trust accounts was  at december   compared to  at december   and  at december  securities gains totaled million during compared to million during and million during during both years  volatility in the bond market provided opportunities to swap securities from one sector of the portfolio to another without significantly changing the duration of the portfolio 
during  we implemented a strategy of selling short less than years mortgage backed securities and replacing with well structured  non callable bonds  which are expected to protect us under a wider range of possible interest rate scenarios and decrease susceptibility to the mortgage prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
strategies implemented during included the sale of taxable municipal bonds and reinvestment into tax exempt municipal bonds and the shift of a portion of the securities portfolio from agencies to treasuries and shorter term mortgage backed securities 
additionally  during the first quarter of  a private label z tranche security with a book value of  was sold at a gain of million 
seven of these z tranche securities remain in heartland securities available for sale portfolio at a book value of  and a market value of million at december  management has not determined when any future sales of these securities will occur 
offsetting  in part  the securities gains during was an impairment loss on three private label mortgage backed securities totaling  recorded during the first quarter of this impairment charge related to a decline in the credit quality of these securities 
management does not anticipate further declines on these or any other securities within the portfolio due to credit quality  but will continue to monitor the portfolio for any further declines 
based on its analysis  management believes it is prudent to continue to hold these securities as their economic value exceeds their market value 
other noninterest income was million during compared to  during and million during affecting other noninterest income were payments due to or from the fdic under loss share agreements associated with the elizabeth state bank acquisition completed on july  payments due to the fdic totaled  during  whereas payments due from the fdic totaled  during and  during included in other noninterest income during was million in equity earnings which resulted from the sale of two low income housing projects within partnerships in which dubuque bank and trust company was a member and a  write up on the appraised value of real property obtained through collection efforts on nonperforming loans

categories contributing most significantly to this increase were salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  professional fees  advertising and other noninterest expenses 
during  noninterest expenses totaled million compared to million in  an million or increase 
significant contributors for this period were increases in salaries and employee benefits  professional fees and other noninterest expenses combined with decreases in fdic insurance assessments and net losses on repossessed assets 
the largest component of noninterest expense  salaries and employee benefits  increased million or in compared to  and increased million or during compared to a large portion of these increases resulted from the expansion of residential loan origination and the addition of personnel in the heartland mortgage and national residential mortgage unit

was put on hold until december of  when its ninth office was opened in aurora  illinois 
a tenth office was opened in peoria  illinois in and an eleventh office was opened in elgin  illinois in although repayment risk exists on all loans  different factors influence repayment risk for each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial and agricultural loans are the quality of the borrower s management and the health of national and regional economies 
additionally  repayment of commercial and agricultural real estate loans may be influenced by fluctuating property values and concentrations of loans in a specific type of real estate 
repayment on loans to individuals  including those on residential real estate  are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability as well as the value of the collateral underlying these credits  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances and deteriorating economic conditions 
these risks are described in more detail in item a 
risk factors of this form k 
we monitor loan concentrations and do not believe we have excessive concentrations in any specific industry 
our strategy with respect to the management of these types of risks  whether loan demand is weak or strong  is to encourage the bank subsidiaries to follow tested and prudent loan policies and underwriting practices which include i granting loans on a sound and collectible basis  ii ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan  iii administering loan policies through a board of directors  iv developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan category  and v ensuring that each loan is properly documented and  if appropriate  guaranteed by government agencies and that insurance coverage is adequate

in certain circumstances  we may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due 
in most cases  the modification is either a reduction in interest rate  conversion to interest only payments  extension of the maturity date or a reduction in the principal balance 
generally  the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near term  so a concessionary modification is granted to the borrower that would otherwise not be considered 
restructured loans accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles 
although many of our loan restructurings occur on a case by case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes  we have also participated in certain restructuring programs for residential real estate borrowers 
in general  certain residential real estate borrowers facing an interest rate reset that are current in their repayment status  are allowed to retain the lower of their existing interest rate or the market interest rate as of their interest reset date 
in addition  during  our bank subsidiaries began participating in the us department of the treasury home affordable modification program hamp for loans in its servicing portfolio

the bank subsidiaries have not been active in the origination of subprime loans

allowance for loan and lease losses the process we use to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting practice for heartland 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of identified and unidentified probable losses in the existing loan portfolio

the bank subsidiaries priced time deposit products competitively to retain existing relationship based deposit customers  but not to retain certificate of deposit only customers or to attract new customers

we continue to explore opportunities to expand our footprint of independent community banks 
given the current issues in the banking industry  we have changed our strategic growth initiatives from de novo banks and branching to acquisitions 
attention will be focused on markets we currently serve  where there would be an opportunity to grow market share  achieve efficiencies and provide greater convenience for current customers 
future expenditures relating to expansion efforts  in addition to those identified above  are not estimable at this time 
commitments and contractual obligations commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the heartland banks evaluate each customer creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the heartland banks upon extension of credit  is based upon management credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the heartland banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
at december   and december   commitments to extend credit aggregated million and million  and standby letters of credit aggregated million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   in thousands contractual obligations and other commitments payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years contractual obligations time certificates of deposit long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations other commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit total other commitments on a consolidated basis  we maintain a large balance of short term securities that  when combined with cash from operations  we believe are adequate to meet our funding obligations 
at the parent company level  routine funding requirements consist primarily of dividends paid to stockholders  including the us treasury under the sblf  debt service on our revolving credit arrangements and our trust preferred securities issuances  and payments for acquisitions 
the parent company obtains the funding to meet these obligations from dividends collected from the bank subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities 
at december   heartland s revolving credit agreements with two unaffiliated banks provided a maximum borrowing capacity of million  none of which had been borrowed 
one of these credit agreements contains specific financial covenants which are listed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   heartland was in compliance with these covenants 
the ability of heartland to pay dividends to its stockholders is dependent upon dividends paid by its subsidiaries 
the bank subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions on the amount they may pay in dividends 
to maintain acceptable capital ratios in the heartland banks  certain portions of their retained earnings are not available for the payment of dividends 
retained earnings that could be available for the payment of dividends to heartland under the regulatory capital requirements to remain well capitalized totaled approximately million as of december  liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to maintain a cash flow that is adequate to meet maturing obligations and existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund operations and to provide for customers credit needs 
the liquidity of heartland principally depends on cash flows from operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and its ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
operating activities provided cash of million during compared to million during and million in the biggest contributor to this change was activity in loans originated for sale which used cash of million during compared to million during and provided cash of million in cash used for the payment of income taxes was million in in comparison with million during and million during investing activities used cash of million during  million during and million during the proceeds from securities sales  paydowns and maturities were million during as compared to million during and million during purchases of securities used cash of billion during as compared to million during and million during the net increase in loans and leases used cash of million in  million in and million in net cash received in acquisitions was million in  and no acquisitions were completed in or financing activities provided cash of million during and million during and used cash of million in a net increase in deposit accounts provided cash of million during compared to million during  and a net decrease in deposit accounts used cash of million in activity in short term borrowings used cash of million during compared to providing million during and million in cash proceeds from other borrowings were million during compared to million during and million during repayment of other borrowings used cash of million during compared to million during and million during management of investing and financing activities  and market conditions  determine the level and the stability of net interest cash flows 
management attempts to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates to the extent possible  so that balance sheet growth is the principal determinant of growth in net interest cash flows 
our short term borrowing balances are dependent on commercial cash management and smaller correspondent bank relationships and  as such  will normally fluctuate 
we believe these balances  on average  to be stable sources of funds  however  we intend to rely on deposit growth and additional fhlb borrowings in the future 
in the event of short term liquidity needs  the bank subsidiaries may purchase federal funds from each other or from correspondent banks and may also borrow from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the bank subsidiaries fhlb memberships give them the ability to borrow funds for short and long term purposes under a variety of programs 
at december   heartland revolving credit agreements with two unaffiliated banks provided a maximum borrowing capacity of million  of which nothing had been borrowed 
these credit agreements contain specific covenants  with which heartland was in compliance on december  effects of inflation consolidated financial data included in this report has been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
presently  these principles require reporting of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  except for available for sale securities  trading securities  derivative instruments  certain impaired loans and other real estate which require reporting at fair value 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as on changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in today s volatile economic environment 
heartland seeks to insulate itself from interest rate volatility by ensuring that rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities respond to changes in interest rates in a similar time frame and to a similar degree 
see item a of this form k for a discussion on the process heartland utilizes to mitigate market risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
heartland market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk resulting from its core banking activities of lending and deposit gathering 
interest rate risk measures the impact on earnings from changes in interest rates and the effect on current fair market values of heartland assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the objective is to measure this risk and manage the balance sheet to avoid unacceptable potential for economic loss 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate market risk 
exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees of the banks and  on a consolidated basis  by heartland executive management and board of directors 
darling consulting group  inc has been engaged to provide asset liability management position assessment and strategy formulation services to heartland and its bank subsidiaries 
at least quarterly  a detailed review of the balance sheet risk profile is performed for heartland and each of its bank subsidiaries 
included in these reviews are interest rate sensitivity analyses  which simulate changes in net interest income in response to various interest rate scenarios 
these analyses consider current portfolio rates  existing maturities  repricing opportunities and market interest rates  in addition to prepayments and growth under different interest rate assumptions 
selected strategies are modeled prior to implementation to determine their effect on heartland interest rate risk profile and net interest income 
management does not believe that heartland primary market risk exposures have changed significantly in when compared to the core interest rate risk analysis utilized by heartland examines the balance sheet under increasing and decreasing interest scenarios that are neither too modest nor too extreme 
all rate changes are ramped over a month horizon based upon a parallel shift in the yield curve and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon 
using this approach  management is able to see the effect that both a gradual change of rates year and a rate shock year and beyond could have on heartland net interest income 
starting balances in the model reflect actual balances on the as of date  adjusted for material and significant transactions 
pro forma balances remain static 
this enables interest rate risk embedded within the existing balance sheet structure to be isolated from the interest rate risk often caused by growth in assets and liabilities 
due to the low interest rate environment  the simulations under a decreasing interest rate scenario were prepared using a basis point shift in rates 
the most recent reviews at december   and  provided the following results  in thousands net interest margin change from base net interest margin change from base year down basis points base up basis points year down basis points base up basis points we use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our future interest income or interest expense 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these derivative instruments  but believe we have minimized the risk of these losses by entering into the contracts with large  stable financial institutions 
the estimated fair market values of these derivative instruments are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we enter into financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by heartland to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not recorded on the balance sheet until the instrument is exercised 
heartland holds a securities trading portfolio that would also be subject to elements of market risk 
these securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
these securities had a carrying value of  at december   and  at december   and in both cases were less than of total assets
