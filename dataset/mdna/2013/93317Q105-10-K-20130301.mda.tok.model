item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading producer and exporter of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry from underground and surface mines located in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we also produce thermal coal  anthracite coal  metallurgical coke and coal bed methane gas 
as of december   we had approximately million metric tons of recoverable reserves throughout the world 
we currently operate active coal mines  a coke plant and a coal bed methane extraction operation located throughout alabama  west virginia  northeast british columbia  and the uk we operate our business through two principal business segments the us operations and canadian and uk operations 
the uk operations segment includes hard coking coal and thermal coal mines in both alabama and west virginia  a coke plant in alabama  and coal bed methane extraction operations also located in alabama 
our us operations are estimated to have approximately million metric tons of recoverable reserves 
the canadian mining operations currently operate three surface metallurgical coal mines in northeast british columbia coalfields the wolverine mine  the brule mine  and the willow creek mine 
the canadian mining operations is estimated to have approximately million metric tons of recoverable reserves 
our uk mining operation consists of an idled underground and an idled surface mine located in south wales 
the underground mine produced anthracite coal  which can be sold as a low volatile pci coal and the surface mine operations produced thermal coal 
our uk mining operations is estimated to have approximately million metric tons of recoverable reserves 
our sales of metallurgical coal in  and  which generally sells at a premium over our thermal coal  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of thermal coal in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
our sales of metallurgical coal were made primarily to steel companies located in europe  asia and south america and our sales of thermal coal were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers located primarily throughout alabama  west virginia  and the uk approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively  were derived from sales made to customers outside of the united states  primarily in japan  brazil  germany  korea and luxemborg 
although was a difficult year  we produced a total of million metric tons of metallurgical coal in  an increase of as compared to metallurgical coal production of million metric tons 
we sold million metric tons of metallurgical coal in  up from million metric tons of metallurgical coal sales in we also achieved revenue of billion  a decrease of compared with billion in while our average selling price for metallurgical coal decreased to in from in  representing a decrease of 
the weakness in the metallurgical coal market during resulted from a combination of slowing chinese demand growth  the weak economic environment in europe  and the recovery of australian supply  all of which resulted in an oversupply of metallurgical coal 
this oversupply of metallurgical coal put pressure on the selling price of metallurgical coal reducing the price to levels not experienced in several years 
in response to the weak metallurgical coal markets  we curtailed operations and projects  reduced costs and enhanced productivity 
on august   we announced plans to reduce capital spending to approximately million 
we also reduced production and spending at two of our three 
table of contents canadian mines in the fourth quarter  reduced production at the maple mine in west virginia  converted our brule mine from contractor operated to owner operated  idled our gauley eagle surface mine operation in west virginia and significantly reduced development spending at our aberpergwm underground coal mine operations in the uk industry overview and outlook global steel production for increased to a record billion metric tons from the previous record of billion metric tons set in annual steel production for asia was billion metric tons  an increase of compared to making asia share of global steel production in as compared to in steel production in north america increased for the year to million metric tons  while production in south america and europe decreased and  respectively  compared to according to the world steel association  global steel consumption is projected to increase approximately in from  driven largely by the china market which accounts for of global steel demand 
although the short term outlook for metallurgical coal is questionable  our long term outlook remains constructive 
the long term demand for metallurgical coal within all of our geographic markets is anticipated to remain strong as industry projections continue to suggest that global steelmaking will continue to require increasing amounts of high quality metallurgical coal 
while we remain positive on the long term outlook for metallurgical coal  we are focused on reducing spending and production until such time that coal prices and demand improve 
we expect our metallurgical coal production to be in line with production levels in of which approximately will be hard coking coal and will be low volatile pci coal 
we also expect our sales tons to significantly exceed production in we are well positioned to increase our production to capitalize on anticipated improvements in pricing and demand when market conditions warrant

table of contents cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to billion in as compared to  primarily due to the impact of a full year of results from the acquired western coal operations compared to only nine months for the prior year 
cost of sales also increased due to the acquisition of the north river mine in may of cost of sales from these acquired operations was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the timing of acquisitions  the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased sales volumes 
depreciation and depletion expense in increased million as compared to primarily due to the impact of a full year of results from the acquired western coal operations compared to only nine months for the prior year 
the increase was also due to a full year of the north river mining operations in our us segment compared to only eight months in the prior year 
depreciation and depletion from these acquired operations was million during the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year comparable period 
selling  general administrative expenses includes costs for corporate and direct administrative functions not directly assignable to an individual mine 
selling  general administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million of costs incurred in associated with the acquisition of western coal combined with cost savings derived from integrating the operations  offset in part by a full year of expenses associated with these operations 
the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july  and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value for two reporting units in the us operations segment and two reporting units in the canadian and uk operations segment 
the company also recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the impairment of a capitalized shale natural gas exploratory project during the third quarter of further  in connection with plans to reduce development spending at the aberpergwm underground coal mine in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million  of which million related to severance and other obligations and million related to the impairment of property  plant and equipment as the carrying values of certain assets exceeded their fair value 
the million other loss for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to losses on the sale and remeasurement to fair value of equity investments acquired through the western coal acquisition 
other income of million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a gain of million recognized on april  as a result of remeasuring to fair value the western coal shares acquired from audley capital in january  partially offset by a net loss on the sale and remeasurement to fair value of other equity investments that were acquired through the western coal acquisition 
interest expense  net of interest income was million in  an increase of million compared to the increase reflects a full year of interest on borrowings of billion on april  to fund a portion of the western coal acquisition as well as an increase in interest rates in the fourth quarter of due to the third amendment to the credit agreement combined with interest on the notes issued on november  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit as compared to expense in was primarily due to the pretax operating loss for as compared to the pretax operating income for the same period in the level of ordinary income in decreased substantially from  leading to income tax benefits in excess of income tax expense 
the and effective rates also reflect the benefit of our canadian and uk operations which are taxed at statutory rates lower than the statutory us rate  and the benefits of tax 
table of contents losses in excess of losses from continuing operations related to foreign financing activities 
additionally  the company recorded an impairment charge of billion of nondeductible goodwill in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion 
the current and prior year results also included the effect of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis us operations hard coking coal sales totaled million metric tons in  an increase of as compared to million metric tons during the average selling price of hard coking coal in was per metric ton  a decrease as compared to an average selling price of per metric ton in the decrease in the average selling price of hard coking coal reflects the weak global economy and the resulting decrease in demand for hard coking coal 
hard coking coal production totaled million metric tons in  representing an increase of as compared to  primarily due to increased production at the alabama underground mines 
thermal coal sales totaled million metric tons in as compared to million metric tons during the decrease was primarily due to decreased thermal coal sales at our west virginia operations as we idled a thermal coal surface mine in response to softening demand 
the average selling price in was per metric ton  down from the average selling price of per metric ton in lower average pricing also reflected the impact of a full year of lower prices for tons sold by the north river mine 
thermal coal production totaled million metric tons in  as compared to million metric tons in statistics for us operations are presented in the following table for the year ended december  tons of hard coking coal sold in thousands tons of hard coking coal produced in thousands average hard coking coal selling price per metric ton tons of thermal coal sold in thousands tons of thermal coal produced in thousands average thermal coal selling price per metric ton includes sales of both coal produced and purchased coal 
our us operations segment reported revenues of billion in  a decrease of million from the decrease in revenues was attributable to lower average selling prices for both hard coking coal and thermal coal  partially offset by increased hard coking coal sales volumes primarily due to a full year of sales volume from the west virginia and north river mining operations acquired in the second quarter of the decrease in average selling prices reflects the weak global economy 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to billion during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of an increase in hard coking coal sales volume and a full year of cost of sales from the west virginia and north river mining operations 
cost of sales related to these acquired operations were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents us operations reported operating income of million in  as compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment of a capitalized shale natural gas exploratory project of million coupled with lower average hard coking coal and thermal coal selling prices and increased cost of sales as a result of increased sales volumes 
canadian and uk operations the canadian and uk operations segment was acquired during the second quarter of as part of the western coal acquisition 
metallurgical coal sales for the year ended december  totaled million metric tons of hard coking coal at an average selling price of per metric ton and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal at an average selling price of per metric ton 
metallurgical coal sales for the year ended december  totaled million metric tons of hard coking coal at an average selling price of per metric ton and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal at an average selling price of per metric ton 
the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to a full year of sales volume from these operations compared to only nine months for the prior year 
the decrease in the average selling price of metallurgical coal was due to weaker worldwide demand 
the canadian and uk operations segment produced a total of million metric tons of hard coking coal and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the canadian and uk operations segment produced million metric tons of hard coking coal and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal 
the increase in production volumes was primarily due to the impact of a full year of production volume from these operations acquired through the western coal acquisition compared to only nine months for the prior year coupled with significant improvements in productivity at both the wolverine and brule mines 
due to the strong production of these operations combined with the weak market demand  beginning in the third quarter  we reduced production at two of our three canadian mines and made plans to reduce inventory while we await better market conditions 
we also are taking steps to restrain spending in our canadian and uk operations segment and significantly reduced development spending in the aberpergwm mine in the uk until market conditions improve

our canadian and uk operations segment reported revenues of million in  a decrease of million from reported revenues of million 
the decrease in the canadian and uk operations segment reported revenues was due to lower average selling prices for both hard coking coal and low volatile pci coal  partially offset by increased sales volumes 

table of contents cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of results from these operations acquired through the western coal acquisition compared to only nine months included within the prior year 
our canadian and uk operations segment reported an operating loss of billion for the year ended december  as compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  the billion decrease in operating income was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of million and asset impairment and restructuring charges of million for the year ended december   coupled with lower average hard coking coal and low volatile pci coal prices  in some cases to a point below cost

these recently acquired operations contributed million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase was driven by higher hard coking coal pricing from our us operations  partially offset by lower hard coking coal sales volumes 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to billion in as compared to  primarily as a result of the addition of the canadian and uk operations segment and the west virginia and north river mining operations within our us operations segment  which accounted for of the increase

our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for declined primarily due to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in addition  the tax expense for included a one time tax charge of million related to the elimination of the favorable tax treatment of medicare part d subsidies due to the passage of the health care reform act in march  as well as a one time tax benefit of million related to nonconventional fuel source credits for our walter coke operations for the years through segment analysis us operations our us operations segment reported revenues of billion in  an increase of million from the increase in revenues was primarily due to the addition of the west virginia and north river mining operations acquired in the second quarter of which added million in revenues to the segment  however at lower gross margins than those of the legacy operations 
increased revenues were also due to higher average selling prices for hard coking coal  partially offset by lower hard coking coal sales volumes 
the lower hard coking coal sales volumes in as compared to reflects lower production at our alabama underground mines due to geology issues during and weather related issues in the second quarter of statistics for us operations are presented in the following table for the year ended december  average hard coking coal selling price per metric ton tons of hard coking coal sold in thousands average thermal coal selling price per metric ton tons of thermal coal sold in thousands includes sales of both coal produced and purchased coal 
us operations reported operating income of million in  as compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was primarily due to the increase in cost of sales  a higher mix of lower margin thermal coal sales  and increased depreciation and depletion and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the recently acquired north river and west virginia operations 
cost of sales increased as a result of increased production costs at our alabama underground operations primarily due to difficult geological conditions and higher thermal coal sales volumes as well as higher royalty and freight costs 
canadian and uk operations results for represent the results of the segment since the april  date of acquisition 
the segment reported revenues of million and operating income of million 
results for were adversely impacted by challenging weather conditions during the second quarter and their lingering effects during the third quarter  delays in the issuance of mining permits at 
table of contents the willow creek mine  delays in the commissioning of the falling creek connector road and higher mining ratios at our northeast british columbia mining operations 
these conditions and delays impacted sales and production volumes during the year as well as production and transportation costs 
cost of sales during the fourth quarter for hard coking coal was negatively impacted by purchased coal related to the ridley terminal upgrade 
fourth quarter cost of sales for pci coal was also negatively impacted by our expediting the migration from a contractor base to owner base for our willow creek mine workers 
although this move will help lower overall future costs  it caused some short term increases as we prepared for the move

financial condition cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at december  from million at december   primarily resulting from the use of cash during for capital expenditures of million  million of principal payments on our term loans in advance of scheduled maturity  million of principal payments on capital lease obligations and dividends paid of million 
offsetting these uses of cash was million in cash flows provided by operating activities during and proceeds of million related to the issuance of our notes 
see additional discussion in the statement of cash flows section that follows 
net receivables were million at december   a decrease of million from december  primarily attributable to a decline in the average net selling price per metric ton of our hard coking and pci coals 
inventories increased by million at december  as compared to december  primarily due to increased production volumes coupled with decreased sales volumes 
net property  plant and equipment increased by million at december  as compared to december   primarily due to capital expenditures during of million  partially offset by depreciation expense 
accrued expenses were million at december   a decrease of million from december   primarily due to reduced capital spending resulting in lower capital accruals at year end 
the long term portion of the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation was million at december   up million from million at december  the increase was primarily attributed to a decrease in the discount rate offset by a decrease in health care cost trend rates 
this adjustment is recognized as a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity 
other current liabilities and other long term liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  an increase and decrease of million and million  respectively  from december  primarily due to the reclassification of approximately million in accrued interest  penalties  and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions from other long term liabilities to other current liabilities

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of short term funding are our existing cash balances  operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our principal sources of long term funding are our bank term loans entered into on april  and our senior notes issued on november   as discussed below 
our available liquidity as of december  was million  consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million and million available under the company million revolving credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreement and the indenture governing our notes as of december  if operating results fall below our fiscal year results or other adverse factors occur  they could result in our being unable to comply with covenants in our credit agreement 
a breach of covenants in the credit agreement  including the covenants that stipulate ratios based on adjusted ebitda  could result in a default under the credit agreement and the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any acceleration under the credit agreement could result in a default under the indenture governing our notes 
based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  we believe that funding provided by operating cash flows and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet substantially all of our operating needs  to make planned capital expenditures and to make all required interest and principal payments on indebtedness for the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors including prices of coal  coal production  costs of raw materials  interest rates and the general economy 
although we have observed recent improvement in the market for our products  renewed deterioration of economic conditions or deteriorating mining conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows 
additionally  although financial market conditions have improved  there remains volatility and uncertainty  limited availability of credit  potential counterparty defaults  sovereign credit concerns and commercial and investment bank stress 
while we have no indication that the uncertainty in the financial markets would impact our current credit facility or current credit providers  the possibility does exist 
senior notes on november   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december  the notes at an initial price of of their face amount

ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense  interest income  income taxes  and depreciation and depletion expense 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude goodwill impairment and asset impairment and restructuring charges 
ebitda is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with gaap and should be considered supplemental to  and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with gaap 
we believe that these non gaap measures provide additional insights into the performance of the company  and they reflect how management analyzes company performance and compares that performance against other companies 
in addition  we believe that ebitda is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use ebitda to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs

management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates are based upon management historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists or third party consultants 
a number of sources of information are used to determine accurate recoverable reserve estimates including geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  
table of contents previously completed geological and reserve studies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   our current operations had million metric tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
business combinations at the date of acquisition  we allocate the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values and may include the use of appraisals  consideration of market quotes for similar transactions  employment of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information we believe relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts  adjustments are recorded 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
once final  it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like mineral interests  property  plant and equipment and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates to reclaim surface lands and supporting infrastructure at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the us  canada and us as defined by each mining permit 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse piles and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at underground mines 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of related cash flows  discounted using a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustment for permit changes  the anticipated timing of mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and 
table of contents productivity assumptions to reflect current experience 
as changes in estimates occur  the carrying amount of the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free discount rate 
if our assumptions differ from actual experience  or if changes in the regulatory environment occur  our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors multiple defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans that cover certain us salaried employees and eligible hourly employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
the company considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at the beginning of each fiscal year based on a building block method  which consists of aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan asset mix 
plan assets are comprised primarily of domestic large and mid cap funds  international funds and fixed income investments 
the company uses historic plan asset returns combined with current market factors such as inflation rates and interest rate levels 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change frequently 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit cost was for the year ended december  any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is recorded in other comprehensive income and amortized into expense in future periods 
the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest costs components of the net periodic benefit cost 
in estimating that rate  we use a yield curve approach which matches the expected cash flows to high quality corporate bonds available at the measurement date 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was for and for for the measurement of our year end pension obligation and pension expense for  we used a discount rate of 
key assumptions used in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for other postretirement benefits other than pensions include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate is calculated in the same manner as discussed above for the pension plan 
the discount rate used to calculate the postretirement benefit expense was and for and  respectively 
for the measurement of our year end other postretirement benefits obligation and postretirement expense for  we used a discount rate of 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was for  declining to in and thereafter 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and healthcare plans 
a 
table of contents one percentage point change in the rate for each of these assumptions would have had the following effects as of and for the year ended december  in thousands increase decrease percentage point increase percentage point decrease healthcare cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of modifications are amortized over future periods 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company in determining its pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and future expenses may differ materially from actual results because of changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect the company financial position or results of operations 
workers compensation and black lung we also have significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities  and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims  discount factors  benefit increases and mortality rates 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
for the workers compensation liability  we apply a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of 
table of contents this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the us require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   we had valuation allowances totaling million  primarily for capital and ordinary loss carry forwards not expected to provide future tax benefits 
in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in this evaluation  we may need to record a charge to earnings to reflect the change in our expected valuation of the deferred tax assets 
we are in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues  primarily related to the discontinued homebuilding and financing businesses 
we believe that our tax filing positions have substantial merit and we intend to vigorously defend these positions 
we have established accruals that we believe are sufficient to address claims related to our uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management estimate of this liability could change 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets mineral interests  property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment and  if so  assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded  if any  is equal to the amount by which the asset net book value exceeds its fair market value 
fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  operating budgets  expected growth rates  and cost of capital 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of management control and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
accounting for natural gas exploration activities we apply the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas exploration activities 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  pending determination of a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves attributable to the area as a result of drilling 
if a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves is not discovered  any associated previously capitalized exploration costs associated with the drilling area are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether sufficient proved reserves have been found when drilling of an individual exploratory well has been completed 
such exploratory drilling costs  as well as additional exploratory well costs for the area  may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify the area completion as a producing well or field of production and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic 
table of contents and operating viability of the project is being made 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the cost of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas  are capitalized 
due to challenges in the short term market outlook and the weak backdrop in coal demand experienced in the latter half of the year  during the third quarter the company reviewed its operating strategy and related capital investment projects 
as a result of this review  management decided to indefinitely abandon a natural gas exploration project that was accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
accordingly  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million million after tax to write off the capitalized exploratory costs associated with the natural gas exploration project 
the company had no capitalized exploratory drilling costs as of december  and had approximately million of capitalized exploratory drilling costs as of december  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is to be tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we typically perform our annual goodwill testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level 
in the third quarter of  market and industry trends and a weakened worldwide economy drove prices for our products downward and also had a negative impact on our share price 
we evaluated these events and determined that they represented a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment 
as a result  we conducted our review of goodwill for potential impairments in the third quarter of we test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
we perform our goodwill impairment test in two steps 
step one compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one is higher than its carrying value  we need not perform step two as the asset is deemed not to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one is lower than its carrying value  we proceed to step two  which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
any excess of carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value at a reporting unit is recorded as impairment 
the valuation methodology utilized to estimate the fair value of the reporting units in step one is typically performed using both a market and income approach 
the market approach is typically based on a guideline public company methodology 
under the guideline public company method  certain operating metrics from a selected group of publicly traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the company reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the income approach uses the net discounted future cash flows projected for the reporting unit through the expected life of the unit to estimate fair value 
management evaluates the results of these methodologies to determine which methodology or mix thereof best represents the reporting units fair value 
the valuation methodology utilized to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the underlying assets and liabilities contained within the individual reporting units in step two of the goodwill impairment test is primarily based on an income approach 
the income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  income taxes  capital spending  working capital changes and the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities contained within the individual reporting units 
our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long term outlook of market prices expected to be received for our coal 
if actual coal prices are less than our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities contained within the individual reporting 
table of contents units 
our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts 
if actual costs are higher  it could have a material impact on the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities contained within the individual reporting units 
due to the events previously described  the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july  and recorded impairment charges of billion  eliminating the entire carrying value of goodwill for two reporting units in the us operations segment and two reporting units in the canadian and uk operations segment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk  commodity price risk and foreign currency risks 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates under the credit agreement through our term loan a  term loan b and revolver loans 
the interest rates for the term loan a  term loan b and revolver loans are tied to libor or the canadian dealer offered rate cdor  plus a credit spread ranging from to basis points for the revolver and term loan a and basis points on the term loan b adjusted quarterly based on our total leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   our borrowings under the credit agreement totaled billion 
as of december  a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our yearly expense by approximately million while a basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our yearly interest expense by approximately million due to the minimum libor floor of on our term loan b 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to protect against the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to interest payments required under the credit agreement 
to achieve this objective  we manage a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates and the risk that changing interest rates could have on our operations  during june we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate cap agreement as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate swap agreement has a notional value of million and is based on a fixed rate 
the interest rate cap agreement has a notional value of million and has a strike price of 
commodity risks we are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of natural gas 
our natural gas business sold billion cubic feet of gas during the year ended december  we occasionally utilize derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing natural gas prices 
such derivative instruments are structured as cash flow hedges and not for trading 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in order to reduce the risk associated with natural gas price volatility  on june  we entered into a one year swap contract to hedge million mmbtus of natural gas sales at a price of per mmbtu beginning in july and ending june the swap agreement hedged approximately of natural gas sales from july until june at december   no swap contracts were outstanding 

table of contents foreign currency risks we are exposed to the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily from the canadian dollar and the british pound 
we historically have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to mitigate this risk
