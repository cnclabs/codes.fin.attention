table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended september   september   and september  the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue september  september  september  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges total operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income general during the fiscal year ended september   the following key factors contributed to our overall results of operations  financial position and cash flows increased net revenue by to approximately billion as we continue to experience year over year growth as smartphones continue to displace traditional cellular phones  tablet computing increases in popularity and our product portfolio expands to address additional content within handset  tablet and adjacent vertical markets including medical  automotive  military and industrial 
operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal in absolute terms operating expense increased from million to million primarily in connection with increased research and development expense as a result of increased product development activity 
our effective tax rate for fiscal improved to from in fiscal primarily as a result of a higher percentage of our income being earned and taxed in lower rate foreign jurisdictions 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  overall profitability increased significantly from fiscal with both net income and diluted earnings per share increasing year over year 
our ending cash and cash equivalents balance increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was the result of a increase in cash from operations to million in fiscal due to higher net income and improvements in working capital 
in addition  we invested million to repurchase over million shares of our common stock and million on capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capabilities 

table of contents net revenue fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions net revenue we market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers of communications and electronics products  third party original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we generally experience seasonal peaks during the second half of the calendar year primarily as a result of increased worldwide production of consumer electronics in anticipation of increased holiday sales 
in addition  we periodically enter into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our non core patents or other intellectual property  and we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenue in fiscal increased by million  or  primarily due to the increasing demand for our g  switching  wireless lan and gps solutions 
the increase was partially offset by lower gsm gprs product revenue as a result of the contracting g market 
overall revenue in fiscal increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue was primarily driven by sales of our expanded product portfolio consisting of new products from the acquisitions of advanced analogic technologies inc aati and sige semiconductor  inc sige 
in addition  we benefited from sales of new internally developed products for medical  automotive  military and industrial vertical markets and our increasing addressable content per device as the smartphone upgrade cycle continued to displace traditional g cellular phones 
for information regarding net revenue by geographic region and customer concentration  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
gross profit fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions gross profit of net revenue gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and share based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry 
consistent with trends in the industry  we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline at a normalized rate of five to ten percent per year 
as part of our normal course of business  we mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes  reduce material costs  improve manufacturing efficiencies  lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value added products 
gross profit was million greater for the fiscal year ended september  than gross profit for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher unit volumes  lower overall per unit material and manufacturing costs with an aggregate gross profit benefit of million 
these benefits were partially offset by the erosion of average selling price and unfavorable changes in product mix which combined to negatively impact gross profit by million 
as a result of these impacts  gross profit margin increased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit was million greater for the fiscal year ended september  than gross profit for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was the result of higher unit volumes and lower overall per unit material and manufacturing costs with an aggregate gross profit benefit of million 
these benefits were partially offset by the erosion of average selling price  unfavorable changes in product mix  the impact  of the fair value step up of acquired inventory primarily related to aati and sige and higher share based compensation expense which combined to negatively impact gross profit by million 
as a result of these impacts  gross profit margin decreased to of net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  
table of contents during fiscal and we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
revenue associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property was immaterial to the consolidated results of operations 
research and development fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions research and development of net revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs including share based compensation expense  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  masks  engineering prototypes and design tool costs 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal when compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to a net increase of million related to product design and development activity including the full year impact of aati activities as well as a net increase of million in compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by reductions related to the organizational restructuring initiated during the fiscal year 
research and development expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned increase in net revenue 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal when compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher head count and related compensation  including share based compensation expense  resulting from the acquisition of sige and aati  and to a lesser extent  to increased internal product design and development activity for our target markets 
this resulted in total research and development expense increasing as a percentage of net revenue 
selling  general and administrative fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions selling  general and administrative of net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses include legal and related costs  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  bad debt expense  sales commissions  share based compensation expense  advertising  marketing  costs associated with business combinations completed or contemplated during the period and other costs 
the increase for the fiscal year ended september   was primarily related to increased compensation expense offset by the decrease in aggregated acquisition related and legal expenses incurred in the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the decrease in the aforementioned expenses as well as the increase in net revenue 
the increase for the fiscal year ended september  was primarily the result of incremental headcount and compensation expense including share based compensation related to the acquisitions of aati and sige full year impact  increased acquisition and legal expense of million primarily associated with the acquisition of aati and million in charges related to the resolution of contractual disputes 
these charges were partially offset by a million favorable change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisition of sige 
these factors resulted in selling  general and administrative expenses increasing as a percentage of net revenue 

table of contents amortization of intangibles fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions amortization of intangibles of net revenue amortization expense decreased for the fiscal year ended september  when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior fiscal year due to the end of the estimated useful lives of certain fully amortized intangible assets acquired in prior fiscal years 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal was primarily related to intangible assets recognized in connection with our acquisition of aati in fiscal and the full year impact related to intangibles recognized in the acquisition of sige in fiscal restructuring and other charges fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions restructuring and other charges of net revenue the restructuring and other charges incurred during the fiscal year ended september  relate to severance costs associated with separate organizational restructuring plans initiated during the period 
these actions are largely complete and we do not anticipate incurring any further material charges related to these restructuring plans 
we made cash payments related to these restructuring activities of approximately million during the fiscal year ended september  and expect all cash payments to be completed in fiscal in all material respects 
the increase in restructuring and other charges incurred in fiscal relate primarily to employee and lease terminations to reduce redundancies associated with the acquisition of aati 
for additional information regarding the restructuring activities  see note of item of this annual report on form k 
provision for income taxes fiscal years ended september  change september  change september  dollars in millions provision for income taxes of net revenue income tax expense increased by to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to as compared to in fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate  benefits of related to research and development tax credits  and benefits of related to a domestic production activities deduction partially offset by income tax rate expense impact of related to a change in our tax reserves 
as a result of the enactment of the taxpayer relief act of  which retroactively reinstated and extended the research and development tax credit  million of federal research and development tax credits which were earned in fiscal reduced our tax rate during fiscal we operate under a tax holiday in singapore  which is effective through september  this tax holiday is conditional upon our compliance in meeting certain employment and investment thresholds in singapore 

table of contents the annual effective tax rate for fiscal of was less than the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to benefits of related to foreign earnings taxed at a rate less than the united states federal rate  and benefits of related to a domestic production activities deduction  partially offset by income tax rate expense impact of related to a change in our tax reserves 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended dollars in millions september  september  september  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
for fiscal  we generated million in cash flow from operations  an increase of million when compared to million generated in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the fiscal year ended september  was related to higher net income combined with a net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the effects of non cash amortization of intangibles  depreciation  and share based compensation 
specifically  the changes in operating assets were decreases of million in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer collections and million in inventory 
the changes in operating liabilities were a decrease of million in accounts payable related to the timing of vendor payments and an increase of million in other current and long term liabilities primarily related to changes in tax liabilities and payroll related accruals 
cash flow from investing activities cash flow from investing activities consists of capital expenditures  the sale and maturity of investments and acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
cash flow used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal cash used in investing activities decreased due to the acquisition of aati in the prior fiscal year 
capital expenditures increased to million from million in fiscal due to the purchase of manufacturing equipment to support increased production in anticipation of accelerating demand from key customers at our wafer fabrication facilities located in the united states  our assembly and test facility in mexicali  mexico  and at the manufacturing facilities of one of our suppliers 
our uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal were partially offset by million in proceeds we received upon the sale of an investment during the fiscal year ended september  cash flow from financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash transactions related to debt and equity 
during fiscal  we had net cash outflows of million  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal we had the following significant uses of cash million related to our repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors on november  and july  million related to payroll tax withholdings on vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards  and  million related to the cash payment of a contingent consideration obligation related to an acquisition in a prior year  these uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million and the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million during fiscal liquidity cash and cash equivalent balances were million at september   representing an increase of million from september  the increase resulted from million in cash generated from operations which is partially offset by million used to repurchase million shares of stock and million in capital expenditures for increased production capacity during the fiscal year ended september  based on our historical results of operations  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development  
table of contents capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and our cash from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements 
in addition  any future strategic investments and acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid term deposits with original maturities of days or less and money market funds where the underlying securities primarily consist of united states treasury obligations  united states agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by united states government and agency obligations 
our cash and cash equivalent balance of million at september  consisted of million held domestically and million held by foreign subsidiaries 
of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at september   million is considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated 
the remaining million of foreign cash and cash equivalents can be repatriated without any tax consequences 
off balance sheet arrangements all significant contractual obligations are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulation s k a ii 
contractual cash flows set forth below is a summary of our contractual payment obligations related to our operating leases  other commitments and long term liabilities at september  in millions payments due by period obligation total less than year years years thereafter other long term liabilities operating lease obligations other commitments total other long term liabilities include our gross unrecognized tax benefits  as well as executive deferred compensation  which are both classified as beyond five years due to the uncertain nature of the liabilities 
other commitments consist of contractual license and royalty payments  and other purchase obligations 
see note of item of this annual report on form k critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  business combinations  share based compensation  loss contingencies and income taxes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported  disclosures  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our best judgments 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of item in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition net of estimated reserves 
our revenue reserves contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for price protection and product returns stock rotation for products sold to certain electronic component distributors 
our estimates of the amount and timing of the reserves is based primarily on historical experience and specific contractual arrangements 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated sales reserves and actual results 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established on a quarterly basis and are based on a detailed analysis of forecasted demand in relation to on hand inventory  saleability of our inventory  general market conditions  and product life cycles 
our reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated inventory reserves and actual results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
other long lived assets are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
the impairment evaluation of goodwill involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we use the market price of the company stock adjusted for a market premium to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the possible goodwill impairment loss 
in the second step  if required  we would use a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill would then be compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we would recognize a loss equal to the excess 
our impairment analyses contain uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to items such as estimate control premiums  discount rate  future cash flows  the profitability of future business strategies and useful lives 
business combinations 
we apply significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and the contingent consideration recorded as part of business combinations 
the value of all assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in measuring the fair value  we utilize a number of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions such as projected revenue  royalty rates  weighted average cost of capital  discount rates and estimated useful lives 
these assessments can be significantly affected by our judgments 
share based compensation 
we have a share based compensation plan which includes non qualified stock options  restricted and performance share awards and units  employee stock purchase plan and other special share based awards 
see note of item of this annual report on form k for a detailed listing and complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock options at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant contains assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables including  but not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  risk free rate  and the expected life of the award 
the black scholes value  combined with our estimated forfeiture rate  is used to determine the compensation expense to be recognized over the requisite service period of the options 
for restricted and performance based awards and units  we determine the fair value based on the grant date value of the company stock 
these awards and units are expensed over the requisite service period of the award 
performance based awards and units are valued based on an estimate of the most probable outcome of the underlying performance metric 
management periodically evaluates these assumptions and updates share based compensation expense accordingly 

table of contents loss contingencies 
we record an estimate for loss contingencies such as a legal proceeding or claims if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose material loss contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our loss contingency analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to assess the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of potential loss 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimates and actual results 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
asc income taxes asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods and disclosure 
the application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations  and court rulings 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we feel is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits of the position  to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that we feel are more likely than not to not be realized 
other matters inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the three year period ended september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality investment risk  interest rate risk and exchange rate risk as described below 
investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate and general market risks related principally to our investment portfolio and consisting of the following in millions september  cash and cash equivalents time deposits  certificate of deposits and money market funds available for sale securities auction rate securities at carrying value total the main objectives of our investment activities are the liquidity and preservation of capital 
our cash equivalent investments have short term maturity periods which dampen the impact of market or interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with our investments is not material as our money market and deposits are diversified across several financial institutions with high credit ratings which reduces the amount of credit exposure to any one counter party 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading  speculative or investment purposes  however  we may use derivatives in the future 
based on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september   a hypothetical reduction in the interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents to zero would result in an immaterial reduction of interest income with a de minimis impact to income before taxes 

table of contents we own million of par value auction rate securities which are currently valued at million as of september  in the event that the market conditions change in the future and our auction rate security becomes fully and permanently impaired  the impact to income before income taxes would be the par value of the auction rate security of approximately million as of september  given the low interest rate environment  the objectives of our investment activities  and the relatively low interest income generated from our cash and cash equivalents and other investments  we do not believe that market  investment or interest rate risks pose material exposures to our current business or results of operations 
exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended september   september   and september   the company had foreign exchange losses gains of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
