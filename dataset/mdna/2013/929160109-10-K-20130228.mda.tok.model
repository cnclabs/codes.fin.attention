logo effective land management we believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success 
good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long term planning because mining  ultimately  is an interim use of the land 
therefore  we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post mining land management 
we continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future

index to financial statements product lines we have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines aggregates concrete asphalt mix cement aggregates logo a number of factors affect the us aggregates industry and our business including markets  reserves and demand cycles 
local markets aggregates have a high weight to value ratio and  in most cases  must be produced near where they are used  if not  transportation can cost more than the materials rendering such material uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials 
exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the us gulf coast and the eastern seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates 
we serve these markets from inland quarries shipping by barge and rail and from our quarry on mexico s yucatan peninsula 
we transport aggregates from mexico to the us principally on our three panamax class  self unloading ships 
diverse markets large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private sector construction projects such as highways  airports  water and sewer systems  industrial manufacturing facilities  residential and nonresidential buildings 
aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast 
location and quality of reserves we currently have billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves 
the bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population  jobs and households  which require new infrastructure  housing  offices  schools and other development 
such growth requires aggregates for construction 
zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries 
these restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas  but they also could increase the value of our reserves at existing locations

index to financial statements demand cycles long term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population  jobs and households 
while short and medium term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles  declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries  with each peak establishing a new historical high 
in comparison to all other recent demand cycles  the current downturn has been unusually steep and long  making it difficult to predict the timing or strength of future recovery 
however  there are signs the current cyclical downturn is drawing to a close and a recovery in private construction is taking hold 
residential construction  as measured by housing starts  has bottomed out  and a sustained recovery appears to be underway 
since october  year over year growth in trailing twelve month housing starts has been increasing 
this is significant because housing contributes to gross domestic product gdp in two basic ways through fixed investment and through consumption spending and housing services 
residential investment  which includes construction of both new single family and multi family structures  has the most direct impact on construction activity 
during the last four housing recoveries after economic downturns  increased construction activity in other end markets has followed growth in housing starts 
the diagram below depicts how housing starts can have a direct and indirect impact on the overall economy and construction end markets 
housing starts lead to growth in demand for private investment as well as initial and ongoing sources of tax revenue  both of which drive increased construction activity 
historically  housing has contributed to of gdp  according to the national association of home builders 
logo in addition  the following factors influence the aggregates market highly fragmented industry the us aggregates industry is composed of over  companies that manage almost  operations 
this fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation 
companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities 
relatively stable demand from the public sector publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privately funded construction  and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending 
private construction primarily residential and nonresidential buildings typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publicly funded projects particularly highways  roads and bridges which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles

index to financial statements limited product substitution there are limited substitutes for quality aggregates 
in urban locations  recycled concrete and asphalt have applications as a lower cost alternative to virgin aggregates 
however  many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete or asphalt but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance based criteria for durability  strength and other qualities 
widely used in downstream products in the production process  aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses 
two products that use aggregates as a raw material are asphalt mix and ready mixed concrete 
by weight  aggregates comprise approximately of asphalt mix and of ready mixed concrete 
flexible production capabilities the production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and  through a series of screens  separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used 
production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand 
raw material inputs largely under our control unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries  the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves 
stone  sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources 
however  production does require the use of explosives  hydrocarbon fuels and electric power

index to financial statements our markets we focus on the us markets with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand 
because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates  our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or with access to economical transportation to their markets 
we serve both the public and the private sectors 
public sector public sector construction includes spending by federal  state  and local governments for highways  bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems  water supply systems  dams  reservoirs and other public construction projects 
construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources 
in  publicly funded construction accounted for approximately of our total aggregates shipments 
public sector funding generally  public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi year legislation and programs 
for example  the federal transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects 
for over two decades  a portion of transportation projects has been funded through a series of multi year bills 
the long term aspect of these bills is critical because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long term and complex highway projects 
federal highway spending is governed by multi year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the federal highway trust fund 
this trust fund receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies 
the level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the united states and depends on individual state needs and economies 
in  approximately of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects 
federal highway funding in june  congress passed map  a new multi year highway bill 
there was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation in both the house and the senate  and it was signed into law by the president on july  this bill provides state departments of transportation with the funding certainty to move forward on infrastructure programs  and it helps rebuild america s aging infrastructure by modernizing and reforming our current transportation system  while also protecting millions of jobs 
map maintains essentially level funding for the next two fiscal years  with approximately billion for total funding through fiscal year it extends the highway trust fund and tax collections through fiscal year adding additional stability to the federal highway program 
the bill s substantial highway provisions are more reform focused than previous bills  with a strong emphasis on improving project delivery and eliminating red tape that has slowed the construction of highway projects 
funding directly for highways provides a floor of billion for fiscal years and on top of this  there is a very significant increase in the transportation infrastructure finance innovation act tifia program 
funding for this program will increase to billion over the next two year period from million per year under the previous multi year highway bill known as safetea lu 
tifia funding is typically leveraged by a factor of  so that there is the potential for billion in additional major project funding for fiscal years and the us department of transportation estimates this new tifia funding will support to billion in new construction 
however  given administrative requirements and other factors  it is expected that tifia will not have a meaningful impact on aggregates shipments until and beyond 
tifia is a highly popular program that stimulates private capital investment for projects of national or regional significance in key growth areas throughout the united states  including large portions of our footprint 
the program provides credit assistance in the form of secured loans  loan guarantees and lines of credit to major transportation infrastructure projects 
eligible sponsors for tifia projects include state and local governments  private firms  special authorities and transportation improvement districts 
eligible projects include highways and bridges  large multi modal projects  as well as freight transfer and transit facilities 
we are well positioned in states that are likely to get a disproportionate number of tifia funded projects 
overall  map creates a positive framework for future authorizations through its significant reforms  consolidating and simplifying federal highway programs  accelerating the project delivery process  expanding project financing and promoting public private partnership opportunities 
the fact that congress was able to pass the bill given the political climate in washington  maintaining funding levels while also adding an additional year of program funding beyond what part i

index to financial statements was expected  has its own significance and makes us even more optimistic about the ability of congress to continue to work towards long term solutions that will rebuild america s infrastructure 
private sector the private sector markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and is considerably more cyclical than public construction 
in  privately funded construction accounted for approximately of our total aggregates shipments 
nonresidential construction private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects 
such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction 
overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth  vacancy rates  private infrastructure needs and demographic trends 
the growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices  hotels and restaurants 
likewise  population growth generates demand for stores  shopping centers  warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals  churches and entertainment facilities 
large industrial projects  such as a new manufacturing facility  can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies 
construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm s ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing 
consistent with past cycles of private sector construction  private nonresidential construction activity remained strong after residential construction peaked in contract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggregates 
however  in late  contract awards for private nonresidential buildings peaked 
in  contract awards in the us declined from the prior year and in fell sharply  declining from levels 
however  after bottoming in  trailing twelve month contract awards for private nonresidential buildings began to improve in  ending the year up from levels 
in  private nonresidential building awards grew another  which was entirely attributable to strength in contract awards for stores and office buildings  up and  respectively 
employment growth  more attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market

index to financial statements residential construction the majority of residential construction is for single family houses with the remainder consisting of multi family construction ie  two family houses  apartment buildings and condominiums 
public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand 
household formations in our markets continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the us construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing 
demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of driveways or parking lots 
us housing starts  as measured by mcgraw hill data  peaked in early at over million units annually 
by the end of  total housing starts had declined to less than  units  well below prior historical lows of approximately million units annually 
in  total housing starts increased to  units annually 
the growth in residential construction bodes well for continued recovery in our markets 
logo additional aggregates products and markets we sell aggregates that are used as ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks 
we also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways 
in addition  stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives  fillers and extenders 
coal burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions 
limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime 
our brooksville  florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed  paint  plastics  water treatment and joint compound industries 
this facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the brooksville quarry 
we sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the united states  principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the yucatan peninsula in mexico 
nondomestic sales and long lived assets outside the united states are reported in note segment reporting in
