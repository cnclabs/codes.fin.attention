item  management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
if any of the conditions or events described in the following risk factors were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations or growth prospects could be affected materially and adversely 
in that case  the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  individually or in the aggregate  may also impair our business operations 
risks relating to us a downturn in global economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business 
while the global recovery continues  the pace of recovery remains sluggish and uneven geographically 
downside risks remain  including high unemployment  reduced consumer spending  high deficit spending by governments  turbulent financial markets particularly in the euro area  tighter monetary policies particularly in emerging markets and continuing uncertainty over us fiscal policy  commonly referred to as the fiscal cliff 
although the us congress recently took action to avert certain of the immediate tax concerns associated with the fiscal cliff  it only delayed potential us government spending cuts known as sequestration 
continued uncertainty concerning us fiscal policy is likely to continue to adversely affect global economic activity which may adversely affect demand for our products 
as more fully described under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are currently facing a challenging environment for our products  particularly our industrial materials products  as a result of global economic conditions 
the international monetary fund reported gdp growth figures for at approximately 
we believe that in the graphite electrode markets the capacity utilization rate was approximately in and in while improved compared to levels  these lower capacity utilization rates may continue to be driven by a challenging environment for our customers which would negatively impact demand for our industrial materials products and may adversely affect our results of operations for we are dependent on the global steel industry and also sell products used in the transportation  semiconductor  solar  petrochemical  electronics  and other industries which are susceptible to global and regional economic downturns 
we sell our industrial materials products  which accounted for about of our total net sales in  primarily to the eaf steel production industry 
many of our other products are sold primarily to the electronics  transportation  alternative energy  and oil and gas exploration industries 
these are global basic industries  and they are experiencing various degrees of contraction  growth and consolidation 
customers in these industries are located in every major geographic region 
as a result  our customers are affected by changes in global and regional economic conditions 
this  in turn  affects overall demand and prices for our products sold to these industries 
as a result of changes in economic conditions  demand and pricing for our products sold to these industries has fluctuated and in some cases declined significantly  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
demand for our products sold to these industries may be adversely affected by improvements in our products as well as in the manufacturing operations of customers  which reduce the rate of consumption or use of our products 
our customers  including major steel producers  are experiencing and may continue to experience downturns or financial distress that could adversely impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable or to collect them on a timely basis 
sales volumes and prices of our products sold to these industries are impacted by the supply demand balance as well as overall changes in demand  excess capacity and growth of and consolidation within  the end markets for our products 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  the supply demand balance is affected by factors such as business cycles  rationalization  and increases in capacity and productivity initiatives within our industry and the end 
table of contents markets for our products  and certain of such factors are affected by decisions by us 
changes in the supply demand balance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the steel industry  in particular  has historically been highly cyclical and is affected significantly by general economic conditions 
significant customers for the steel industry include companies in the automotive  construction  appliance  machinery  equipment and transportation industries  all of which continue to be affected by the general economic downturn and the deterioration in financial markets  including severely restricted liquidity and credit availability 
in addition  a continuation of the current difficult economic conditions may lead current or potential customers of our engineered solutions business to delay or reduce technology purchases or slow their adoption of new technologies 
this may result in a continued reduction  or slower rate of recovery  of sales of our engineered solutions products and increased price competition  which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
our indebtedness could limit our financial and operating activities  and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 
as of december   we had approximately million of total indebtedness outstanding  including approximately million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the revolving facility  million of senior notes  and approximately million million due at maturity in of senior subordinated notes 
additionally  at december   we had approximately million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving facility after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 

this substantial amount of indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest  thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes  including our repurchase obligations  limit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  on satisfactory terms or at all  limit our ability to adjust to changing economic  business and competitive conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing  make us more vulnerable to an increase in interests rates  a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions  and make us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings  which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing 
if compliance with our debt obligations under the revolving facility materially limits our financial or operating activities  or hinders our ability to adapt to changing industry conditions  we may lose market share  our revenue may decline and our operating results may be negatively affected 
the terms of the revolving facility and the indenture governing the senior notes include covenants that could restrict or limit our financial and business operations 
the revolving facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that  subject to certain exceptions and qualifications  restrict or limit gti ability and the ability of gti subsidiaries to  among other things incur  repay or refinance indebtedness  
table of contents create liens on or sell our assets  engage in certain fundamental corporate changes or changes to our business activities  make investments or engage in mergers or acquisitions  engage in sale leaseback transactions  pay dividends or repurchase stock  engage in certain affiliate transactions  enter into agreements or otherwise restrict gti subsidiaries from making distributions or paying dividends to the borrowers under the revolving facility  and repay intercompany indebtedness owed to gti or make distributions or pay dividends to gti 
the revolving facility also contains certain affirmative covenants and requires us to comply with financial coverage ratios regarding both our cash interest expense and our senior secured debt relative to our ebitda as defined in the revolving facility 
these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business  and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
additionally  our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the revolving facility and are unable to obtain a waiver  or amendment  an event of default would result  and the lenders could  among other things  declare outstanding amounts due and payable  refuse to lend additional amounts to us  require deposit of cash collateral in respect of outstanding letters of credit  or refuse to waive any restrictive covenants in the revolving facility  including the restriction which prohibits dividends and distributions from gti subsidiaries to gti to fund payment of indebtedness  including the senior notes  during a default or event of default 
if we were unable to repay or pay the amounts due  the lenders could  among other things  proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness  which includes substantially all of the assets of gti and its us subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of gti foreign subsidiaries 
our cash flows may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness  and if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness  we may be required to seek other financing alternatives  which may not be successful 
our ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations  including the senior notes and our obligations under the revolving facility  depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations  which is subject to general economic conditions  competitive pressures and certain financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to make these payments  we may be required to seek additional financing sources  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or operations or refinance our indebtedness 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
in addition  we may not be able to take any of these actions  and  even if successful  these actions may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
our ability to restructure or refinance the debt under the revolving facility will depend on  among other things  the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt  we will be in default and the outstanding principal and interest on our debt could be declared to be due and payable  in which case we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation or required to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or debt obligations 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a variable rate  which subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
all of our borrowings under the revolving facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on this variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same 

table of contents we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control repurchase 
upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event under the indenture governing the senior notes  holders of senior notes may require us to purchase their senior notes 
however  it is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of senior notes 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources  or will be able to arrange financing  to pay the repurchase price in cash with respect to any senior notes tendered by holders for repurchase upon a change of control 
our failure to repurchase the senior notes when required would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes which could  in turn  constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness  if any 
the terms of the revolving facility include covenants that could restrict or limit our ability to repurchase the senior notes in a change of control repurchase event 
upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event under the indenture governing the senior notes  holders of senior notes may require us to purchase their senior notes 
the revolving facility contains a restrictive covenant on the repurchase or retirement of indebtedness  which could limit or restrict our ability to make the required repurchase of senior notes 
if the repurchase of senior notes does violate covenants in the revolving facility and if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  an event of default would occur if we repurchased the senior notes  and the lenders under the revolving facility could  among other things  declare outstanding amounts thereunder due and payable  refuse to lend additional amounts to us  and require a deposit of cash collateral in respect of outstanding letters of credit 
if we were unable to repay or pay the amounts due  the lenders could  among things  proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness  which includes substantially all of the assets of gti and gti us subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of gti foreign subsidiaries 
a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 
any rating assigned to our debt could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in that rating agency judgment  future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating  such as adverse changes  so warrant 
any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  which may continue indefinitely or intensify  could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  or those of our customers and suppliers 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  or those of our customers and suppliers 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our businesses or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments  as well as our ability to effectively hedge our currency or interest rate risks and exposures 
such disruptions may also adversely impact the capital needs of our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we are subject to risks associated with operations in multiple countries 
a substantial majority of our net sales are derived from sales outside the us  and a majority of our operations and our total property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are located outside the us as a result  we are subject to risks associated with operating in multiple countries  including currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  including impacts of transactions in various currencies  impact on translation of various currencies into dollars for us reporting and financial covenant compliance purposes  and impacts on results of operations due to the fact that costs of our foreign subsidiaries are primarily incurred in local currencies while their products are primarily sold in dollars and euros  imposition of or increases in customs duties and other tariffs  imposition of or increases in currency exchange controls  including imposition of or increases in limitations on conversion of various currencies into dollars  euros  or other currencies  making of intercompany loans by subsidiaries or remittance of dividends  interest or principal payments or other payments by subsidiaries  
table of contents imposition of or increases in revenue  income or earnings taxes and withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  imposition of or increases in investment or trade restrictions by the us or by us governments or trade sanctions adopted by the us  inability to definitively determine or satisfy legal requirements  inability to effectively enforce contract or legal rights and inability to obtain complete financial or other information under local legal  judicial  regulatory  disclosure and other systems  and nationalization or expropriation of assets  and other risks which could result from a change in government or government policy  or from other political  social or economic instability 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on us or that we would be able to mitigate such material adverse effects in the future 
in addition to the factors noted above  our results of operations and financial condition are affected by inflation  deflation and stagflation in each country in which we have a manufacturing facility 
we cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  by which we may be able to increase prices for our products 
our ability to grow and compete effectively depends on protecting our intellectual property 
failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect us 
we believe that our intellectual property  consisting primarily of patents and proprietary know how and information  is important to our growth 
failure to protect our intellectual property may result in the loss of the exclusive right to use our technologies 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality and restricted use agreements to protect our intellectual property 
some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application or any such agreement 
patents are subject to complex factual and legal considerations 
accordingly  there can be uncertainty as to the validity  scope and enforceability of any particular patent 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any of the us or foreign patents now or hereafter owned by us  or that third parties have licensed to us or may in the future license to us  will not be circumvented  challenged or invalidated  any of the us or foreign patents that third parties have non exclusively licensed to us  or may non exclusively license to us in the future  will not be licensed to others  or any of the patents for which we have applied or may in the future apply will be issued at all or with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us 
moreover  patents  even if valid  only provide protection for a specified limited duration 
we cannot assure you that agreements designed to protect our proprietary know how and information will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our strategic alliance suppliers and customers  consultants  employees or others will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our relationships with them against us 
in addition  effective patent  trademark and trade secret protection may be limited  unavailable or not applied for in the us or in any of the foreign countries in which we operate 
further  we cannot assure you that the use of our patented technology or proprietary know how or information does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property protection does not protect against technological obsolescence due to developments by others or changes in customer needs 
the protection of our intellectual property rights may be achieved  in part  by prosecuting claims against others whom we believe have misappropriated our technology or have infringed upon our intellectual property rights  as well as by defending against misappropriation or infringement claims brought by others against us 
our involvement in 
table of contents litigation to protect or defend our rights in these areas could result in a significant expense to us  adversely affect the development of sales of the related products  and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
if necessary  we may seek licenses to intellectual property of others 
however  we can give no assurance to you that we will be able to obtain such licenses or that the terms of any such licenses will be acceptable to us 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for its intellectual property that is necessary for us to make or sell any of our products could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or use of processes requiring the use of such intellectual property 
our current and former manufacturing operations are subject to increasingly stringent health  safety and environmental requirements 
we use and generate hazardous substances in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  both the properties on which we currently operate and those on which we have ceased operations are and have been used for industrial purposes 
further  our manufacturing operations involve risks of personal injury or death 
we are subject to increasingly stringent environmental  health and safety laws and regulations relating to our current and former properties  neighboring properties  and our current raw materials  products  and operations 
these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and sometimes require evaluation and registration or the installation of costly pollution control or safety equipment or costly changes in operations to limit pollution or decrease the likelihood of injuries 
it is also possible that the impact of such regulations on our suppliers could affect the availability and cost of our raw materials 
in addition  we may become subject to potential material liabilities for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties  for claims alleging personal injury or property damage resulting from exposure to or releases of hazardous substances  or for personal injury as a result of an unsafe workplace 
further  alleged noncompliance with or stricter enforcement of  or changes in interpretations of  existing laws and regulations  adoption of more stringent new laws and regulations  discovery of previously unknown contamination or imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could be material 
we may face risks related to greenhouse gas emission limitations and climate change 
there is growing scientific  political and public concern that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg are altering the atmosphere in ways that are affecting  and are expected to continue to affect  the global climate 
legislators  regulators and others  as well as many companies  are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions 
ghg emissions are regulated in the european union via an emissions trading scheme ets  otherwise known as a cap and trade program 
in the united states  environmental regulations issued in and require reporting of ghg emissions by defined industries  activities and suppliers  and regulate ghg as a pollutant covered under the new source review  prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v operating permit programs of the clean air act amendments 
it is possible that some form of regulation of ghg emissions will also be forthcoming in other countries in which we operate or market our products 
regulation of ghg emissions could impose additional costs  both direct and indirect  on our business  and on the businesses of our customers and suppliers  such as increased energy and insurance rates  higher taxes  new environmental compliance program expenses  including capital improvements  environmental monitoring  and the purchase of emission credits  and other administrative costs necessary to comply with current requirements and potential future requirements or limitations that may be imposed  as well as other unforeseen or unknown costs 
to the extent that similar requirements and limitations are not imposed globally  such regulation may impact our ability to compete with companies located in countries that do not have such requirements or do not impose such limitations 
the company may also realize a change in competitive position relative to industry peers  changes in prices received for products sold  and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for products produced by the company 
the impact of any future ghg regulatory requirements on our global business will be dependent upon the design of the regulatory schemes that are ultimately adopted and  as a result  we are unable to predict their significance to our operations at this point in time 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company operations are uncertain and will likely be particular to the geographic circumstances 
these physical impacts may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns  shortages of water or other natural resources  changing sea levels  and changing global average temperatures 
for instance  our seadrift facility and our calais facility  are located in geographic areas less than feet above sea level 
as a result  any future rising sea levels could have an adverse impact on their operations and on their suppliers 
due to these uncertainties  any future physical effects of climate change may or may not adversely affect the operations at each of our production facilities  the availability of raw materials  the transportation of our products  the overall costs of conducting our business  and our financial performance 

table of contents we face certain litigation and legal proceedings risks that could harm our business 
we are involved in various product liability  occupational  environmental  and other legal claims  demands  lawsuits and other proceedings arising out of or incidental to the conduct of our business 
the results of these proceedings are difficult to predict 
moreover  many of these proceedings do not specify the relief or amount of damages sought 
therefore  as to a number of the proceedings  we are unable to estimate the possible range of liability that might be incurred should these proceedings be resolved against us 
certain of these matters involve types of claims that  if resolved against us  could give rise to substantial liability  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
we are dependent on supplies of raw materials and energy 
our results of operations could deteriorate if that supply is substantially disrupted for an extended period 
we purchase raw materials and energy from a variety of sources 
in many cases  we purchase them under short term contracts or on the spot market  in each case at fluctuating prices 
the availability and price of raw materials and energy may be subject to curtailment or change due to limitations which may be imposed under new legislation or regulation  supplier allocations to meet demand of other purchasers during periods of shortage or  in the case of energy suppliers  extended cold weather  interruptions or cessations in production by suppliers  and market and other events and conditions 
petroleum and coal products  including decant oil  petroleum coke and pitch  our principal raw materials  and energy  particularly natural gas  have been subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have in the past entered into  and may continue in the future to enter into  derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix a portion of our exposure to certain products 
a substantial increase in raw material or energy prices which cannot be mitigated or passed on to customers or a continued interruption in supply  particularly in the supply of decant oil  petroleum coke or energy  would have a material adverse effect on us 
seadrift could be impacted by a reduction in the availability of low sulfur decant oil or an increase in the pricing of needle coke feedstocks 
seadrift uses low sulfur decant oil in the manufacture of needle coke 
there is no assurance that seadrift will always be able to obtain an adequate quantity of suitable feedstocks or that capital would be available to install equipment to allow for utilization of higher sulfur decant oil  which is more readily available in the united states  in the event that suppliers of lower sulfur decant oil were to become more limited in the future 
seadrift purchases approximately million barrels of low sulfur decant oil annually 
the prices paid by seadrift for such feedstocks are governed by the market for heavy fuel oils  which prices can fluctuate widely for various reasons including  among other things  worldwide oil shortages and cold winter weather 
seadrift needle coke is used in the manufacture of graphite electrodes  the price of which is subject to rigorous industry competition thus restricting seadrift ability to pass through raw material price increases 
we engage in acquisitions and may encounter unexpected difficulties identifying  pricing or integrating these businesses 
we have pursued growth  in part  through strategic acquisitions that are intended to complement or expand our businesses  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
the success of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify  price  finance and complete these transactions 
success will also depend on our ability to integrate the businesses acquired in these transactions 
we may encounter unexpected difficulties in completing and integrating acquisitions with our existing operations  and in managing strategic investments 
furthermore  we may not realize the degree  or timing  of benefits we anticipated when we first entered into a transaction 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents we have significant goodwill on our balance sheet that is sensitive to changes in the market which could result in impairment charges 
our annual impairment test of goodwill was performed in the fourth quarter 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts and assumptions 
the assumptions and estimates used in these valuations incorporated the current and expected economic environment 
our model was based on our internally developed forecast and based on these valuations  the fair value substantially exceeded our net asset value 
in addition  to the quantitative analysis  we have qualitatively assessed our reporting units and we believe that the quantitative analysis supporting the fair value in excess of the carrying value is appropriate 
however  a further deterioration in the global economic environment or in any of the input assumptions in our calculation could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units and result in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill on the balance sheet 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies for further information regarding goodwill 
our results of operations could deteriorate if our manufacturing operations were substantially disrupted for an extended period 
our manufacturing operations are subject to disruption due to extreme weather conditions  floods  hurricanes and tropical storms and similar events  major industrial accidents  cybersecurity attacks  strikes and lockouts  adoption of new laws or regulations  changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in governmental enforcement policies  civil disruption  riots  terrorist attacks  war  and other events 
we cannot assure you that no such events will occur 
if such an event occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans and have had in the past  and may in the future have  foreign currency financial instruments and interest rate swaps and caps 
the related gains and losses have in the past been  and may in the future be  significant 
as part of our cash management  we have non dollar denominated intercompany loans between our subsidiaries 
these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  interest rate swaps and caps to attempt to manage interest rate expense 
we have also in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into  foreign currency financial instruments to attempt to hedge global currency exposures 
we may purchase or sell these financial instruments  and open and close hedges or other positions  at any time 
changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates have in the past resulted  and may in the future result  in significant gains or losses with respect thereto 
these instruments are marked to market monthly and gains and losses thereon are recorded in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
there may be volatility in our results of operations between quarters 
sales of our products fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to such factors as changes in economic conditions  changes in competitive conditions  scheduled plant shutdowns by customers  national vacation practices  changes in customer production schedules in response to seasonal changes in energy costs  weather conditions  strikes and work stoppages at customer plants and changes in customer order patterns including those in response to the announcement of price increases or price adjustments 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  volatility with respect to demand for and prices of our industrial material products  specifically graphite electrodes  both globally and regionally 
we have also experienced volatility with respect to prices of raw materials and energy  and we expect to experience volatility in such prices in the future 
accordingly  results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year 
the graphite and carbon industry is highly competitive 
our market share  net sales or net income could decline due to vigorous price and other competition 
competition in the graphite and carbon products industry other than  generally  with respect to new products is based primarily on price  product differentiation and quality  delivery reliability  and customer service 
electrodes  in particular  are subject to rigorous price competition 
in such a competitive market  changes in market conditions  including customer demand and technological development  could adversely affect our competitiveness  sales and or profitability 

table of contents competition with respect to new products is  and is expected to be  generally based primarily on product innovation  price  performance and cost effectiveness as well as customer service 
competition could prevent implementation of price increases  require price reductions or require increased spending on research and development  marketing and sales that could adversely affect us 
we have significant deferred income tax assets in multiple jurisdictions  and we may not be able to realize any benefits from those assets 
at december  we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved 
our valuation allowance  which is predominantly in the us tax jurisdiction  does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
we are executing current strategies and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
risks relating to our securities gti is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 
gti is a holding company and derives substantially all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries 
since gti operations are conducted through its subsidiaries  its cash flow and its consequent ability to service its indebtedness  including the senior notes  is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to gti or upon the payments of funds by those subsidiaries to gti or the repayment of intercompany indebtedness owed to gti 
gti subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities with trade payables and other liabilities 
in addition to any statutory restrictions  the payment of dividends and the making of distributions and the making of loans and advances to gti by its subsidiaries are subject to contractual restrictions provided in the revolving facility 
in addition  any right gti may have to receive assets of any of its subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization and the consequent right of the holders of the senior notes to participate in those assets is effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiary creditors  including trade creditors 
the senior notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities  including trade payables  of gti subsidiaries that are not  or do not become  guarantors of the senior notes 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by all of gti subsidiaries or any of gti foreign subsidiaries 
the senior notes are therefore structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities  including trade payables  of any non guarantor subsidiary such that  in the event of an insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary  all of such subsidiary creditors including trade creditors and preferred stockholders  if any would be entitled to payment in full out of such subsidiary assets before the holders of the senior notes would be entitled to any payment 
as of december   gti subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes had total liabilities  including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities  of approximately million or of our total liabilities  and total assets excluding intercompany receivables of approximately  million  or of our total assets 
in addition  for the year ended december   our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes generated approximately million  or  of our consolidated revenues and approximately million  or  of our consolidated operating income 
under certain circumstances  subsidiary guarantees may be released 
those subsidiaries that provide guarantees of the senior notes will be released from such guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following the unconditional release or discharge of any guarantee or indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the guarantee of the senior notes by such subsidiary guarantor  
table of contents the sale or other disposition  including by way of merger or consolidation or the sale of its capital stock following which such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the company  or gti exercise of its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described in the indenture applicable to the senior notes 
if any such subsidiary guarantee is released  no holder of the senior notes will have a claim as a creditor against any such subsidiary and the indebtedness and other liabilities  including trade payables and preferred stock  if any  of such subsidiary will be effectively senior to the claim or any holders of the senior notes 
we may incur substantially more debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment with the senior notes  including secured debt  which would increase the risks described herein 
the agreements relating to our debt  including the revolving facility  limit but do not prohibit our ability to incur additional debt  and the amount of debt that we could incur could be substantial 
accordingly  we could incur significant additional debt in the future  including additional debt under the revolving facility 
much of this additional debt could constitute secured debt  to which the senior notes would be effectively subordinated to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt the collateral securing the revolving facility consists of substantially all of the assets of gti and its us subsidiaries and certain assets of certain of gti foreign subsidiaries 
at december   approximately million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving facility after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
in addition  if we form or acquire any subsidiaries in the future  those subsidiaries also could incur debt  which debt would be effectively senior to the senior notes if those subsidiaries are not required to guarantee the senior notes 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
in addition  certain types of liabilities are not considered indebtedness under the revolving facility  and the revolving facility does not impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by the subsidiaries  if any  that might be designated as unrestricted subsidiaries 
additionally  our senior subordinated notes provide that they will be subordinated to certain indebtedness incurred by us so long as  on the date we incur such debt and after giving effect thereto  our leverage ratio as defined therein is below to 
as a result  our senior subordinated notes will not be subordinated to any indebtedness if  as a result of its incurrence  our leverage ratio exceeds to 
in addition  to the extent that we grant a security interest to secure any such indebtedness  our senior subordinated notes must be equally and ratably secured with such indebtedness 
after giving effect to the offering of the senior notes and the use of proceeds therefrom our leverage ratio was below to 
as a result  the senior subordinated notes are subordinated to the senior notes 
in addition  the indenture governing the senior notes provides that neither we  nor any of our subsidiaries  may grant a security interest for the benefit of the holders of the senior subordinated notes unless we or the applicable subsidiary equally and ratably secure the senior notes 
the ability of holders of senior notes to require us to repurchase senior notes as a result of a disposition of substantially all of our assets may be uncertain 
the definition of change of control in the indenture governing the senior notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all  there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law 
accordingly  the ability of a holder of senior notes to require us to repurchase its senior notes as a result of a sale or other disposition of less than all of our assets to another person or group may be uncertain 
if we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness  we may not be able to make payments on the senior notes 
any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness  including a default under the revolving facility  that is not waived by the required lenders  and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness  could prevent us from paying principal  premium  if any  and interest on the senior notes and substantially decrease the market value of the senior notes 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants  including financial and operating covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness including covenants in the revolving facility and the indenture that governs the senior notes  we could 
table of contents be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness  including the revolving facility and the indenture governing the senior notes 
in the event of such default the holders of such indebtedness may be able to cause all of our available cash flow to be used to pay such indebtedness and  in any event  could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  the lenders under the revolving facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder  cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
upon any such bankruptcy filing  we would be stayed from making any ongoing payments on the senior notes  and the holders of the senior notes would not be entitled to receive post petition interest or applicable fees  costs or charges  or any adequate protection under title of the united states code the bankruptcy code 
furthermore  if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced under the bankruptcy code  we could be subject to claims  with respect to any payments made within days prior to commencement of such a case  that we were insolvent at the time any such payments were made and that all or a portion of such payments  which could include repayments of amounts due under the senior notes  might be deemed to constitute a preference  under the bankruptcy code  and that such payments should be voided by the bankruptcy court and recovered from the recipients for the benefit of the entire bankruptcy estate 
also  in the event that we were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case seeking reorganization or other relief under the bankruptcy code  a delay and or substantial reduction in payment under the senior notes may otherwise occur 
if our operating performance declines  we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the revolving facility to avoid being in default 
if we breach our covenants under the revolving facility and seek a waiver  we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders 
if this occurs  we would be in default under the revolving facility  the lenders could exercise their rights  as described above  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
federal and state statutes could allow a court to void the senior notes or any of our subsidiaries guarantees of the senior notes under fraudulent transfer laws and require noteholders to return payments received by us or the subsidiary guarantors to us or the subsidiary guarantors or to fund for the benefit of their respective creditors or subordinate the senior notes or the guarantees to other claims of us or the subsidiary guarantors 
under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws  the senior notes or any of the guarantees thereof could be voided  or claims with respect to the senior notes or any of the guarantees could be subordinated to all other debts of gti or the subsidiary guarantors 
in addition  a bankruptcy court could void ie  cancel any payments by gti or the subsidiary guarantors pursuant to their guarantees and require those payments to be returned to gti or the subsidiary guarantors or to a fund for the benefit of us or their respective creditors  or subordinate the senior notes or the guarantees to other claims of gti or the subsidiary guarantors 
the bankruptcy court might take these actions if it found  among other things  that gti or the applicable subsidiary guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the issuance of the senior notes or the incurrence of its guarantee  and was or was rendered insolvent by such issuance or such incurrence  was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business  intended to incur  or believed that it would incur  obligations beyond its ability to pay as the obligations matured  or was a defendant in an action for money damages  or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it and  in either case  after final judgment  the judgment was unsatisfied 
a court would likely find that gti or a subsidiary guarantor received less than fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the senior notes or its guarantee to the extent that it did not receive direct or indirect substantial benefit from the issuance of the senior notes or the incurrence of the guarantee 
a court could also void the senior notes or any guarantee if it found that gti or the subsidiary guarantor issued the senior notes or incurred the guarantee with actual intent to hinder  delay  or defraud any present or future creditors 
although courts in different jurisdictions measure solvency differently  in general  an entity would be deemed insolvent if the sum of its debts  including contingent 
table of contents and unliquidated debts  exceeds the fair value of its assets or if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay the expected liability on its debts  including contingent and unliquidated debts  as they become due 
we cannot predict what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether any of the issuer or a subsidiary guarantor was insolvent as of the relevant date or whether  regardless of the method of valuation  a court would determine that the subsidiary guarantor was insolvent on that date  or whether a court would determine that the payments thereunder constituted fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds 
if the issuance of the senior notes or the incurrence of the guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer  it could be voided altogether  or it could be subordinated to all other debts of gti or the subsidiary guarantor  as applicable 
in such case  any payment by gti or the applicable subsidiary guarantor pursuant to the senior notes or its guarantee could be required to be returned to us or the applicable subsidiary guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or their respective creditors 
moreover  in such a case a court could subordinate the senior notes or guarantees to other claims of us or the subsidiary guarantor 
if a guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason  holders of the senior notes would cease to have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor based on the guarantee and would be creditors only of gti and any subsidiary guarantor whose guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable 
each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without rendering the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee a fraudulent transfer 
this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided or subordinated under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law 
to the extent that outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock are exercised or other equity awards are granted under our incentive plans  the ownership interests of our other stockholders will be diluted 
we have issued in the past  and expect to issue in the future  stock options  restricted stock units and performance share award units to directors  executive officers and other key employees under our long term equity incentive plan and other benefit plans 
other holders of our common stock may experience dilution upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our common stock  or the issuance of future equity awards  granted under these equity incentive plans 
our stock price may be volatile due to the nature of our business as well as the nature of the securities markets  which could affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation which involves substantial costs and a diversion of those companies management attention and resources 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline or fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including failure of net sales  results of operations or cash flows from operations to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  recording of additional restructuring  impairment or other charges or costs  downward revisions in revenue  earnings or cash flow estimates of securities analysts  downward revisions or announcements that indicate possible downward revisions in the ratings on debt instruments that we may have outstanding from time to time  if any  speculation in the press or investor perception concerning our industry or our prospects  and changes in general capital market conditions

gti is a holding company that derives substantially all of its cash flow from issuances of its securities and the cash flows of its subsidiaries

in addition  this item provides information about our business segments and how the results of those segments impact our financial condition and results of operation as a whole 
executive summary on november   we acquired seadrift and c g 
as a result of these acquisitions  our results of operations and md a analysis for include one month of activity of seadrift and c g  compared to a full year of operations for in february and october  we acquired micron research and fmi  respectively

according to the world steel association and other published reports  global steel production  excluding china  declined percent in steel production in the european union decreased percent during the same period 
as a result  our industrial materials segment saw a decline in sales of  despite increased pricing for graphite electrodes and needle coke products 
our engineered solutions segment saw a continuation of the decline in the solar markets that began in this decline was more than offset  however  by growth in our advanced consumer electronics products line which  along with the incremental revenue from the micron research and fmi acquisitions made in  helped propel this segment to achieve record annual sales

engineered solutions  which includes advanced graphite materials  advanced composite materials  advanced electronics technology  and advanced materials 
reference is made to the information under part i for background information on our businesses  industry and related matters 
global economic conditions and outlook outlook 
we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
our discussions about market data and global economic conditions below are based on published industry accounts and statistics 
based on current international monetary fund imf projections  the estimate for global gdp growth in is  a slight downward revision from imf last projection in october the imf notes that although global economies are expected to recover at a gradual pace  downside risks remain significant 
the imf highlights that recessionary conditions in europe persist and that the euro region continues to pose the largest downside risk to the global outlook 
emerging markets and developing economies are forecast to grow at a rate in  a gradual improvement from according to the world steel association and other published reports  global steel production is expected to increase percent in however  steel customer confidence and profitability remains low due to the continued economic uncertainty  particularly in europe 
overall  we expect higher volumes in our industrial materials segment 
table of contents in due to a restocking of inventory and an improvement in steel production levels across our global customer base 
the graphite electrode market has become increasingly competitive with the addition of approximately  metric tons of capacity coming on line over the past year  of which approximately  metric tons are located in china 
an estimated  metric tons of additional graphite electrode capacity expansions have also been announced  of which approximately  metric tons are located in china  and are projected to be operational in  although several of these announced projects may be postponed 
these new additions have further exacerbated a challenging global graphite electrode industry  which already had excess capacity 
in the needle coke market  additional supply has come on line with the restart of a major asian producer whose operations had been suspended for several months in this producer appears to be currently fully operational  resulting in additional available capacity in the graphite electrode and needle coke capacity additions described above are compounded further by a still recovering global economy and challenging steel market  in which many steel producers continue to struggle to achieve acceptable profitability levels 
the modest improvement in the global economies and our steel end market  while encouraging  is not substantial enough to offset the negative impact of the graphite electrode and needle coke capacity additions 
as a result  these factors are contributing to downward pricing pressure on both graphite electrodes and needle coke for looking forward  we believe that the excess graphite electrode capacity will be partially absorbed over time by growth in eaf steel production 
based on cru international an independent market research firm and other estimates  it is anticipated that approximately million metrics tons of new eaf capacity will come on line over the next five years 
in light of current economic conditions  we are further reducing overhead expense by means of additional rightsizing initiatives  hiring restrictions  suspension of salary merit increases and reductions in travel and other discretionary expenses 
we have also reduced targeted capital expenditures from levels given the difficult operating environment 
in our industrial materials segment  at the mid point of our guidance range  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  million of which will be invested in product innovation to grow our competitive advantages 
in our engineered solutions segment  we plan to invest approximately million  of which million will be growth capital to support increasing demand for products used in the advanced consumer electronics oled led lcd displays  tablets  smartphones  ereaders and energy lithium ion batteries  leds  oil and gas industries 
these investments position our company for future growth and support our target of double digit revenue growth and operating income margin expansion for the segment in on a stand alone basis excluding shared corporate allocations  interest and taxes  we expect the engineered solutions business will generate sufficient cash to fund its capital and other business investments in the diversification that our engineered solutions business provides is expected to partially mitigate the challenging cyclical steel environment that we face 
we anticipate solid top line growth and an improved margin profile in this segment as our engineered solutions product portfolio shifts to higher margin businesses 
the first quarter of however will be negatively impacted by seasonally slower advanced consumer electronics sales and start up costs associated with investments to support future growth 
as a result  operating income for the segment is anticipated to be comparable to the first quarter of for this segment  we expect double digit revenue growth for the full year and operating income margins to be in the range of percent to percent in the second half of we are targeting full year earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other income expense to be in the range of million to million 
we expect that the first quarter will be our weakest  with earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other income expense targeted to be in the range of million to million 
the first quarter of will be negatively impacted by seasonally lower graphite electrode volumes and higher cost inventory due to the carryover of third party needle coke acquired in and higher fixed cost absorption associated with lower graphite electrode utilization rates in the fourth quarter of in the second half of  we expect improved profitability due to higher sales in both business segments and lower costs in our industrial materials segment as we work off higher cost inventory and reflect lower fixed cost per unit of production as operating rates improve 
we expect to exit the year with fourth quarter earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other income expense targeted to be in the range of million to million 
we are targeting cash flow from operations to be in the range of million to million in  as we reduce inventory levels related to the third party wind down agreement and further optimize our seadrift facility 

table of contents finally  we are targeting the effective tax rate to be in the range of percent to percent in as the tax benefit inherent in our operating model is reduced due to a less favorable mix of jurisdictional profitability 
it is important to note  however  that our cash tax rate is estimated to be approximately percentage points lower  or percent to percent  as we effectively utilize foreign tax credits 
in summary  our expectations for are as follows earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other income expense targeted in the range of million to million  overhead expense selling and administrative  and research and development expenses of approximately million  interest expense in the range of million to million  capital expenditures of approximately million to million  depreciation expense of approximately million to million  an effective tax rate in the range of percent to percent  cash flow from operations in the range of million to million  and fully diluted share count of approximately million shares 
our outlook could be significantly affected by  among other things  factors described under item a risk factors and item a forward looking statements in this report

on october   we successfully completed the refinancing of our principal revolving credit facility revolving facility 
borrowers under the revolving facility were graftech finance inc graftech finance and graftech switzerland sa swissco  both wholly owned subsidiaries 
on april   as permitted by section of the october  credit agreement  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to which  on august   graftech luxembourg ii s rl luxembourg holdco replaced swissco as a borrower 
swissco is no longer entitled to borrow loans under the revolving facility although it is entitled to request letters of credit thereunder only for its own use 
the interest rate applicable to the revolving facility is  at graftech s option  either libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our total net leverage ratio and or senior unsecured rating or  in the case of dollar denominated loans  the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from to depending upon such ratio or rating 
the alternate base rate is the highest of i the prime rate announced by jpmorgan chase bank  na  ii the federal fund effective rate plus one half of and iii the london interbank offering rate as adjusted for a one month period plus 
the borrowers pay a per annum fee ranging from to depending on such ratio or rating on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the revolving facility 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a minimum cash interest coverage ratio of to and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of to  subject to adjustment for certain events 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the revolving facility  as applicable 
under the revolving facility we have additional flexibility for investments  capital expenditures  acquisitions and restricted payments and we can issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed million 
we are permitted to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock in an aggregate amount cumulative from october up to million or million  if certain leverage ratio requirements are satisfied  plus  each year  an aggregate amount equal to of the consolidated net income in the prior year 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million under this revolving facility 
on november   in connection with the acquisitions of seadrift and c g  we issued senior subordinated notes for an aggregate total face amount of million 
these senior subordinated notes are non interest bearing and mature in because the senior subordinated notes are non interest bearing  we were required to record them at their present value determined using an interest rate of 
the difference between the face amount of the senior subordinated notes and their present value is recorded as debt discount 
the debt discount will be amortized to income using the interest method  over the life of the senior subordinated notes 
the loan balance  net of unamortized discount  was million at december  and will be million at maturity in during  we entered into a supply chain financing arrangement  as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources  below 
our purchases of inventory under this arrangement were million in and million in on occasion we sell accounts receivable without recourse to a third party 
we did not sell any receivables during or see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
realizability of net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
table of contents at december  we had million of gross deferred income tax assets  of which million required a valuation allowance 
in addition  we had million of gross deferred income tax liabilities 
our valuation allowance means that we do not believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  income tax benefits in each current period will be fully reserved 
our valuation allowance  which is predominately in the us tax jurisdiction  does not affect our ability and intent to utilize the deferred income tax assets as we generate sufficient future profitability 
we are executing current strategies and developing future strategies  to improve sales  reduce costs and improve our capital structure in order to improve us taxable income of the appropriate character to a level sufficient to fully realize these benefits in future years 
customer base we are a global company and sell our products in every major geographic market 
sales of these products to buyers outside the us accounted for about in  in  and in in  three of our ten largest customers were based in the united states  three in europe  and one each in korea  china  africa  and india  however  all are multi national operations 
in  eight of our ten largest customers were purchasers of our industrial materials products 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in results of operations and segment review while there was cautious optimism for the world economy coming into  the global outlook began to deteriorate during the first quarter  with subsequent reductions to global gdp estimates by the imf throughout  as a result of the slower than expected economic recovery and continued uncertainty in the european markets 
according to the world steel association and other published reports  global steel production  excluding china  declined percent in steel production in the european union decreased percent during the same period 
as a result  our industrial materials segment saw a decline in sales of  despite increased pricing for graphite electrodes and needle coke products 
our engineered solutions segment saw a continuation of the decline in the solar markets that began in this decline was more than offset  however  by growth in our advanced consumer electronics products line which  along with the incremental revenue from the micron research and fmi acquisitions made in  helped propel this segment to achieve the highest net sales in our company history 
total steel production in peaked mid year while the latter half of the year saw significant slowdowns 
the world steel association reported fourth quarter total world steel production declined approximately percent versus the third quarter of  with europe accounting for much of this slowdown 
beginning in the third quarter of  there was a significant drop off in solar production which negatively impacted our engineered solutions segment 
for most of  companies across the world demonstrated  to varying degrees  a gradual recovery from the reduced production levels experienced during the global economic downturn 
in we achieved our second highest net sales in our engineered solutions segment in our company s history as demand for our products increased 
the graphite electrode restocking initiative  which began in the second half of continued throughout much of the year in our industrial materials segment 
further  eaf capacity utilization rates increased in on november   we consummated the acquisitions of seadrift  a needle coke manufacturer  and c g  a producer of graphite electrodes and related products  pursuant to the april  agreements and plans of merger  as described further in note  acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consideration paid to the former owners of seadrift and c g aggregated million and consisted of cash  shares of our common stock and senior subordinated notes 
these businesses are now incorporated into our existing industrial materials segment 
with the acquisition of seadrift we added another major product category  needle coke products  to the industrial materials segment 
the analysis below includes the results of operations for seadrift and c g for the month of december pursuant to the seadrift acquisition  we acquired from the equity holders of seadrift the of the equity interests in seadrift that we did not already own 
seadrift is one of the world s largest manufacturers of petroleum based needle coke and owns the world s only known stand alone petroleum based needle coke plant  located in port lavaca  texas 
in addition to calcined needle coke  the plant produces naphtha  gas oil and electricity as by products

net sales for our industrial materials segment decreased to  million in compared to net sales of  million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volumes for both graphite electrodes and needle coke in the face of a difficult economic environment  particularly in european markets 
these volume decreases were partially offset by higher realized prices in compared to the weighted average selling price  excluding currency impacts  of our melter and non melter electrodes for the year ended december  increased approximately as compared to the average price in we continue to focus on maximizing 
table of contents the profitability of our global production platform  however we are experiencing downward pricing pressure on both graphite electrodes and needle coke for net sales for our engineered solutions segment increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in this increase was primarily driven by continued growth in sales of our advanced consumer electronics products and a more favorable product mix  as we continue to penetrate high growth end markets with attractive margin profiles 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in sales of our advanced graphite material products to the solar market 
cost of sales 
during  we experienced decreases in cost of sales of million as a result of lower sales volumes in our industrial materials segment  primarily related to graphite electrodes 
further decreasing cost of sales in was the favorable impact of foreign currency compared to and a reduction in the year over year mtm adjustment of million million in  million in 
the mtm adjustment in both and was driven by a decline in discount rates used in the valuation of net pension and post retirement obligations 
costs of sales in also benefited from the consumption during the first half for of inventories on hand at year end 
that inventory carried lower raw material costs and overhead absorption rates 
the impact of this benefit was partially offset by the flow through of inventory carrying higher raw material costs and absorption rates in the third and fourth quarters of we anticipate that the impact of higher raw material costs and overhead absorption rates will continue to negatively impact our costs into these net decreases in cost of sales for our industrial materials segment were partially offset by higher costs associated with volume increases in our engineered solutions segment 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat a million increase in compared to increases in incentive compensation expense and selling and administrative costs resulting from acquisitions was largely offset by the reduction in pension mark to market charges in compared to the mtm adjustment in both and was driven by a decline in discount rates used in the valuation of net pension and post retirement obligations 
other expense income  net 
during  we received million of insurance reimbursements for claims made related to flood damages incurred at our clarksburg  west virginia facility during additionally  as a result of the remeasurement of intercompany loans and the effect of transaction gains and losses on intercompany activities  there was a million gain during  compared to a million loss during interest expense 
interest expense increased million in as a result of higher debt levels compared to the higher debt levels were incurred to principally support the share repurchase program  capital expenditures and working capital increases 
we expect interest expense in to be approximately million higher than primarily as a result of the issuance of the senior notes during the fourth quarter of segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales

table of contents segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for industrial materials remained flat at in favorable foreign currency impacts decreased operating expenses in compared to  although these decreases were largely offset by the flow through  principally during the second half of  of higher raw material costs and overhead absorption rates in compared to we expect operating expenses in to continue to be negatively impacted by the flow through of higher raw material costs and lower overhead absorption rates as we consume higher cost raw materials inventories remaining on hand 
segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for engineered solutions decreased from in to in operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due primarily to a favorable change in product mix  as advanced composite materials and advanced electronics technologies contributed a larger percentage of overall engineered solutions sales 
provision for income taxes 
the following table summarizes the expense for income taxes in and for the twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands tax benefit expense pretax income effective tax rates our net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million during  primarily related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions from prior years  which had a favorable impact on our effective tax rate 
we also recorded tax credits relating to prior years in support of our research and development efforts of high tech engineered solutions products  which positively impacted the tax rate for the year 
in addition  the year to date effective tax rate differs from the u 
s statutory rate of due to jurisdictional mix of income 
based on forecasted results  we expect an increased effective tax rate in the range of to in as a direct result of the decreased profitability and the resulting jurisdictional mix

net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were 
table of contents in thousands  except per share data and change increase change industrial materials engineered solutions total net sales we experienced higher sales for both of our operating segments in our industrial materials operating segment had increased sales primarily due to the inclusion of seadrift and c g for the full year in  which contributed approximately million of sales in our engineered solutions segment had sales increases  primarily due to increased volumes of electronic thermal management etm products 
our analysis of the percentage change in net sales from to for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table volume price mix currency net change industrial materials engineered solutions net sales 
sales for the industrial materials segment increased significantly in when compared to due to higher graphite electrode sales volume  as well as the inclusion of needle coke products for all of  compared to only one month in partially offsetting this increased demand  the weighted average selling price of our melter and non melter graphite electrodes decreased by approximately  exclusive of currency impacts  in when compared to our engineered solutions segment also saw an increase in volumes  in  coupled with a favorable product mix due to increased etm sales 
due to rising costs  we announced price increases to customers for normal premium grade needle coke and graphite electrodes during these price increases did not have a material impact to results as the majority of our business was booked prior to the announced price increases 
however  these increases should better position us to manage margins and rising costs in cost of sales 
the primary drivers of the increase in cost of sales were increases in shipments of our products of million and in production costs of million and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of million  across both of our segments during when compared to the year over year difference in the mtm adjustment had an unfavorable impact of million million expense in  million expense in 
the cost of sales also included amortization expense related to the technology intangible assets of million  compared to million in this increase was a result of a full year of amortization in compared to only one month in we are parties to contracts with conocophillips through december for the supply of petroleum needle coke  our primary raw material used in the manufacture of graphite electrodes 
the agreements provide for quantities of needle coke which we believe  together with needle coke that we source from seadrift and other sources  are sufficient for our requirements as currently forecast 
these supply agreements also contain customary terms and conditions including annual price negotiations  dispute resolution and termination provisions 
in july  conocophillips announced that its board approved separating its refining and marketing and exploration and production businesses by spinning off the refining and marketing segment to shareholders 
we do not believe that such separation will have an adverse impact on these needle coke supply agreements 
research and development 
research and development expense year over year increased million  driven by the difference in the mtm adjustment impact million expense in  million in selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a result of a higher mtm adjustment in compared to the mtm charge was million more than the amount million in  million in 
the amortization of intangibles increased selling and administrative expense by million year over year  due to a full year of amortization in compared to only one month in we also experienced higher overhead expense due to increases in sales and marketing coverage to support internal growth initiatives during when compared to these increases in selling and administrative costs were offset by a decline in acquisition costs ie  advisory  legal  valuation  other professional fees  etc these acquisition costs represented million of expense in  compared to million in 
table of contents equity in losses earnings of  write down of investment in and gain recorded on acquisition of non consolidated affiliate 
we acquired an interest in seadrift on june   and subsequently acquired the remaining of the equity interests in seadrift on november  as a result of the acquisition of the remaining of the equity interests in seadrift  accounting guidance requires us to re measure the book value of our previously held equity interest at the acquisition date to fair value and recognize the resulting gain in our earnings 
we recorded a million non cash gain in our earnings 
our equity in seadrift earnings for was million 
other income expense 
other income expense was expense of million in  compared to income of million in  due in large part to currency losses of million in  compared to currency gains of million in interest expense 
interest expense increased million in compared to  driven primarily by the amortization of the discount recorded with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
this amortization totaled million in  compared to million in interest incurred on the revolving facility increased in million in as a result of higher debt balances throughout the year 
segment operating income 
corporate expenses are allocated to segments based on each segment s percentage of consolidated sales 
the following table represents our operating income by segment for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands industrial materials engineered solutions total segment operating income the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales for industrial materials and engineered solutions is set forth in the following table operating expenses percentage of sales change industrial materials engineered solutions segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for industrial materials increased three percentage points  which resulted from an increase of million in total operating costs and expenses year over year 
the increase was primarily a result of volume increases including the effect of the additional volume from the acquisitions of million  higher production costs of million  and unfavorable currency exchange of million 
the amortization of intangibles from the acquisitions of seadrift and st 
marys caused million of additional expense in compared to further  the mtm adjustment related to our industrial materials segment  including the allocation of the corporate mtm  increased million in compared to segment operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for engineered solutions increased six percentage point to in when compared to total operating costs and expenses  increased million year over year 
the increase was primarily a result of increases in volume of million  including the acquisitions of emporium and fmi  as well as million in additional costs related to a shift in product mix  driven by increased etm sales 
further  the mtm adjustment related to our engineered solutions segment  including the allocation of the corporate mtm  increased million in compared to provision for income taxes 
the following table summarizes the benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and 
table of contents for the year ended december dollars in thousands tax benefit pretax income effective tax rates the current year effective tax rate differs from the u 
s statutory rate of due to jurisdictional mix of income and changes in the utilization of attributes and related valuation allowances associated with current year income 
we realized an additional income tax benefit of million  primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance for foreign tax credits carryforwards which are expected to be utilized in future years 
in  as a result of our november acquisitions  we were in an overall net deferred tax liability position and released million of valuation allowance which reduced our provision for income taxes 
effects of inflation we incur costs in the us and each of the seven us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility 
in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries 
currency translation and transactions we translate the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes in accordance with fasb asc  foreign currency matters 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
we account for our russian  swiss and mexican subsidiaries using the dollar as the functional currency  as sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
our remaining subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses from non permanent intercompany balances as part of other income expense  net 
significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under effects of changes in currency exchange rates and results of operations 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates when the currencies of non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the us dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the us dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in currencies other than the dollar 
accordingly  when these currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
many of the non us countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic and political changes  which have significantly impacted currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales  cost of sales or net income 
during  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real  the euro  the south african rand and the japanese yen to the us dollar increased by    and  respectively 
during  the average exchange rate of the brazilian real  the euro  the south african rand and the japanese yen to the us dollar decreased by    and  respectively 
for net sales of industrial materials  the impact of these events was a decrease of million in  an increase of million in  and a decrease of million in for the cost of industrial materials  the 
table of contents impact of these events was an increase of million in  an increase of million in and a decrease of million in as part of our cash management  we have intercompany loans between some of our subsidiaries 
these loans are deemed to be temporary and  as a result  remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded as currency gains losses in other income expense  net  on the consolidated statements of income 
we had a net total currency gain of million in  and a net total currency loss of million in and a net currency gain of million in due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and the effect of transaction gains and losses on intercompany activities 
we have in the past and may in the future use various financial instruments to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  as described under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet all of our present needs 
disruptions in the us and international financial markets  however  could adversely affect our liquidity and the cost and availability of financing to us in the future 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  long term debt of million  short term debt of million and stockholder s equity of  million 
we also had million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving facility after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
as a part of our cash management activities  we manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable vendor terms to maximize our free cash at any given time and minimize accounts receivable losses 
our sources of funds have consisted principally of cash flow from operations and debt including our revolving facility 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of capital expenditures  the repurchase of common shares outstanding  cash paid for acquisitions and associated expenses and debt reduction payments and other obligations 
we have a supply chain financing arrangement with a financing party that provides additional working capital liquidity of up to million 
under this arrangement  we essentially assigned our rights to purchase needle coke from a third party supplier to the financing party 
the financing party purchases the product from our supplier under the standard payment terms and then immediately resells it to us under longer payment terms 
the financing party pays the supplier the purchase price for the product and then we pay the financing party 
our payment to the financing party for this needle coke includes a mark up the mark up 
the mark up is subject to quarterly reviews 
in effect  we have a longer period of time to pay the financing party than by purchasing directly from the supplier which helps us maintain a balanced cash conversion cycle between inventory payments and the collection of receivables 
for  the mark up was based on month libor plus a margin of 
we purchased approximately million and million of inventory under this arrangement in and  respectively and incurred a mark up of approximately million during and million during in the event that operating cash flow and the financing of needle coke purchases fail to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business needs  including capital expenditures  any such shortfall would need to be made up by increased borrowings under our revolving facility 
we use cash flow from operations  funds from supply chain financing  and funds available under the revolving facility subject to continued compliance with the financial covenants and representations under the revolving facility as well as cash on hand as our primary sources of liquidity 
the revolving facility is secured  and provides for maximum borrowings of up to million including a letter of credit sub facility of up to million and is subject to certain conditions including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test 
the revolving facility matures in october as of december   we had outstanding borrowings drawn from the revolving facility of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
on october   we amended the revolving facility to permit the issuance and guarantee of the senior notes  as well as to permit us to loan the proceeds of the senior notes to graftech finance and luxembourg holdco so that they can repay amounts outstanding under the revolving facility  and to permit those entities to repay the intercompany loans to us in order to fund payments on the senior notes and certain other indebtedness 
in addition  we amended the revolving facility to permit acquisitions and related intercompany loans to fund such acquisitions in the aggregate amount of million  in addition to those already permitted by the revolving facility and to increase to million the amount of debt we incur under our general debt basket  to the extent we meet certain financial ratios 

table of contents the interest rate applicable to the revolving facility is  at graftech s option  either libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our total net leverage ratio and or senior unsecured rating or  in the case of dollar denominated loans  the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from to depending upon such ratio or rating 
the alternate base rate is the highest of i the prime rate announced by jpmorgan chase bank  na  ii the federal fund effective rate plus of and iii the london interbank offering rate as adjusted for a one month interest period plus 
the borrowers pay a per annum fee ranging from to depending on such ratio or rating on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the revolving facility 
on april   we amended and restated our credit agreement for the sole purpose of reflecting a change in the structure of our european operations and the addition of two new european subsidiaries as parties to the agreement 
the restatement did not otherwise effect any changes to the financial terms or covenants of the revolving facility 
as described above  on october   we amended the credit agreement to permit the issuance of the senior notes  among other things 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained in the revolving facility  as applicable 
these covenants include maintaining a cash minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of to  which are measured based on a rolling average of the prior four quarters 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with these covenants through if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with these covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
as of december   approximately of our debt consists of fixed rate or zero interest rate obligations compared to as of december  long term contractual  commercial and other obligations and commitments

cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
typically  our cash flow fluctuates significantly between quarters due to various factors 
these factors include customer order patterns  fluctuations in working capital requirements  timing of capital expenditures  acquisitions  stock repurchases and other factors 
certain of our obligations could have material impact on our liquidity 
cash flow from operations and from financing activities services payment of our obligations  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
as of december  we had million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving facility after considering financial covenants restrictions and the outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
continued volatility 
table of contents in the global economy may require additional borrowings under our revolving facility  if our supply chain financing arrangement is terminated 
an improving economy  while resulting in improved results of operations  could increase our cash requirements to purchase inventories  make capital expenditures and fund payables and other obligations until increased accounts receivable are converted into cash 
a downturn could significantly negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows  which  coupled with increased borrowings  could negatively impact our credit ratings  our ability to comply with debt covenants  our ability to secure additional financing and the cost of such financing  if available 
based on expected operating results and expected cash flows  we expect to be in compliance with our existing financial covenants in in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduce our sales of  or refuse to sell except for cash on delivery or under letters of credit our products to some customers and potential customers 
in the current economic environment  our customers may experience liquidity shortages or difficulties in obtaining credit  including letters of credit 
our unrecovered trade receivables worldwide have not been material during the last years individually or in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
we manage our capital expenditures taking into account quality  plant reliability  safety  environmental and regulatory requirements  prudent or essential maintenance requirements  global economic conditions  available capital resources  liquidity  long term business strategy and return on invested capital for the relevant expenditures  cost of capital and return on invested capital of the relevant segment and the company as a whole  and other factors 
we focus on growth capital expenditures which exceed our weighted average cost of capital 
we prioritize projects with superior returns  which are often associated with high growth markets 
during through  we limited maintenance capital to essential levels required to sustain our business and support a safe working environment 
likewise  we invested minimal growth capital on a total company basis 
in the case of our engineered solutions portfolio  we spent virtually no growth capital during that time period 
in and  we invested more normal levels of capital to fulfill our maintenance requirements at existing facilities 
we also initiated  at our seadrift and st 
marys facilities  increased maintenance capital expenditures to bring these facilities in line with our quality and safety standards  which resulted in an increase of capital expenditures compared to historic levels 
in  we began to meaningfully invest in our engineered solutions segment  in order to be able to produce new products and technologies that were developed and commercialized by our global r d and commercial teams 
these investments helped propel engineered solutions net sales to a record level of million for further  we believe our investment in engineered solutions positions us for future growth 
for  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million and growth capital expenditures were approximately million  with a majority of the growth capital related to our engineered solutions segment 
for  in our industrial materials segment  at the mid point of our guidance range  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  million of which will be invested in product innovation to grow our competitive advantages 
in our engineered solutions segment  we plan to invest approximately million  of which million will be growth capital to support increasing demand for products used in the advanced consumer electronics oled led lcd displays  tablets  smartphones  ereaders and energy lithium ion batteries  leds  oil and gas industries 
we had positive cash flow from operating activities during  and although the global economic environment experienced significant swings in these periods  our working capital management and cost control initiatives allowed us to remain operating cash flow positive in both times of declining and improving operating results 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million  completing the previously announced share repurchase program of our common stock approved by our board of directors in december on july   our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for up to ten million shares to replace the completed program 
purchases under the new program may take place from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions  as market  industry and economic conditions warrant 
no shares have been purchased through this new repurchase program 
in addition to the programs described above  upon the vesting or payment of stock awards  an employee may elect receipt of the full share amount and either pay the resulting taxes or have shares sold in the open market to cover the tax obligation 
we sometimes elect to purchase these shares rather than have them sold in the open market 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and commitments 
we have not undertaken or been a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements or other commitments including non exchange traded contracts  other than notional amount of foreign exchange and commodity contracts commitments under non cancelable operating leases that  as of december   totaled no more than million in each year and million in the aggregate and as of december  letters of credit outstanding under our revolving facility of million as of december  we are not affiliated with or related to any special purpose entity other than graftech finance  our wholly owned and consolidated finance subsidiary 
cash flows 
the following is a discussion of our cash flow activities years ended december  dollars in millions cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all our activities other than to investing and financing activities 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net income for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  write down of our investment in our non consolidated affiliate  stock based compensation charges  equity in losses of our previously non consolidated affiliate gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of assets and currency gains and losses changes in operating short and long term assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations during  operating cashflow increased by million compared to the operating cash flow of although inventories grew throughout the year  due in part to a contractually obligated purchase of raw materials  the increase in was approximately million lower than the inventory increase in  as we took actions to right size our operations to better align with customer demand 
similarly  our accounts receivable balance grew in  but the amount of the increase was approximately million lower than in the net impact of the changes in working capital operating assets and liabilities  which are discussed in more detail below  include the impact of changes in receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  interest payable  and payments of other current liabilities 
we continue to maximize our operating cash flows by focusing on those working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume  such as accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
in  changes in working capital resulted in a net use of funds of million which was impacted by use of funds of million from the increase in accounts receivable  which was due primarily to increased sales volumes at the end of the period  use of funds for inventories of million primarily due to increased volumes on hand resulting from lower sales volumes driven by reduced demand for our products coupled with contractually obligated raw material purchases  and 
table of contents use of funds of million from a decrease in accounts payable and accruals  primarily tax driven  through normal operations 
in  changes in working capital resulted in a net use of funds of million which was impacted by use of funds of million from the increase in accounts receivable  which was due primarily to anticipated increases in sales volumes  use of funds for inventories of million primarily due to the increased sales volume  and source of funds of million from an increase in accounts payable and accruals  primarily tax driven  through normal operations and inventory purchases 
operating cash flow also included cash outflows of million for contributions to pension and post retirement plans

costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
years ended december  dollars in thousands expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical 
business combinations and goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between goodwill and assets that are depreciated and amortized 
our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable and  when appropriate  include assistance from independent third party appraisal firms 
as a result of our acquisitions of seadrift coke lp and c g electrodes llc  we have a significant amount of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires us to use significant judgment including estimation of future cash flows  which is based upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  determination of our weighted average cost of capital for purposes of establishing discount rate and relevant market data 
our annual impairment test of goodwill was performed as of december  the estimated fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts and assumptions 
the assumptions and estimates used in these valuations incorporated the current and expected economic environment 
our model was based on our internally developed forecast and based on these valuations  the fair value substantially exceeded our net asset value 
in addition  to the quantitative analysis  we have qualitatively assessed our reporting units and we believe that the quantitative analysis supporting the fair value in excess of the carrying value is appropriate 
however  a further deterioration in the global economic environment or in any of the input assumptions in our calculation could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units and result in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill on the balance sheet 

table of contents refer to note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our goodwill impairment testing 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill  our investment in our previously non consolidated affiliate and other intangible assets  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts  including inventory valuations 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit and defined contribution plans and postretirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
excluding the defined contribution plans  accounting for these plans requires assumptions as to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note retirement plans and postretirement benefits of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies by recording an estimated loss when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as incurred 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of the future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over our current technology  significant negative economic or industry trends  changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets  and future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to make the following assessments estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that we include within the consolidated balance sheets  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established if our estimates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of our commercial products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  title has passed  the amount is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
sales are recognized when both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or services have been rendered and fees have been earned in accordance with the contract 
revenue from sales of non commercial products manufactured to customer specifications are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are delivered and 
table of contents accepted by the customer 
sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price 
volume discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in conjunction with the sale of the related products 
changes to estimates are recorded when they become probable 
shipping and handling revenues relating to products sold are included as an increase to revenue 
shipping and handling costs related to products sold are included as an increase to cost of sales 
stock based compensation plans 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date  based on the fair market value of the award and recognized over the requisite service period 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  less required adjustments to reflect dividends paid and expected forfeitures or cancellations of awards throughout the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
our stock option compensation expense calculated under the fair value method  using a black scholes model  is recognized over the vesting period  which ranges between one and three years 
recent accounting pronouncements we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
description of our financing structure we discuss our financing structure in more detail in note long term debt and liquidity of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates 
we  from time to time  routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage these well defined risks 
these transactions relate primarily to financial instruments described below 
since the counterparties to these financial instruments are large commercial banks and similar financial institutions  we do not believe that we are exposed to material counterparty credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from sales made by our subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than local currencies  and investments in and intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  to the extent denominated in currencies other than the dollar 
our exposure to changes in energy commodity prices and commercial energy rates results primarily from the purchase or sale of refined oil products and the purchase of natural gas and electricity for use in our manufacturing operations 
currency rate management 
we enter into foreign currency derivatives from time to time to attempt to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
these foreign currency derivatives  which include  but are not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
the outstanding foreign currency derivatives as of december  and december  represented a net unrealized gain of million and a net unrealized loss of million  respectively 
energy commodity management 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and short duration fixed rate purchase contracts to effectively fix some or all of our natural gas and refined oil product exposure 
the outstanding contracts as of december  and december  represented net unrealized losses of million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest rate risk management 
we periodically implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and the risk in our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
we periodically enter into agreements with financial institutions that are intended to limit  or cap  our exposure to incurrence of additional interest expense due to increases in variable interest rates 
these instruments effectively cap our interest rate exposure 
we currently do not have any such instruments outstanding 
sensitivity analysis 
we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and our commodity derivatives 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
as of december   a appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a corresponding increase of million or a corresponding decrease of million  respectively  in the fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio 
a increase or decrease in the value of the underlying commodity prices that we hedge would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of million as of december  in the fair value of the commodity hedge portfolio 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
we had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by million for the twelve months ended december
