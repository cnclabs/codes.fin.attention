item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank holding companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  the company often relies on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
the company may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  its financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain 
table of contents loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the company may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability of the company to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the company s exposure to environmental liability 
although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review during the loan application process and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to risk from adverse economic conditions 
in  the economic downturn that began in continued to adversely affect our business 
although the economic conditions did not create new types of risks  the company believes it is useful to highlight some of the key events to illustrate how events beyond its control can adversely affect the company 
some of the significant adverse economic conditions relevant to mortgage and related businesses include residential housing values in the united states have stagnated or fallen  and in some highly populated markets values have fallen significantly  the volume of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen  and in some markets volume has fallen significantly  investor demand for mortgage backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply  and for some categories of mortgages disappeared almost entirely  except for conforming loans  which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities  rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen sharply and some mortgage products  with new and more restrictive credit criteria  have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates  making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage  many mortgage borrowers in recent years have obtained adjustable rate products  and as many have adjusted to higher rates  and therefore higher payments  defaults on these types of loans have risen significantly  mortgage related defaults  foreclosures  and personal bankruptcies have risen and it is likely that they will continue at historically high levels in the near future  the united states congress and other governmental bodies have adopted the dodd frank act  which has provisions that increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on mortgage lenders and servicers  and 
table of contents the federal reserve has kept short term interest rates at very low levels  to help ameliorate the impacts of the disruptions in housing and the mortgage industry  which has kept the in the prime lending rates charged by most united states banks very low 
some of the significant actual and potential impacts of those events on one or more of the company s businesses include pressures on our liquidity in the mortgage business as investor demand shrank and the securitization markets diminished or  for some products  disappeared  significant reduction in our ability to create gains on sale of mortgage loans we originate  significant reduction in mortgage origination volume and fees  significant increase in delinquencies in some loan products and markets which are related to mortgages and housing  significant increase in loan loss provision for loans secured by  or directly related to  mortgages and the housing industry  significant increase in costs of servicing mortgages due to increased credit remediation and loss mitigation activity  as well as increased collection and foreclosure activity  the possibility that continued low interest rates will compress our net interest margin  and the possibility that  in  adjustable rate heloc loans that are tied to low prime rates could be drawn more fully and could be pre paid less often so that  in conjunction with falling housing values  the ratio of heloc loan balances to current actual values may weaken which could  in turn  translate into higher loan losses and higher provisioning for future losses within the heloc portfolio 
the economic recovery is fragile at this time  and if monetary and fiscal policy measures fail to have their intended effect  the economy could further weaken  which could increase business risks for the company 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption during the last four years 
despite signs of improvement in the us economy  the economic recovery continues to progress slowly and uncertainly 
consumer confidence remains low  unemployment remains high at for february  and the housing market remains an important downside risk  with prices expected to remain low through much of given the concerns about the us economy  employers have continued to approach hiring with caution  and as a result  unemployment is expected to be  at best  only slightly lower in furthermore  record levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus since have failed to produce the expected level of economic growth 
the company does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets will improve significantly in the near future 
the concern now exists that the future of the recovery is at risk because the economic backdrop is uncertain and unstable 
monetary and fiscal policy measures of the federal government may be insufficient to strengthen the recovery and restore 
table of contents stability to the financial markets 
if efforts to revive the economy fail  the us could face prolonged economic uncertainty  and perhaps a double dip recession or deflation  or both 
a further weakened economy could affect the company in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways  including affecting its borrowers ability to meet their repayment obligations 
it is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist  as well as the possibility that signs of a nascent recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline 
if the economy does weaken in the future  it is uncertain how the company s business would be affected and whether the company would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business 
accordingly  these factors in the us economy could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the profitability of the company depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of mississippi 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of mississippi and the specific local markets in which it operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in east central mississippi 
the local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for the company s products and services  as well as the ability of its customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of its deposit funding sources 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area 
the company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets in which the company operates 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the information under the heading competition in item  business  provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in the company s markets 
the company s industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of the company s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 

table of contents the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the company s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which the company introduces new products and services relative to its competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the company s competitive position  which could adversely affect its growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  and not the economic or other interests of shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of the foregoing  could affect the company or the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the company to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  the company and the bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
if the company fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  its financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the company s failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under its regulatory framework could affect the confidence of its customers in the company  thus compromising the company s competitive position 
in addition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under the company s regulatory framework or well managed under regulatory examination procedures could compromise the company s status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals 
the company is also subject to laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes act and sec regulations 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
the company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  the company s efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention 

table of contents failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and or civil money penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  it cannot assure that such violations will be prevented
