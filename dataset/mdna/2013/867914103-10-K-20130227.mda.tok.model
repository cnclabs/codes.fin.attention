introduction we are one of the nation s largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters is located in atlanta  georgia 
our principal banking subsidiary  suntrust bank  offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in florida  georgia  maryland  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia  and the district of columbia 
within our geographic footprint  we operate under three business segments consumer banking and private wealth management  wholesale banking  and mortgage banking  with the remainder in corporate other 
see note  business segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a description of our business segments and a discussion of the change in our segment reporting structure during in addition to deposit  credit  and trust and investment services offered by the bank  our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking  asset management  securities brokerage  and capital market services 
this md a is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes in item of this form k 
when we refer to suntrust  the company  we  our and us in this narrative  we mean suntrust banks  inc and subsidiaries consolidated 
in the md a  net interest income  net interest margin  and efficiency ratios are presented on an fte basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
additionally  we present certain non us gaap metrics to assist investors in understanding management s view of particular financial measures  as well as  to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation 
reconcilements for all non us gaap measures are provided in tables and executive overview economic and regulatory economic indicators generally improved during after remaining relatively unchanged during during  unemployment declined  consumer confidence improved  and the housing markets began to show some signs of improvement  but remained uneven in their recovery 
the unemployment rate  which was just below at december   continued to decline during  settling at just below at december  consumer confidence improved moderately during  as consumer spending increased amidst improving labor market conditions and subdued consumer price inflation 
however  consumer confidence remained depressed overall when compared to pre recession levels as a result of a continued sluggish economic recovery in the us  continued concerns over the economic health of the european union  and reports of slowing growth in other emerging economies 
while some actions were taken during to ease the european sovereign debt crisis  uncertainty in the direction of the financial markets continues to exist as european consumer confidence continued to decline during the year 
as of december   we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of european countries experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains 
see additional discussion of european debt exposure in other market risk in this md a 
the us housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties  and  while home prices rose modestly during  home values remained under pressure and many borrowers continued to owe more on their mortgage than the current market value of their home 
amidst the somewhat stagnant economic conditions seen during  the federal reserve indicated that highly accommodative monetary policy will remain for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens 
accordingly  it anticipates maintaining key interest rates at exceptionally low levels  at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above and its long term inflation goals are not met 
as a result of employing its monetary policy  the federal reserve continues to maintain large portfolios of us treasury notes and bonds and agency mbs with plans to continue adding treasuries and agency mbs to the portfolio in the federal reserve outlook remains for moderate economic growth over coming quarters  a relatively high unemployment rate  and the expectation of stable longer term inflation 
these monetary policy actions may result in a persistent low interest rate environment that may adversely affect the interest income we earn on loans and investments 
regulatory and financial reform efforts continued during  as regulatory agencies proposed and worked to finalize numerous rules 
these rules covered a wide array of regulatory topics  the most significant of which was the federal reserve and other us banking regulators npr issued during related to capital adequacy rules to implement the bcbs basel iii framework for financial institutions in the us much of the npr was consistent with the bcbs basel iii framework 
however  we have noted some substantial differences from the original framework 
as currently proposed  we believe that our risk weighted assets would increase primarily due to increased risk weightings for residential mortgages  home equity loans  and commercial real estate  resulting in a decline in our capital ratios 
under current rules basel i  our tier common equity ratio was at december  under the proposed rules  we estimate our current basel iii tier common ratio  on a fully phased in basis  would be approximately  which would be in compliance with the proposed requirements 
see the reconcilement of non us gaap measures annual section in this md a for a reconciliation of the current basel i ratio to the proposed basel iii ratio 
the agencies are expected to consider the feedback received during the comment period that ended in october  and draft a final rule  which could take several quarters to complete 
accordingly  the final rule may differ from the current npr 
further  the npr indicates a phase in for the new capital rules with the proposed risk weightings requirement not becoming effective until notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the timing and content of the final rule  our current basel iii tier common ratio estimate that we calculated using our interpretation of the npr assumptions does not include the effect of any mitigating actions we may undertake to offset some of the anticipated impact of the proposed capital changes 
we continue to dedicate the appropriate resources to the implementation of regulatory rules as they become finalized and effective 
see additional discussion in the capital resources section of this md a 
in  the federal reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation largest mortgage loan servicers  including us 
following this review  we and other servicers entered into a consent order with the federal reserve 
we describe the consent order in note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and nonperforming assets in this md a 
the consent order required us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent foreclosure consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during and to identify any errors  misrepresentations or deficiencies  determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury  and prepare a written report detailing the findings 
on january   we  along with nine other mortgage servicers  entered into an acceleration and remediation agreement with the occ and the federal reserve to amend the consent order 
this agreement ends the independent foreclosure review process created by the consent order  replacing it with an accelerated remediation program 
pursuant to the agreement  we will make a cash payment of million to fund lump sum payments to borrowers who faced a foreclosure action on their primary residence between january  and december   and will commit million to affect loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention actions 
the impact of the cash payment is included in our consolidated financial results at december   and we expect that our existing alll or other activities will be sufficient to provide for the loss mitigation or other foreclosure prevention actions 
lump sum payments to borrowers will be administered by an independent agent approved by the federal reserve 
the amount of payment to a borrower will be determined pursuant to a financial remediation framework jointly established by the occ and the federal reserve based on circumstances surrounding the foreclosure activity 
as a result of the agreement  we will no longer be required to incur the consulting and legal costs of the independent third parties providing file review  borrower outreach  and legal services associated with the consent order foreclosure file review 
we continue to work on compliance with remaining aspects of the federal reserve s consent order 
we also continue with settlement discussions with the us and states attorneys general related to mortgage servicing claims as discussed in note  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we have accrued for the anticipated cost of resolving these and other potential claims in our financial results 
capital our capital remained strong at december   as earnings drove our tier common equity ratio to compared to at december  our tier capital and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the decline in total capital from prior year was primarily due to the redemption of trust preferred securities 
in addition to strong earnings  our capital was further strengthened due to the issuance of million of additional preferred stock 
overall  our capital remains strong and well above the requirements to be considered well capitalized according to current and proposed regulatory standards 
see additional discussion of our capital and liquidity position in the capital resources and liquidity risk sections of this md a 
financial performance our core performance continued to steadily improve during and marked a continuation of the momentum that we built during our results in were driven by increased revenue  notably in fee income  and also by ongoing credit improvement 
specifically  the year ended december  included improved net interest income and mortgage origination income  as well as continued favorable trends in loans  deposits  capital  and credit quality 
during the third quarter of  we took strategic actions that significantly impacted net income  improved our risk profile  and strengthened our balance sheet 
the strategic actions included the following the acceleration of the termination of agreements regarding shares owned in coke and the sale and charitable contribution of coke shares resulted in a net pre tax securities gain of billion 
the mortgage repurchase provision of million increased the mortgage repurchase reserve to a level that is expected to cover the estimated losses on pre gse loans sales 
the sale of billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans increased charge offs and the loan loss provision by million and the movement of billion of delinquent and current student loans and billion of delinquent ginnie mae loans to loans held for sale decreased noninterest income by million 
see the discussion of all loan sales during in the loans  allowance for credit losses  and nonperforming assets sections of this md a and note  loans in the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the planned sale of billion of affordable housing investments resulted in a million valuation loss recognized in other noninterest expense 
net income available to common shareholders during the year ended december   was billion  or per average diluted common share  compared to million  or per average diluted common share for the year ended december  the year ended december  was a net loss available to common shareholders of million  or a loss of per average diluted common share 
results in compared to were driven by the strategic actions in noted above  which added approximately million  after tax  to net income available to common shareholders  or per average diluted common share 
earnings were also positively impacted during by improvements in net interest income and mortgage origination income 
additionally  did not include preferred dividends paid to the us treasury  while results included those dividends  as well as a non cash charge related to the accelerated accretion associated with repayment of the us government tarp investment in march to a lesser extent  results were impacted by an improvement in the provision for credit losses of during compared to as credit quality continues to improve  the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods 
also positively impacting earnings in was a reduction in credit related expenses and operating losses  driven by credit quality improvement in we believe these expenses continue to be elevated at current levels and as such  believe that earnings will be positively impacted by further declines as credit quality and the economy continue to improve 
additionally  we expect continued net interest margin compression in due to the continued low interest rate environment  as well as some abatement in the future of mortgage loan refinance activity  which benefited us in we made significant progress in our ppg expense initiative  surpassing the goal of realizing million in annualized savings through this program a year ahead of schedule 
since we began our efforts in mid to drive efficiency improvements through reducing expenses and growing revenues  our core revenue has increased  expenses moderated slightly during the latter part of  and our efficiency ratio has improved 
while the ppg program is complete  we expect to continue our efforts to become a more efficient organization and we continue to focus on revenue and expense initiatives in pursuit of our long term efficiency ratio target of below 
our asset quality metrics improved significantly in  driven in part by the strategic actions executed primarily during the second half of the year specifically designed to improve our risk profile  as well as through improved core credit quality trends 
total npls continued the downward trend that began in  with a decline of from december   driven by npl sales  reduced inflows into nonaccrual  and problem loan resolution efforts 
declines in npls were experienced in all categories  with the largest declines coming from the residential and commercial portfolios  despite some inflows as a result of regulatory guidance issued during the year 
oreo declined compared to the prior year  totaling less than of total assets at december   which was the result of continued disposition of properties once we had clear title  coupled with a moderation of inflows 
our restructured loan portfolio declined compared to december   with decreases in both the nonaccruing and accruing loan populations 
further  the accruing restructured portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with current on principal and interest payments at december  early stage delinquencies  a leading indicator of asset quality  particularly for consumer loans  declined during  both in total and when excluding government guaranteed loan delinquencies 
this decline was a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio as evidenced by declines in certain higher risk loans and strategic loan sales 
at december   the alll ratio was of total loans  a decline of basis points compared to december   due to decreases in the alll primarily as a result of improving core credit quality trends despite the additions to npls during the year related to policy changes 
the provision for loan losses decreased and net charge offs decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  both as a result of improved credit quality 
charge offs declined during the year despite charge off increases related to the strategic loan sales and policy changes 
see additional discussion of the policy changes and credit and asset quality in the loans  allowance for credit losses  nonperforming assets  and restructured loans  sections of this md a 
average loans increased during compared to  led by an increase in commercial and industrial loans 
additionally  the acquisition of guaranteed residential mortgage and guaranteed student loan portfolios late in drove significant increases in these loan categories 
we also experienced increases in all consumer loan categories and non guaranteed residential mortgages 
partially offsetting these increases during the year were intentional declines in commercial and residential construction loans  home equity loans  and commercial real estate loans as we managed these loan categories down to further strengthen our balance sheet 
while average loans were higher during compared to  at december   our total loan portfolio was down compared to december  the driver of this decline was our decision to sell certain loans  primarily during the second half of the year 
declines in guaranteed residential mortgages and guaranteed student loans drove the decline in these loan categories and were primarily the result of loan sales 
the sales of government guaranteed loans during caused a decline in the percentage of our loan portfolio that is government guaranteed to at december  compared to at december  this decline was not unexpected  as we made a decision to grow government guaranteed loans over the past several years as a transition to a time of organic loan growth 
as progressed  we experienced increased organic loan growth and a continued decline in our higher risk loan balances  which influenced our decision to sell certain guaranteed loans 
these sales reduced the size of our government guaranteed portfolio to a level more consistent with our longer term balance sheet targets 
we remain committed to providing financing and fulfilling the credit needs in the communities that we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers 
to that end  during  we extended approximately billion in new loan originations  commitments  and renewals of commercial  residential  and consumer loans to our clients  an increase of over from deposits remained at record highs during  and the shift in deposit mix seen during to lower cost deposits continued 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased during the year ended december   compared to the same period in the driver was an average balance increase of in noninterest bearing ddas 
partially offsetting the noninterest bearing increase was a decline in higher cost time deposits of due to maturities of cds 
this continued shift within deposit products  together with a reduction in deposit rates paid  has helped to mitigate some of the industry wide rate pressure on asset yields 
while a portion of the low cost deposit growth is likely attributable to clients desires for having increased liquidity  we continue to believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our consumer and wholesale businesses as we expanded the number of primary client relationships during due to the growth seen in core deposits  our liquidity has been enhanced  enabling us to reduce our higher cost wholesale funding sources  primarily long term debt  which we reduced  on average  by compared to the year ended december  see additional discussions in the net interest margin and borrowings sections of this md a 
total revenue  on an fte basis  increased during  driven by securities gains realized on the sale of our coke common stock and  to a lesser extent  a modest increase in net interest income and a significant increase in mortgage related income 
net interest income  on an fte basis  increased compared to  primarily as a result of higher loan balances  lower interest bearing liability balances and funding costs  and an improved funding mix 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to during the decline in margin was a result of lower yielding loans  a decline in securities afs yields  the elimination of the coke dividend due to the sale and contribution of our coke stock during  and a decline in our swap related income related to maturing commercial loan swaps  partially offset by the redemption of billion of higher cost trust preferred securities  the maturity of higher cost cds  and the continued favorable shift in deposit mix to lower cost accounts 
noninterest income increased compared to  driven by the gains realized on the sale of our coke common stock 
additionally  an improvement in mortgage origination income was driven by the low interest rate environment and expanded refinancing programs announced by the us government  which resulted in a increase in production volume during the year 
the increases in noninterest income were partially offset by an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and  to a lesser extent  declines in card fees and other income 
the mortgage repurchase provision increased million during compared to  as a result of information received during from the gses  as well as our recent experience related to demands  that enhanced our ability to estimate losses of remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre gses loan sales 
card fees were lower in compared to due to the regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective in other income was lower due to losses related to the transfer and sale of guaranteed student and mortgage loans during noninterest expense increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher personnel costs and increased outside processing expenses 
the increase in personnel costs was due to higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance  and outside processing expenses increased largely due to increased outsourced processing services 
operating losses and regulatory fees declined reflecting our improved risk profile 
see additional discussion of our financial performance in the consolidated financial results section of this md a 
line of business highlights during  we changed our reporting segments and now measure business activities based on three business segments consumer banking and private wealth management  wholesale banking  and mortgage banking  with the remainder in corporate other 
during the year ended december   our core performance improved in each line of business compared to the year ended december  in consumer banking and private wealth management  we had solid consumer loan production growth  with year to date volume higher than in favorable deposit trends also continued  as we generated average dda growth of during from a revenue perspective  our consumer business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds  however  we experienced a moderate increase in net interest income 
during  we observed that clients were increasingly utilizing self service channels  which has enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness  while maintaining high service levels 
wholesale banking continued to deliver strong results  with net income more than double what it was in significant growth in capital markets fees  coupled with higher net interest income as a result of increases in average loans and deposits drove record revenue of billion  higher during compared to also aiding net income growth was a decline of in noninterest expenses in  which helped to drive our efficiency ratio below 
mortgage banking reported a net loss in  primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve  the impacts from the mortgage npl and government guaranteed loan sales  and other legacy related costs  however  core trends continued to markedly improve 
mortgage production volume was higher compared to this increase in volume  combined with margin expansion  led to improved mortgage origination income  which was million higher during  more than a increase from the increase in mortgage origination income  in turn  drove a increase in total revenue during it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression going forward as we expect gain on sale margins to compress and refinance activity to abate over the course of while the elevated levels of refinance activity have been beneficial during  we are also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity  which was of production  as we think it will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when refinance volume moderates 
additionally  we are also focused on building out delivery channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize our longer term return profile for the mortgage banking segment

net interest income margin net interest income  on an fte basis  was billion during  an increase of million  or  from the increase was predominantly driven by higher average loan balances  lower average interest bearing liability balances  and continued favorable trends in the deposit mix that included declines in higher cost time deposits 
these variances were partially offset by lower average securities afs  lower loan yields  partially driven by a decline in our commercial loan swap income  and the elimination of the quarterly coke stock dividend in the third quarter of net interest margin decreased by basis points to compared to during the decrease was primarily a result of an increase in average earning assets at marginally lower yields  the decline in our swap income  and the foregone coke dividend income  partially offset by lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the redemptions of the higher cost trust preferred securities 
yields on earning assets declined by basis points to during  compared to during  as loans added during the year yielded less than maturing loans  reflecting the current low interest rate environment 
additionally  loan yields during were impacted by a decline in income derived from interest rate swaps utilized to manage interest rate risk 
in the first quarter of  we expect a modest reduction to net interest income as a result of our smaller balance sheet due to loan sales completed during the fourth quarter of furthermore  we anticipate a modest reduction in the net interest margin in the first quarter of  driven by additional reductions in asset yields  which we expect will partially be offset by lower liability costs 
average earning assets increased by billion  or  compared to the increase was predominantly due to the growth in average loans  which increased by billion  or 
average lhfs increased billion  or  as a result of the transfer of billion of lhfi to lhfs during the year and higher closed mortgage loan volume 
partially offsetting the increases in average loans was a billion  or  decrease in our average securities afs portfolio  which was the result of prepayments  maturities  and principal repayments 
the increase in average loans was predominantly a result of growth in commercial and industrial loans  primarily driven by our large corporate and middle market borrowers  government guaranteed student loans  guaranteed residential mortgages  consumer indirect loans  high credit quality nonguaranteed residential mortgages  and other direct consumer loans 
these increases were partially offset by declines in nonaccrual loans  home equity products  commercial real estate loans  and commercial construction loans 
the declines in home equity  commercial real estate  and commercial construction loans predominantly resulted from our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these higher risk loans 
our loan portfolio yielded during  down basis points from the yield decline was primarily driven by the low interest rate environment and the lower swap related income impacting commercial loan yields 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
the largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates  based on libor  to fixed rates 
as of december   the outstanding notional balance of active swaps was billion  which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans  compared to billion as of december  in addition to the income recognized from currently outstanding swaps  we also continue to recognize interest income over the original hedge period resulting from terminated or de designated swaps in a gain position that were previously designated as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans 
swap income declined to million during from million during the million decline was primarily due to a decline in the income from billion of previously terminated swaps that reached their original maturity date in april of as we manage our interest rate risk we may purchase and or terminate additional interest rate swaps 
in the absence of additions or terminations  our notional balance of active swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of with remaining maturities through early the average maturity of our active swap notional balances at december  was years 
the commercial loan swaps have a fixed rate of interest that is received  while the rate paid is based on libor 
estimated quarterly income of these swaps based on current expectations of future libor rates is as follows ending notional balances of active swaps in billions estimated income related to swaps in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as of and for the year ended december  average interest bearing liabilities decreased by billion  or  from  predominantly as a result of a billion  or  decrease in higher cost consumer and commercial time deposits  a billion  or  reduction in long term debt  and a billion  or  decrease in money market accounts  partially offset by increases in other short term borrowings and lower cost client deposits 
total average consumer and commercial deposits increased by billion  or  during  compared to the same period during this increase was predominantly driven by a billion  or  increase in demand deposits  partially offset by the aforementioned decline in higher cost time deposits  which was driven by the maturity of a large population of higher cost cds 
as of december   we expect approximately billion of cds to mature during the growth in lower cost deposits was the result of successful sales efforts and clients increased preference for more liquid products 
the increase in other short term borrowings was a result of new fhlb borrowings during  which reflects a continuation of the recent trend toward a more normalized funding distribution 
the driver of the decline in long term debt was primarily attributable to the redemption of billion of higher cost trust preferred securities during the third quarter of  which had a weighted average rate of approximately 
the interest rate environment allowed for ongoing active management of interest bearing liabilities during  the result of which was a decrease of basis points on rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during the year 
this decrease was primarily due to an basis point decline in rates paid on long term debt  as well as a basis point decline in rates paid on consumer and commercial deposits  as we improved our funding mix by replacing higher cost time deposits and long term debt with lower cost deposits and wholesale funding 
during  the interest rate environment was characterized by a flatter yield curve versus  as rates at the long end of the curve declined 
more specifically  during  benchmark rates were as follows compared to  one month libor averaged  an increase of basis point  three month libor averaged  an increase of basis points  five year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points  and ten year swaps averaged  a decrease of basis points

mortgage production related income for was million  up million  from the prior year due to an increase in mortgage production and gain on sale margins  partially offset by a higher mortgage repurchase provision 
loan production volume increased billion  or  from prior year to billion resulting in higher fee income and gains on sale 
mortgage production during was comprised of approximately in refinance activity and increased in part due to the harp program 
the harp program contributed approximately to the total production activity for over the course of we expect gain on sale margins to compress and refinance activity to abate 
while we believe that many clients can still benefit from refinancing  the home purchase market is showing improvement and we are continuing to devote resources to home purchase activity to position us for the longer term 
the mortgage repurchase provision for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the reserve for mortgage repurchases was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase was the result of information received from the gses  as well as our recent experience related to full file requests and repurchase demands  which enhanced our ability to estimate losses attributable to the remaining expected demands on foreclosed and currently delinquent pre gse loan sales 
these vintage loans have comprised the vast majority of mortgage repurchase losses to date 
consequently  future mortgage repurchase provisions are expected to decline substantially from levels  and we expect the reserve to decline as losses are realized 
for additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve  see note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and the critical accounting policies section in this md a 
mortgage servicing related income increased by million  or  compared to the increase was primarily driven by a million harp related mortgage servicing rights write down recognized in the prior year  partially offset by lower servicing fees during as of december   the servicing portfolio was billion compared to billion at december  investment banking income increased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher bond and equity originations fee income and m a advisory fees 
card fees decreased by million  or  compared to the decline was primarily a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  partially offset by an increase in certain credit card interchange income 
the estimated impact on interchange revenue as a result of the debit card interchange rules is consistent with our expectations of a reduction in interchange revenue of approximately million per quarter when compared with interchange revenue prior to the regulations becoming effective and before implementation of any actions to mitigate some of the lost revenue 
as a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue  we introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients needs and which we expect will provide additional sources of fee income 
additionally  we also expect continued benefits from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs  actions taken to reduce the costs related to our debit card operational support  and the introduction of other value added deposit product features over the next two years  which we expect will produce additional deposit fee income 
we believed that these mitigating actions  among others  would assist in recapturing of the lost revenue as a result of recent changes in regulations  including those on overdraft fees regulation e and the new interchange fee rules 
inherent in this assumption was client acceptance of certain deposit related fees for value added services we provide 
since the regulations went into effect  we have experienced a lesser rate of acceptance than originally assumed on certain deposit related fees  and clients have changed their behavior to a greater extent than anticipated  including maintaining higher balances in their deposit accounts to avoid certain fees 
as a result  we believe the recapture of lost revenue from the recent changes in regulations will be less than our original estimate and may take longer to achieve than originally planned 
going forward  excluding any effect of additional client acceptance of certain deposit related fees  potential increases in debit card usage by clients  or other mitigating actions we may take  our interchange revenue is expected to be consistent with results seen during other noninterest income declined million  or  in  compared to the prior year primarily due to million of net losses  relating to sales of government guaranteed mortgage loans 
trading income decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease was primarily due to mark to market losses on fair value debt and index linked cds compared to gains in and lower valuation gains related to illiquid securities  partially offset by higher core trading income and a reduction in trading related litigation reserves 
other charges and fees decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower debit card fee income  lower insurance premium income due to the termination of reinsurance agreements with mortgage insurance companies  and lower letter of credit fee income  partially offset by higher loan commitment fees

the increases were partially offset by a decline in operating losses  credit and collection services  regulatory assessments  and other real estate expense 
personnel expenses increased by million  or  compared to the increase was driven by a million  or  increase in employee compensation expense related to higher compensation from improved business performance and modest annual merit increases 
these increases were offset by a reduction of approximately  full time equivalent employees during the million  or  increase in employee benefits was largely driven by a million gain related to curtailment of our pension plan net of a discretionary k contribution recognized in  partially offset by higher discretionary k contributions in outside processing and software expenses increased million  or  compared to the increase was largely due to increased outsourced services  application hosting costs  and software maintenance charges as we transition more processing from internal to external parties 
operating losses decreased million  or  compared to the decline was driven by the recognition in of a million liability related to the potential national mortgage servicing settlement and other declines during in litigation related expenses that tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters  partially offset by a million accrual in as part of the acceleration and remediation agreement related to the consent order 
credit and collection services expense decreased million  or  compared to approximately two thirds of the reduction was related to lower costs associated with servicing mortgage loans 
mortgage related expenses declined due to improved asset quality in both the owned and serviced for others portfolios 
regulatory assessments decreased million  or  compared to the decrease in was due to a lower fdic assessment rate  which reflects a lower risk profile  and a change in the assessment base that took effect in consulting and legal expenses increased million  or  compared to the increase was attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives and costs to address the mortgage servicing consent order 
as a result of the acceleration and remediation agreement related to the consent order that was entered into in january  we will no longer be required to incur the consulting and legal costs of the independent third parties providing file review  borrower outreach  and legal services associated with the consent order foreclosure file review 
the consulting and legal costs associated with the foreclosure file review have been approximately million to million per quarter  and are expected to decline significantly beginning in the first quarter of however  we continue to incur regulatory required consulting and legal costs 
for example  we may incur additional consulting and legal costs in the future associated with new regulatory requirements related to consent order remediation activities  national servicing settlement monitoring and oversight  and cfpb directives 
for additional information regarding the consent order  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and the nonperforming assets section of this md a 
other real estate expense decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was predominantly due to a decline in the oreo inventory resulting in lower loss provisioning  combined with a decrease in losses on sales of owned properties 
over time  as the economic environment improves  we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve  but will likely remain elevated compared with the levels realized prior to the economic recession 
affordable housing impairment increased million compared to  driven by a million write down recognized in the third quarter of  upon the decision to market certain affordable housing investments for sale 
one of these consolidated affordable housing properties was sold as of december  at an immaterial gain 
for the remaining billion of properties  marketing efforts continue as scheduled  and it is anticipated that the properties will be sold in there was no additional valuation adjustment required in the fourth quarter of net loss on debt extinguishment increased by million compared to  due to the million non cash charges associated with the redemption of higher cost trust preferred securities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes

for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the provision for income taxes differs from the provision using statutory rates primarily due to favorable permanent tax items such as income from lending to tax exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities 
the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was primarily due to higher pre tax earnings

loans our disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the related credit reserves describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio  provide information on how we analyze and assess credit risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate alll  and explain the changes in the alll and reasons for those changes 
we disclose our loan portfolio by segment and or by type of loan  which is the level at which we develop and document our method for determining our alll 
loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments 
our current loan portfolio segments were defined in in conjunction with adopting newly issued accounting guidance  therefore  we adjusted loan classifications to align with post adoption loan classifications but were not able to conform loan classifications 
sec regulations require us  in some instances  to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant  in which case we have provided the pre adoption loan classifications 
we report our loan portfolio in three segments commercial  residential  and consumer 
loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower  collateral  and or our underlying credit management processes 
additionally  within each segment  we have identified loan types  which further disaggregate loans based upon common risk characteristics 
the commercial and industrial loan type includes loans secured by owner occupied properties  corporate credit cards  and other wholesale lending activities 
commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation  refinance  or sale of the underlying real estate 
commercial and construction loans secured by owner occupied properties are classified as commercial and industrial loans  as the primary source of loan repayment for owner occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations 
residential mortgages consist of loans secured by family homes  mostly prime first lien loans  both guaranteed and nonguaranteed 
residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction to perm loans 
home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or second lien position 
at december   of our home equity products were in a first lien position and were in a second lien position 
for home equity products in a second lien position  we service of the loans that are senior to the home equity product 
only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing during  with of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in or later and over in or later 
it should be noted that a majority of accounts historically have not converted to amortizing 
based on historical trends  within months of the end of their draw period  approximately of accounts  and approximately of accounts with a balance  closed or refinanced before or soon after converting 
we perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure 
these activities result in the suspension of available credit of most home equity second lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent  including when the second lien is still current 
in  we initiated the monitoring of delinquency status of first mortgages serviced by other parties 
additionally  we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores of borrowers with second liens  as these scores are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency 
at december   our home equity second lien loss severity was approximately 
based on guidance from our primary federal banking regulator in  we elected to revise our credit policy related to the nonaccrual status of performing second lien loans and began classifying performing home equity lines  loans  and mortgages that are subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans as npls 
at december   million of performing second lien loans outstanding were classified as npls 
our methodology for calculating the alll considers the financial condition of the borrower  either through the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or through the regular refreshing of fico scores  which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies 
therefore  this change in policy did not have a material impact on the alll 
additionally  we implemented a change to our credit policy to recognize charge offs of second lien home equity loans  lines  and mortgages at days past due based on a recent analysis indicating that a vast majority of these loans are ultimately charged off 
previously these charge offs were recognized at days past due 
this change in policy resulted in million of incremental charge offs during the third quarter of when the change in policy was adopted 
during the fourth quarter of  we also changed our policy with respect to residential loans discharged in chapter bankruptcy that remained current but have not been reaffirmed by the borrower 
this change in policy was in response to recent regulatory guidance 
as a result of the policy change  we began classifying the discharged chapter loans as nonaccruing tdrs regardless of the loans actual payment history and expected performance and recognized million in charge offs to record the loans at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
we identified and reclassified an incremental million of residential real estate loans to nonaccrual  of which million were newly designated as tdrs 
additionally  million in existing nonaccrual chapter loans were newly designated as tdrs 
prior to december   our policy was to classify loans to borrowers who had filed for bankruptcy as nonaccrual when such loans became days past due 
however  we did not previously report chapter loans as tdrs unless the loans were otherwise modified under one of our loss mitigation programs 
the loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans  other direct consisting primarily of direct auto loans  loans secured by negotiable collateral  and private student loans  indirect consisting of loans secured by automobiles  marine  or recreational vehicles  and consumer credit cards 
the composition of our loan portfolio at december is shown in the following table loan portfolio by types of loans post adoption table dollars in millions commercial loans commercial industrial commercial real estate commercial construction total commercial loans residential loans residential mortgages guaranteed residential mortgages nonguaranteed home equity products residential construction total residential loans consumer loans guaranteed student loans other direct indirect credit cards total consumer loans lhfi lhfs includes million  million  million  and million of loans carried at fair value at december     and  respectively 
loans held for investment lhfi remained relatively flat during  although  the composition of our loan portfolio shifted 
we continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy  as we were successful in both growing targeted commercial and consumer balances and in reducing our exposure to certain higher risk residential and construction loans 
continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios resulted in a combined million decline in these portfolios during and an billion decrease since the end of  which has driven a significant improvement in our risk profile 
also contributing to this shift in loan portfolio composition were the sales of billion  net of million in write downs  in government guaranteed mortgages and student loans 
average loans during totaled billion while period end loans totaled billion at december   which was attributable to the sales and transfers of loans to lhfs during the year 
see the net interest income margin section of this md a for more information regarding average loan balances 
commercial loans increased billion  or  during from december  growth was driven by commercial and industrial loans encompassing a diverse array of large corporate and middle market borrowers 
this increase in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans 
commercial real estate loans declined million  or  from december  the majority of the decline in this portfolio was due to continued runoff  resolution of problem loans  and the sale of million of commercial real estate npls  net of charge offs  during these decreases were partially offset by progress made in increasing targeted commercial real estate loan production during  where we anticipate seeing some portfolio growth in coming quarters 
commercial construction loans decreased million  or  from december   primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by reducing existing construction exposure 
given the stresses in the commercial real estate market  we continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans 
at least annually and more frequently if credit quality deteriorates  we perform a thorough liquidity and contingency analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default by providing a thorough view of borrowers capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations 
we also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification 
due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started  the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding 
we believe that our investor owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower  geography  and property type 
we typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial mbs guidelines 
where appropriate  we have taken prudent actions with our clients to strengthen our credit position 
these actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the client s financial ability to perform 
impaired loans are assessed relative to the client s and guarantor s  if any  ability to service the debt  the loan terms  and the value of the property 
these factors are taken into consideration when formulating our alll through our credit risk rating and or specific reserving processes 
residential loans declined during we experienced declines across all residential loan classes except nonguaranteed residential mortgages  which increased million  or  during  despite the sale of million  net of million in charge offs  of nonperforming mortgages 
the overall increase in our nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio was a result of the low interest rate environment generating new loan demand and greater origination volume  net of payoffs  offsetting much of the declines in the remaining residential classes 
nonguaranteed residential mortgage loan growth came predominantly from borrowers with high fico scores ie  or above and lower ltv ratios 
conversely  government guaranteed residential mortgages decreased billion  or  during  due to the sale of approximately billion of guaranteed residential mortgages  net of write downs  and higher levels of refinancing and loan paydowns 
our election to sell a portion of this guaranteed portfolio was part of our continued active management of the balance sheet  as recent quarters have yielded organic growth and the higher risk loan balances have declined 
consumer loans decreased million  or  during  driven by the sale of billion  net of write downs  in government guaranteed student loans during the year  partially offset by growth across all other consumer loan classes  with indirect and other direct loans increasing million  or  and million  or  respectively 
loans held for sale lhfs increased billion during the increase was attributable to higher closed mortgage loan volume as a result of the continued low interest rate environment and expanded refinance programs announced by the us government in  coupled with decreased delivery volume to our lhfi portfolio

asset quality our overall asset quality continued to demonstrate favorable trends during  as npl sales contributed to the decline in nonperforming assets during npls declined from december   and totaled billion at december  net charge offs decreased million  or  during  compared to the net charge off ratio fell to during  compared to in early stage delinquencies  excluding government guaranteed loans  improved to of total loans at december  from at december  total early stage delinquencies also improved to at december  from at december  the gradual improvement in our asset quality trends was driven by the intentional reduction of our higher risk loan balances combined with a reduction in inflows of npls 
these items  coupled with our loan sales during and our level of government guaranteed loans at december   have resulted in an improved risk profile and a loan portfolio that more closely aligns with our longer term balance sheet targets 
our nonperforming loans have declined significantly since their peak in  down by billion  or  and during we took actions that further accelerated this decline by selling approximately million of mortgage and commercial real estate npls  net of charge offs 
at december   the percentage of npls to total loans was  down basis points from december  we expect npls to continue to trend down in as asset quality improves and loans move through the foreclosure process

net charge offs have trended favorably for several quarters  and we expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters 
early stage delinquencies of  reached their lowest level in several quarters at december   led by a basis point decrease from year end in residential loans 
at december   all residential loan classes showed improvement compared to december   with nonguaranteed residential mortgages demonstrating the largest improvement  declining basis points 
we expect future early stage delinquency ratio improvements to be driven by residential loans  as they are still elevated by historical standards 
the overall economy  particularly changes in unemployment  will influence any additional improvement 
overall  we are pleased with our improved risk profile and positive trends in credit metrics 
as we look forward  a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends  with additional improvements propelled by the residential portfolio  as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently approaching more normal credit quality levels 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses consists of both the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments

prior to our second lien policy change  we charged off second lien loans at days past due 
during the year we implemented a change in credit policy to recognize the charge off at days past due 
additionally  we changed our policy with respect to residential loans discharged in chapter bankruptcy that had have not been reaffirmed by the borrower even when the borrower was current on their contractually due payments 
this change in policy was in response to recent regulatory guidance 
these increases to charge offs were offset by improvements in credit quality driving lower net charge offs

as of december   the provision for loan losses was down million  or  compared to december  the change in the provision for loan losses was largely attributable to improvements in credit quality trends and lower net charge offs during summary of credit losses experience pre adoption table dollars in millions allowance for credit losses balance beginning of period allowance from acquisitions other activity  net provision for loan losses benefit provision for unfunded commitments charge offs commercial real estate home equity lines construction residential mortgages commercial real estate consumer loans direct indirect credit cards total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate home equity lines construction residential mortgages commercial real estate consumer loans direct indirect credit cards total recoveries net charge offs balance end of period components alll unfunded commitments reserve allowance for credit losses average loans period end loans outstanding ratios alll to period end loans alll to npls alll to net charge offs x x x x x net charge offs to average loans beginning in the fourth quarter of  suntrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income 
given the immateriality of this provision  prior to the fourth quarter of  the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
prior to  borrower misrepresentation and denied insurance claim losses were recorded as operating losses in the consolidated statements of income 
these credit related operating losses totaled million during the year ended december  during  credit related operating losses charged off against previously established reserves within other liabilities totaled million

the decrease in alll was reflective of the continued improvement in the credit quality trends of our loan portfolio as evidenced by reductions in higher risk balances  lower npls  and improved early stage delinquencies 
our risk profile continued to improve  as the amount of certain higher risk loans continued to decline  while government guaranteed loans comprised of the portfolio at december  the variables most impacting the alll continue to be unemployment  residential real estate property values  and the variability and relative strength of the housing market 
at december   the alll to period end loans ratio was  down basis points from december   consistent with continued improvement in asset quality 
when excluding government guaranteed loans  the alll to period end loans declined to at december   compared to at december  the ratio of the alll to total npls was at december   compared to at december  the increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the billion decline in npls  partially offset by the reduction in alll 
the reserve for unfunded commitments was million at december   a decrease of million compared to december  the decrease was primarily driven by lower levels of nonperforming wholesale unfunded commitments and associated reserves

nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual npls 
includes million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from ginnie mae and classified as held for sale at december  nonperforming assets decreased billion  or  during overall  the decrease was attributed to a billion  or  decline in npls noted across all loan classes  largely driven by a decline in residential mortgage npls of million  or  and a reduction of total commercial npls of million  or 
the reduction in npls has been driven by intentionally reducing our higher risk loan balances  including the sale of million of residential mortgage and commercial real estate npls  net of million in charge offs  during partially offsetting the decrease in npls related to loan resolution and sales was the reclassification of million of loans discharged in chapter bankruptcy to npls due to a policy change and million of npls as a result of a policy change to classify as npls performing second lien loans that are subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans 
we elected to make the bankruptcy policy change in order to align our accounting with others in the industry who are adopting this treatment as a result of guidance issued by the occ 
additionally  the decision to transfer performing second lien loans subordinate to nonaccrual first lien loans to npls was driven by interagency regulatory guidance issued during at december   our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was  down from at december  real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the condition of the us housing market 
the amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states  primarily florida  has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process 
these delays may continue to impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming assets portfolio 
nonaccrual loans  loans over days past due and still accruing  and tdr loans  are problem loans or loans with potential weaknesses that are disclosed in the nonperforming assets table above 
loans with known potential credit problems that may not otherwise be disclosed in this table include accruing criticized commercial loans  which are disclosed along with additional credit quality information in note  loans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
at december  and december   there were no known significant potential problem loans that are not otherwise disclosed 
nonperforming loans nonperforming residential loans were the largest driver of the overall decline in npls  decreasing million  down  during the reduction in nonguaranteed residential mortgage npls accounted for million of this decline  primarily due to the sale of million of residential mortgage npls  net of million in charge offs  during residential construction npls decreased million  mainly attributable to net charge offs and lower inflows 
the decrease of million  or  in nonperforming commercial loans also contributed to the decline in npls during specifically  the reduction in nonperforming commercial loans was predominantly driven by a million reduction in commercial real estate npls  which included the sale of million of commercial real estate npls  net of million in charge offs  and a million reduction in commercial construction npls 
as we move through the current commercial real estate market conditions  we continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate npls 
interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is recognized on a cash basis 
interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not typically recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero 
we recognized million and million of interest income related to nonaccrual loans during and  respectively 
if all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms  estimated interest income of million and million during and  respectively  would have been recognized 
other nonperforming assets oreo decreased million  or  during the decline consisted of net decreases of million in residential construction related properties  million in residential homes  and million in commercial properties 
during and  sales of oreo resulted in proceeds of million and million  respectively  contributing to net gains on sales of oreo of million and a net loss of million  respectively  inclusive of valuation reserves  primarily related to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach 
sales of oreo and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities 
see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for more information 
gains and losses on the sale of oreo are recorded in other real estate expense in the consolidated statements of income 
geographically  most of our oreo properties are located in georgia  florida  and north carolina 
residential properties and land comprised and  respectively  of oreo at december   the remainder is related to commercial and other properties 
upon foreclosure  the values of these properties were reevaluated and  if necessary  written down to their then current estimated value less estimated costs to sell 
any further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties 
we are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses 
at december  and  total accruing loans past due ninety days or more included lhfi and lhfs and totaled billion and billion  respectively 
accruing lhfi past due ninety days or more decreased by billion  or  during the changes were primarily driven by the sale of certain government guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans as part of our disposition actions primarily in the second half of the majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency  which comprised and of past due accruing loans at december  and  respectively 
as of the same dates  million and million  respectively  of accruing loans past due ninety days or more were not guaranteed

we describe the consent order in note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and a copy of it was filed as exhibit to the company annual report on form k for the year ended december  the consent order required us to improve certain processes related to residential mortgage loan servicing 
under the consent order  we agreed to retain an independent consultant approved by the frb to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending or completed at any time during and for loans serviced by stm to identify any errors or deficiencies  determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial harm  and prepare a written report detailing the findings 
on january   we  along with nine other mortgage servicers  entered into a acceleration and remediation agreement related to the consent order with the frb to conclude the independent foreclosure review and accelerate remediation to all borrowers whose loans were included in the review

nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual npls 
restructured loans to maximize the collection of loan balances  we evaluate troubled loans on a case by case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate 
we pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt 
for loans secured by residential real estate  if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support a modified loan  we may pursue short sales and or deed in lieu arrangements 
for loans secured by income producing commercial properties  we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review 
we review a number of factors  including cash flows  loan structures  collateral values  and guarantees to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress 
based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk  we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loan s risk profile 
in some cases  we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform 
to date  we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses 
the primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms 
for commercial loans  the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms 
accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower financial difficulties are reported as accruing tdrs 
nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status  typically after six months of repayment performance 
generally  once a residential loan becomes a tdr  we expect that the loan will continue to be reported as a tdr for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market at the time of the modification 
we note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest as modified by the terms of the restructuring  culminating in default  which could result in additional incremental losses 
these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies 
the level of re defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions 
at december  and december   specific reserves included in the alll for residential tdrs were million and million  respectively

total tdrs decreased million as accruing tdrs declined million  or  and nonaccruing tdrs declined million  or  during reductions were primarily driven by loan sale transactions and net charge offs  as well as repayments and a general decrease in the loan balances modified during the year 
the reduction in tdrs was partially offset by a million increase in tdrs due to the policy change for loans discharged in chapter bankruptcy

securities available for sale the securities afs portfolio is managed as part of our overall alm process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks 
changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the year reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio while managing our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile 
during  we repositioned the us treasury and federal agency securities portfolios and increased agency mbs in an effort to capture better relative value 
subsequently  we reduced the size of the securities portfolio by selling low coupon agency mbs and curtailed the reinvestment of principal cash flow due to the lack of attractive investment alternatives  which contributed to the approximately billion reduction of agency mbs 
additionally  we disposed of the coke common stock through a combination of market sales  sales to the counterparty under the agreements  and a charitable contribution 
during the year ended december   the sales  charitable contribution  and the early termination of the agreements resulted in net securities gains of billion and charitable contribution expense of million 
the coke common stock was subject to variable forward agreements which are discussed in note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and in the investment in common shares of the coca cola company section of this md a 
during the year ended december   we recorded billion in net realized gains from the sale of securities afs as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio  compared to net realized gains of million during the same period in  including million and million of otti during and  respectively 
as of december  and our securities afs portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position  which increased marginally during compared to  excluding the coke common stock  due to market value increases during the year 
for additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities afs  see note  securities available for sale  and the trading assets and securities available for sale section of note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
for the year ended december   the average yield on a fte basis for the securities afs portfolio was  compared with for the year ended december  prepayments and maturities of higher yielding securities  reinvestment of principal cash flow at lower yields  and the foregone dividend income on the coke common stock  drove the decline in yield on securities afs 
our total investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of years as of december   compared to years as of december  effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates  taking into consideration embedded options 
an effective duration of years suggests an expected price change of for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates 
the credit quality and liquidity profile of the securities portfolio remained strong at december   and  consequently  we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns 
over the longer term  the size and composition of the investment portfolio will reflect balance sheet trends and our overall liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives 
accordingly  the size and composition of the investment portfolio could change meaningfully over time 
investment in common shares of the coca cola company background prior to september  we had owned common shares of coke since  when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of coke ipo and received common shares of coke in lieu of underwriting fees 
these shares grew in value over the past years and were classified as securities afs with unrealized gains  net of tax  recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares  we accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity 
as of december   we owned million coke shares with an accounting cost basis of approximately  and a fair market value of billion 
on august   we received an additional million coke shares as a result of the coke stock split 
in september  we divested our ownership of coke shares through sales in the market  sales to the counterparty under the agreements discussed below  and a charitable contribution of million shares 
termination of agreements involving coca cola stock in  we entered into two agreements with an unaffiliated third party 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements  we were to deliver to the counterparty either a variable number of our shares in coke or an equivalent amount of cash in lieu of such shares on the and settlement dates 
the counterparty was to deliver to us cash of no less than a floor price of approximately per coke share  or approximately billion in the aggregate the minimum proceeds  and no more than a ceiling price of approximately per coke share prices are adjusted for the coke stock split 
because we expected to sell our shares around the settlement date  either under the terms of the agreements or in another market transaction  the federal reserve granted us tier common capital credit of approximately million  which was reflective of the after tax value of the coke shares at the floor price 
by retaining the shares from until the termination of the agreement  we were able to continue receiving the coke dividends and participate in the price appreciation of the coke shares 
we reevaluated these holdings in light of the regulatory proposal regarding basel iii  which  as proposed  would increase the risk weighted assets of equity holdings and introduce potential volatility to our regulatory capital ratios via fluctuations in aoci  and the negative implications associated with equity securities in assumed adverse economic scenarios within future ccar assessments 
following this review  we and the counterparty accelerated the termination of the agreements 
contemporaneously with entering into the agreements in  the coke counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the bank and suntrust collectively  the notes in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the minimum proceeds 
upon termination of the agreements  we also repurchased the notes from the coke counterparty  resulting in a million loss recorded as an extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of income

these favorable trends  along with continued low rates paid on deposits  were a major contributor to the slight growth in net interest income during the year 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased by billion  or  compared to the growth was concentrated in noninterest bearing dda and savings accounts which increased billion  or 
the increase was partially offset by declines in consumer time and other time deposit account balances which decreased by billion  or 
while a portion of the low cost deposit growth is likely attributable to clients desires related to increased liquidity  we continue to believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our consumer and wholesale businesses as we have expanded the number of primary client relationships during as of december   securities pledged as collateral for deposits totaled billion 
consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key initiatives 
during  we continued to focus on growing our client base  number of households  and deposit share while managing the rates we pay on our deposits 
overall growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies 
we experienced mixed results across our regions due to competitive forces and concentrations of time deposit clients 
other initiatives to attract deposits included enhanced product and feature offerings  enhanced programs and initiatives  and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation 
we continued to provide client facing teammates with new tools that enhance their focus on providing clients with personalized options and an exceptional client experience 
we continued to leverage our brand to improve our visibility in the marketplace and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the evolving banking landscape

other short term borrowings includes master notes  dealer collateral  us treasury demand notes  cp  and other short term borrowed funds 
short term borrowings as of december   our period end short term borrowings decreased billion  or  from december   predominantly due to a billion decrease in short term fhlb advances as a result of our decision to utilize loan sale proceeds during the year to reduce short term borrowings 
we also experienced decreases of million in funds purchased  million in master notes  and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  slightly offset by a million increase in dealer collateral 
for the year ended december   our daily average short term borrowings increased billion  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased daily average fhlb advances of billion  partially offset by decreases in daily average balances for dealer collateral of million  securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million  and funds purchased of million 
for the year ended december   our maximum monthly outstanding balance of fhlb advances was materially higher than the period end and daily average balances as a result of increased holdings of fhlb borrowings towards the beginning of  due to ordinary balance sheet management practices

at december   our capital ratios remain strong  exceeding current regulatory requirements  and are still expected to comply with the proposed requirements under the federal reserve npr as discussed below in the basel iii section 
the increase in the tier common equity ratio was driven by earnings 
the increase in our tier capital ratio was primarily driven by earnings and the issuance of series e preferred stock  partially offset by the redemption of billion of trust preferred securities

additionally  limits exist on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the parent company 
substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the bank  which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities 
at december   retained earnings of the bank available for payment of cash dividends to the parent company under these regulations totaled approximately billion 
there was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the parent company under these regulations at december  during the year ended december   we submitted our ccar capital plans for review by the federal reserve 
the federal reserve review indicated that our capital exceeded requirements throughout the supervisory stress test time horizon without any additional capital actions 
additionally  the federal reserve did not object to us maintaining our current quarterly common stock dividend of per share and our plans to redeem certain trust preferred securities at such time as their governing documents permit  including when these securities are no longer expected to qualify as tier capital 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we declared a quarterly common stock dividend of per share for each quarter and redeemed billion of the outstanding trust preferred securities 
in january  we submitted our ccar capital plan for review and expect the federal reserve to complete their review in march in  we initiated and completed certain elements of our january capital plan  including issuing billion of common stock and billion of senior debt 
we then used the proceeds from those offerings  as well as other available funds  to repurchase billion of fixed rate cumulative preferred stock  series c  and billion of fixed rate cumulative preferred stock  series d  that we had issued to the us treasury under the tarp s cpp in as a result of the repurchase of series c and d preferred stock  we incurred a one time non cash charge to net income loss available to common shareholders of million related to accelerating the outstanding discount accretion on the series c and d preferred stock 
in  the us treasury sold  in a public auction  warrants to purchase million shares of suntrust common stock at an exercise price of per share series b warrants and million shares of suntrust common stock at an exercise price of per share series a warrants 
we had issued the warrants to the us treasury in connection with its investment under the cpp 
the warrants have expiration dates of november series b and december series a 
in conjunction with the auction  we reacquired and retired million of the series a warrants for million 
the composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the dodd frank act in at least two ways over the next several years 
first  the dodd frank act authorizes the federal reserve to enact prudential capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size  risk  complexity  and other factors 
as we expected  the federal reserve used this authority in its npr seeking to implement the basel iii capital requirements  although this authority is not limited to the basel iii requirements 
second  a portion of the dodd frank act sometimes referred to as the collins amendment directs the federal reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies  including us  which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions  such as suntrust bank 
we expect that the federal reserve will apply these to us over a year period beginning january   and that  as a result  as of january   approximately million in principal amount of parent company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding will no longer qualify for tier capital treatment at that time 
we will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us 
preferred stock issuance in  we issued  shares of perpetual preferred stock  series b  no par value and  liquidation preference per share the series b preferred stock 
the series b preferred stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of suntrust 
dividends on the series b preferred stock  if declared  will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the greater of three month libor plus  or 
dividends on the shares are noncumulative 
shares of the series b preferred stock have priority over our common stock with regard to the payment of dividends 
as such  we may not pay dividends on or repurchase  redeem  or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock unless dividends for the series b preferred stock have been declared for that period  and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment 
the series b preferred stock was immediately redeemable upon issuance at our option at a redemption price equal to  per share  plus any declared and unpaid dividends 
except in certain limited circumstances  the series b preferred stock does not have any voting rights 
in december  we issued  shares of perpetual preferred stock  series e  no par value and  liquidation preference per share the series e preferred stock 
the series e preferred stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of suntrust to redeem  repurchase or retire the shares 
dividends on the shares are noncumulative and  if declared  will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum of 
shares of the series e preferred stock have priority over our common stock with regard to the payment of dividends and will rank equally with our outstanding perpetual preferred stock  series a and series b 
as such  we may not pay dividends on or repurchase  redeem  or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock unless dividends for the series e preferred stock have been declared for that period  and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment 
the series e preferred stock is redeemable  at the our option  on any dividend payment date occurring on or after march   at a redemption price equal to  per share  plus any declared and unpaid dividends  without regard to any undeclared dividends 
except in certain limited circumstances  the series e preferred stock does not have any voting rights

basel iii in  the bcbs announced new regulatory capital requirements commonly referred to as basel iii aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements  through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements  new capital conservation buffers  and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure 
basel iii would impose a new common equity tier requirement of up to  comprised of a minimum of plus a capital conservation buffer of up to 
the bcbs has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional  counter cyclical capital buffer on top of basel iii standards 
in june  the federal reserve  fdic  and occ issued several joint nprs to address the implementation of the proposed basel iii regulatory capital framework for us financial institutions  including proposed minimum capital requirements  definitions of qualifying capital instruments  and risk weighted asset calculations 
as proposed  we expect that our risk weighted assets will increase primarily due to increased risk weightings for residential mortgages  commercial real estate loans  and home equity loans  and this will result in a decline in our capital ratios 
under current rules basel i  our tier common equity ratio was at december  we continue to analyze the npr  however  as currently proposed  we estimate our current basel iii tier common ratio  on a fully phased in basis  would be approximately  which would be in compliance with the proposed requirements 
see reconcilement of non us gaap measures annual in this md a for a reconciliation of the current basel i ratio to the proposed basel iii ratio 
further  the npr indicates a phase in for the new capital rules with the proposed risk weightings requirement not becoming effective until notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the timing and content of the final rule  our current tier common ratio estimate calculated using the npr assumptions does not include the effect of any mitigating actions we may undertake to offset some of the anticipated impact of the proposed capital changes 
our estimate of the current period tier common ratio under the npr was calculated using the assumptions prescribed in the npr  which can be found on the federal reserve website 
the agencies are continuing to evaluate the feedback received on the npr and will consider the feedback when drafting a final rule  which could take several quarters to complete 
accordingly  the final rule may differ from the current npr 
we monitor our capital structure to ensure it complies with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and are taking into account these proposed regulations in our capital and strategic planning 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k and are integral to understanding our financial performance 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments  and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  valuing an asset or liability  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates are well controlled  applied consistently from period to period  and the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies 
contingencies we face uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcomes of various contingencies including the allowance for credit losses  mortgage repurchase reserves  and legal and regulatory matters 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is composed of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments 
the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial  consumer  and residential loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr  are individually evaluated to determine the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 
key judgments used in determining the alll include internal risk ratings  market and collateral values  discount rates  loss rates  and our view of current economic conditions 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment  including net charge off trends  internal risk ratings  changes in internal risk ratings  loss forecasts  collateral values  geographic location  delinquency rates  nonperforming and restructured loans  origination channel  product mix  underwriting practices  industry conditions  and economic trends 
in addition to these factors  the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower fico scores and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration 
estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals  broker price opinions  recent sales of foreclosed properties  automated valuation models  other property specific information  and relevant market information  supplemented by our internal property valuation professionals 
the value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property 
in limited instances  we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons  such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property specific factors or recent sales information 
appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property 
our determination of the alll for commercial loans is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings and inherent loss rates at december  assuming a downgrade of one level in the pd risk ratings for commercial loans and leases  the alll would have increased by approximately million at december  in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately million at december  our determination of the allowance for residential and consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates 
in the event that estimated loss severity rates for the residential and consumer loan portfolio increased by percent  the alll for the residential and consumer portfolios would increase  in total  by approximately million at december  because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the alll  these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll 
they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates 
given current processes employed  management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to our financial statements 
in addition to the alll  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience  probability of commitment usage  and any other pertinent information  result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the allowance for credit losses 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit losses 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance for credit losses 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses 
during the last three years  we have experienced elevated delinquencies and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
these market conditions were considered in deriving the estimated allowance for credit losses  however  given the continued economic challenges and uncertainties  the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets sections in this md a as well as note  loans  and note  allowance for credit losses  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
mortgage repurchase reserve we sell residential mortgage loans to investors through whole loan sales in the normal course of our business 
the investors are primarily gses  however  approximately of the population of total loans sold between january  and december  were sold to non agency investors  some in the form of securitizations 
in association with these transactions  we provide representations and warranties to the third party investors that these loans meet certain requirements as agreed to in investor guidelines 
in the last several years  we have seen a significant increase in claims from investors regarding material breaches of these representations and warranties resulting in an elevated level in the repurchase liability 
the majority of the losses incurred have related to loans sold to investors from to we have experienced significantly fewer repurchase claims and losses related to loans sold since as a result of stronger credit performance  more stringent credit guidelines  and underwriting process improvements 
repurchase requests received since have totaled billion which includes ginnie mae repurchase demands 
the following table summarizes demand activity for the years ended december repurchase request activity table dollars in millions beginning pending repurchase requests repurchase requests received repurchase requests resolved repurchased cured total resolved ending pending repurchase requests percent from non agency investors repurchase requests received pending repurchase requests as presented in the table above  repurchase requests were relatively stable in as compared to  even though the first half of reflected a higher pace of repurchase requests 
the repurchase request level subsequently moderated in the second half of the repurchase requests were primarily related to loans sold to fnma from to the repurchase requests continue to be concentrated in loans that are seriously delinquent or have already been through the foreclosure process 
the following table summarizes the original principal balance of loans sold from to  excluding loans sold to ginnie mae  as well as the cumulative default rate and repurchase request rate original principal balance sold table dollars in billions total sold unpaid principal balance gses non agency total sold unpaid principal balance ever days past due ever days past due sold unpaid principal balance total repurchase requests received total repurchase requests ever days past due includes estimates for delinquent loans sold servicing released repurchase requests received during were primarily related to loans sold in the volume of repurchase requests from a particular sale vintage is driven by several factors 
the primary factor is the volume of defaulted loans 
as shown above  the largest volume of defaulted loans is from due to the volume of sales during that year  combined with the credit guidelines applicable to loans originated during that period 
to date  repurchase request volumes were also driven by the inverse relationship between repurchase requests and the amount of time between origination and default 
that is  the shorter the timeframe between origination and default  the greater the repurchase request volume  and the longer the timeframe  the lower the repurchase request volume 
because of this relationship  fewer repurchase requests received during were from loans sold prior to another factor is the investor selection and review process 
we believe that the gses have primarily focused on defaulted loans that have been through the foreclosure process  as well as outstanding loans that are seriously delinquent  and have been much less focused on the outstanding loans that are current 
we believe this is driven by the final dollar severity loss impact to the gses 
the more recent selections  as evidenced by the gses requests for full loan files  have shown some shifts towards outstanding loans that are current 
this could suggest that the gses are working through the backlog of defaulted and seriously delinquent loans from prior years and that the repurchase requests in the latter half of were due to an acceleration of timing of repurchase requests 
our liability for losses resulting from loan repurchases is initially based upon the fair value of these guarantees 
subsequently  the liability is increased for probable losses based on the vintage  product  and investor level based on the most recent information 
the liability is calculated by sales vintage based on various factors including pending repurchase demands  the population of loans that have ever been or more days past due  including loans currently delinquent that are expected to migrate to days past due  the probability that a repurchase request related to a loan that has ever been or expected to be or more days past due will be received  the probability that a loan demanded for repurchase will be repurchased  and historical loss experience 
the previous table presented historical information regarding the population of defaulted loans and repurchase request rates 
the following table presents historical information regarding the repurchase rates and loss severity for loans sold between to repurchase rates and loss severity table dollars in billions total repurchased cured pending total repurchase requests received repurchase rate losses recognized loss severity loss severity last months some of the assumptions used in the reserve process contain a level of uncertainty since they are largely derived from historical experience that has been limited and highly variable 
one of the most critical and judgmental assumptions is the repurchase rate because it requires us to make assessments regarding the actions that will be taken by third party investors in the context of the highly variable history we have experienced with their current volume and timing of requests 
during  we increased the reserve as a result of recent information received from the gses  as well as our recent experience related to full file requests and repurchase demands  which enhanced our ability to estimate future losses attributable to the remaining expected demands on currently delinquent loans sold to the gses prior to these vintage loans have comprised the vast majority of mortgage repurchase losses to date 
consequently  future mortgage repurchase provisions are expected to decline substantially from levels experienced in recent quarters  and we expect the reserve to decline as losses are realized 
once we estimate the level of requests that we expect to receive by vintage  we apply factors for the probability that a loan will be repurchased as well as the loss severity expected 
our life to date repurchase rates are consistent with future expectations  however  given changes in housing prices over the past several years  we believe the loss severity over the past months will be more indicative of our future loss severity rate 
our current estimated liability for contingent losses related to loans sold was million as of december  the liability is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  and the related repurchase provision is recognized in mortgage production related income loss in the consolidated statements of income 
various factors could potentially impact the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our mortgage repurchase reserve estimate 
as previously discussed  the level of repurchase requests we receive is dependent upon the actions of third parties and could differ from the assumptions that we have made 
delinquency levels  delinquency roll rates  and our loss severity assumptions are all highly dependent upon economic factors including changes in real estate values and unemployment levels which are  by nature  difficult to predict 
loss severity assumptions could also be negatively impacted by delays in the foreclosure process which is a heightened risk in some of the states where our loans sold were originated 
approximately of the population of total loans sold between january  and december  were sold to non agency investors  some in the form of securitizations 
due to the nature of these structures and the indirect ownership interests  the potential exists that investors  over time  will become more successful in forcing additional repurchase demands 
while we have used the best information available in estimating the mortgage repurchase reserve liability  these and other factors  along with the discovery of additional information in the future could result in changes in our assumptions which could materially impact our results of operations 
see noninterest income in this md a and note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees loan sales  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion 
legal and regulatory matters we are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts  and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss  if any  in preparing our financial statements 
we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party 
we record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liability is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and related expense is recorded in the applicable category of noninterest expense  depending on the nature of the legal matter  in the consolidated statements of income 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses  and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
in many such proceedings  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  which could have material effects on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
however  it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from these claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued  if any  will not have a material adverse impact to our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion 
estimates of fair value fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments  afs and trading securities  certain lhfi and lhfs  certain issuances of long term debt and brokered cds  and msrs 
we also measure certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the locom  to evaluate assets for impairment  or for disclosure purposes 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include certain lhfs  oreo  goodwill  intangible assets  nonmarketable equity securities  certain partnership investments  and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
the objective of fair value is to use market based inputs or assumptions  when available  to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available  we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  we look to other techniques by obtaining third party quotes or using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flows  while attempting to utilize market observable assumptions to the extent available 
absent current market activity in that specific instrument or a similar instrument  the resulting valuation approach may require making a number of significant judgments in the estimation of fair value 
market conditions during the credit crisis led to limited or nonexistent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we have owned 
although market conditions have improved and we have seen the return of liquidity in certain markets  we continue to experience a low level of activity in a number of markets and also hold a limited amount of instruments that do not have an active market  which creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of these financial instruments 
generally  the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity or observable market are those required to be classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
as a result  various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies  techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates  particularly related to those instruments that require the use of significant  unobservable inputs 
we continue to maintain a cross functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments 
this includes input from not only the related line of business  but also from risk management and finance  to ultimately arrive at a consensus estimate of the instrument fair value after evaluating all available information pertaining to fair value 
this process involves the gathering of multiple sources of information  including broker quotes  values provided by pricing services  trading activity in other similar instruments  market indices  and pricing matrices along with employing various modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses  in arriving at the best estimate of fair value 
modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  market liquidity  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine  and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
we used significant unobservable inputs to fair value  on a recurring basis  for certain trading assets  securities afs  portfolio loans accounted for at fair value  irlcs  lhfs  msrs  and certain derivatives 
overall  the financial impact of the level financial instruments did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital 
our exposure to level financial instruments continues to decline due to paydowns  sales and settlements of these instruments  and minimal purchases 
the following table discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis that have been impacted by level fair value determinations

see note  fair value election and measurement  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a detailed discussion regarding level and securities and valuation methodologies for each class of securities 
trading assets and liabilities and securities afs in estimating the fair values for the majority of securities afs and trading instruments  including residual and certain other retained securitization interests  fair values are based on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments 
specifically  the majority of trading assets and liabilities are priced by the respective trading desk and the majority of securities afs are priced by an independent third party pricing service 
we have an internal  yet independent validation function in place to evaluate the appropriateness of the marks received from third party pricing services 
for trading securities and securities afs in active trading markets  this can be done by comparing the marks against two to three other widely used third party pricing services or sources 
for less liquid instruments  we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed  market information received from outside market participants and analysts  and or changes in the underlying collateral performance 
we also gather third party broker quotes or use industry standard or proprietary models to estimate the fair value of these instruments particularly when pricing service information or observable market trades are not available 
in most cases  the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity 
in those instances  we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument fair value 
when fair values are estimated based on models  we consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and discount rates 
as liquidity returns to certain markets  we have more pricing information from third parties and a reduction in the need to use internal pricing models to estimate fair value 
even when third party pricing is available  we continued to classify certain assets as level as we believe that this third party pricing relied on significant unobservable assumptions  as evidenced by a persistently wide bid ask price range and variability in pricing from the pricing services  particularly for the vintages and exposures we hold 
as certain markets recover  we are able to reduce our exposure to many of our level instruments through sales  maturities  or other distributions at prices approximating our previous estimates  thereby corroborating the valuation approaches used 
many of our remaining level securities  however  will be held until final distribution or maturity 
while it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities  we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be similar to or greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level this assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral  which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values  which reflect downward pressure due to liquidity issues and other broader macro economic conditions 
it is reasonably likely that market volatility for certain instruments will continue as a result of a variety of external factors 
this lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and to use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction  but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions 
the discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument  market indices  and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and or market activity was available 
in certain instances  the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest  however  the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing certain level instruments 
the illiquidity that continues to persist in certain markets requires discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield  as well as to account for the anticipated extended tenor 
the discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to i observable transactions  when available  ii other securities on a relative basis  iii the bid ask spread of non binding broker indicative bids  and or iv our professional judgment 
all of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provide a range of estimated values  which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that  based on management judgment  represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument fair value 
it was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely  in such cases  we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect 
due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level securities  these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility 
improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us 
most derivative instruments are level or level instruments  except for the irlcs and the visa litigation related derivative  which are level instruments 
see note  derivative financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a detailed discussion regarding derivative contracts and valuation 
at december   level trading assets and level securities afs totaled million and million  respectively 
our level securities afs portfolio included fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  as well as certain municipal bond securities  some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market  as such  no significant observable market data for these instruments is available 
these nonmarketable securities afs totaled approximately million at december  the remaining level securities  both trading assets and securities afs  are predominantly private abs and mbs and cdos  including interests retained from company sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations 
we also have exposure to bank trust preferred cdos  student loan abs  and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ars as a result of failed auctions 
for all level securities  little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable 
level trading assets increased by million  or  during the year ended december   primarily due to net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of purchases  partially offset by sales  paydowns  redemptions  and maturities of securities 
level securities afs declined by million  or  during the year ended december   due to continued paydowns and redemptions by issuers of securities  partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of fhlb of atlanta stock purchases 
during the year ended december   we recognized through earnings million in net losses related to trading assets and liabilities and securities afs classified as level  primarily due to the million net loss related to the terminated cash flow hedge reclassification from aoci to earnings relative to the settled coke derivatives during loans the fair values of lhfi and lhfs are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees  and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity 
level loans are predominantly mortgage loans that have been deemed not marketable  largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects 
when estimating fair value for these loans  we use a discounted cash flow approach based on assumptions that are generally not observable in the current markets  such as prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates  and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans 
other intangible assets and other assets we record all msrs at fair value on a recurring basis 
the fair value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can be highly variable quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
this sensitivity analysis does not take into account hedging activities discussed in the other market risk section of this md a 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information 
our oreo properties are concentrated in georgia  florida  and north carolina 
further deterioration in property values in those states or changes to our disposition strategies could cause our estimates of oreo values to decline which would result in further write downs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets  and long lived assets 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable

as of december   our reporting units with goodwill balances were branch banking  diversified commercial banking  cib  and w im 
see note  business segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a further discussion of our reportable segments and changes that occurred during we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of september th  or more often  if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions  as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available 
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations  including projections of future cash flows  discount rates  the fair value of tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities  and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline information 
we assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time  however  supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions  adjusted to reflect our specific factors  as well as current market conditions 
based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of september   we determined for the following reporting units that the fair value is in excess of the respective reporting unit carrying value by the following percentages consumer banking and private wealth management wholesale banking ridgeworth capital management the fair value of the genspring reporting unit  however  was less than its carrying value as of september  as a result  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment evaluation and recorded an impairment loss of million  which was the entire amount of goodwill recorded for the genspring reporting unit prior to the impairment evaluation 
we monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of for all reporting units  of which no events gave rise to an additional impairment test 
valuation techniques in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require assumptions about short and long term net cash flow  growth rates for each reporting unit  as well as discount rates 
additionally  we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information  where available  to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units 
growth assumptions multi year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives  client service and retention standards  market share changes  anticipated loan and deposit growth  forward interest rates  historical performance  and industry and economic trends  among other considerations 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at as of september  and based on management assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation 
discount rate assumptions discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk premium  beta  and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
in the annual analysis as of september   the discount rates ranged from to 
in the annual analysis as of september   the discount rates ranged from to 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors  including current economic and market conditions  company specific growth opportunities  and guideline company and guideline transaction information 
economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company stock price  resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization 
in those circumstances  current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant estimate of entity specific value measured over a reasonable period of time 
as a result  the use of market capitalization is a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units 
therefore  we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions  therefore  in some instances  changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
additionally  a reporting unit carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units 
if there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value  an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed that involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination 
the value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following recent data observed in the market  including similar assets  cash flow modeling based on projected cash flows and market discount rates  market indices  estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  and price indications from independent third parties 
observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant 
the estimated fair values reflect management assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit  liquidity  and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities where we conduct business 
we estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
the estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent  and other pertinent information 
the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertain tax positions 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the tax authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results 
we review our tax positions quarterly and make adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years 
such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of dtas 
a valuation allowance is recognized for a dta if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future pre tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented 
we currently maintain a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards and certain other state dtas 
we expect to realize our remaining federal and state dtas over the allowable carryback and or carryforward periods 
therefore  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state dtas as of december  for additional information  refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the eligible population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions  and healthcare cost for post retirement benefits 
below is a brief description of each variable and the effect it has on our pension costs and post retirement costs 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees eligible to participate in the plan and other factors including historical compensation  age  years of employment  and benefit terms 
a curtailment of all pension benefit accruals was effective december  prior to the pension curtailment  most participants who had or more years of service as of december  received benefits based on a traditional pension formula with benefits linked to their final average pay and years of service 
most other participants received a traditional pension for periods prior to plus a cash balance benefit based on annual compensation and interest credits earned after discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date 
the discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of an event that triggers a measurement to reflect current market conditions 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by less than million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets expected returns on plan assets are computed using long term rate of return assumptions which are selected after considering plan investments  historical returns  and potential future returns 
our pension costs reflect an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets of 
any differences between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we amortize gains losses in pension expense when the total unamortized amount exceeds of plan assets or the projected benefit obligations  whichever is greater 
all pension gains or losses are being amortized over participants average expected future lifetime  which is approximately years 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smooths investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  retirement rate  and disability rate 
these factors do not tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
postretirement healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be an increase of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a decline of approximately million and million  respectively 
to estimate the projected postretirement healthcare benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions 
enterprise risk management in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various risks 
we have established an enterprise risk governance framework to manage these risks and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved 
underlying this framework are limits  policies  processes  and procedures designed to effectively identify  monitor  and manage risk 
the board is wholly responsible for oversight of enterprise risk governance 
the brc assists the board in executing this responsibility 
administration of the framework and governance process is the responsibility of the cro  who executes this responsibility through the crm organization 
the cro reports to the ceo  and provides overall vision  direction  and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework 
additionally  the cro provides regular risk assessments to executive management  the brc  the audit committee of the board  and the full board  and provides other information to executive management and the board  as requested 
our risk governance structure and processes are founded upon three lines of defense  each of which is critical to ensuring that risk and reward in all activities are properly identified  assessed  and managed 
the three lines of defense require effective teamwork combined with individual accountability within defined roles 
the first line of defense is comprised of all teammates within our lines of business and geographies  and also includes select functional group activities 
the first line owns and is accountable for business strategy  performance  management  and controls within their business units and for the identification  management  and reporting of existing and emerging risks 
the second line of defense is comprised of corporate functions  including crm  and is responsible for independent governance and oversight of risk in the first line 
these processes include governance framework design  establishment of policy and oversight of execution  and reporting 
the third line of defense is comprised of the bank assurance functions audit services and risk review  which independently test  verify  and evaluate management controls and provide risk based advice and counsel to management to help develop and maintain a risk management culture that supports business objectives 
enterprise risk governance is supported by a number of risk related  senior management committees 
these governance committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management within their respective areas of authority  and include the crc  alco  the cc  and the pmc 
the crc is chaired by the cro and supports the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
alco is chaired by the cfo  and provides management and oversight of market  liquidity and balance sheet related risks  and has the responsibility to optimize those risks in relation to the profitability of the underlying businesses 
the cc is also chaired by the cfo and provides management and oversight of our capital actions and our ccar program 
pmc is chaired by the wholesale banking executive and provides oversight of balance sheet allocations to ensure that new asset originations and assets available for purchase in the secondary market meet our risk and business objectives 
pmc also oversees progress towards long term balance sheet objectives 
the ceo  cfo  and the cro are members of each governance committee to promote consistency and communication 
additionally  other executive and senior officers of the company are members of these committees based upon their responsibilities and subject matter expertise 
the cro and  by extension  the crm  establishes sound corporate risk processes that focus on identifying  measuring  analyzing  managing  and reporting the risks that we face 
at its core  crm s objective is to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout the organization that identify  measure  analyze  manage  and report risk at the transaction  portfolio  and enterprise levels  optimize decision making  promote sound processes and regulatory compliance  maximize shareholder value  and conform to our principles of client first  one team  executional excellence  and profitable growth in support of our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being 
to achieve this objective  we continually refine our risk governance and management limits  policies  processes  and procedures to reflect changes in our operating environment and or corporate goals and strategies 
in terms of underwriting  we seek to mitigate risk through analysis of such things as a borrower credit history  financial statements  tax returns  cash flow projections  liquidity  and collateral value 
additionally  our loan products and underwriting elements are continuously reviewed and refined 
examples include client eligibility requirements  documentation requirements  loan types  collateral types  ltv ratios  and minimum credit scores 
prior reviews have resulted in changes such as enhanced documentation standards  maximum ltv ratios  and production channels  which contributed to material reductions in higher risk exposures  such as higher risk mortgage  home equity  and commercial construction loans  as well as a decline in early stage delinquencies and nonperforming loans 
in practice  crm measures and oversees risk management along several primary risk dimensions credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance  other risks  such as legal  strategic  and reputational risk  which can arise from any corporate activity  are also monitored by crm and other risk stewards  such as technology risk and compliance  finance risk management  human resources  supplier management  and others 
credit risk programs are overseen by the chief wholesale credit officer and the chief retail credit officer  market risk and liquidity programs are overseen by the corporate market risk officer  operational risk programs  including the enterprise bank secrecy act anti money laundering program  are overseen by the coro  compliance programs are overseen by the corporate compliance officer  and regulatory relations activities are overseen by the corporate regulatory liaison officer 
other activities overseen by crm include risk information and reporting  risk analytics including the alll  and other assurance  such as  risk review and model risk management  and risk administration functions 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  investment securities  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain the long run profitability and capital adequacy of our business 
we commit to maintain and enhance a comprehensive credit system to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards 
crm establishes and oversees the adherence to the credit risk management governance frameworks and policies and independently measures  analyzes  and reports on portfolio and risk trends and actively participates in the formulation of our credit strategies 
credit risk officers and supporting teammates within our lines of business are direct participants in the origination  underwriting  and ongoing management of credit 
they work to promote an appropriate balance between our risk management and business objectives through adherence to established policies  procedures  and standards 
risk review  one of our independent assurance functions  regularly assesses and reports on business unit and enterprise asset quality and the integrity of our credit processes 
additionally  total borrower exposure limits and concentration risk are established and monitored 
credit risk may be mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as cds 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk is evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which is implemented for all lines of businesses 
we use various risk models to estimate both expected and unexpected loss  which incorporates both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect and use internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default  severity  and loss estimation 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  cyber attacks and other security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased 
we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of our profitability 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended to identify  assess  control  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these processes support our goals in seeking to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our coro  who reports directly to the cro 
the operational risk governance structure includes an operational risk manager and support staff within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers are responsible for execution of risk management within their areas in compliance with crm policies and procedures 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of nii and mve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of our balance sheet  which includes all loans 
variable rate loans  prior to any hedging related actions  are approximately of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions  are approximately of total loans 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value 
alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  within policy limits approved by the board 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
no limit breaches occurred during the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  which  as described in additional detail below  are employed by management to understand nii at risk and mve at risk 
these measures show that our interest rate risk profile is slightly asset sensitive 
mve and nii sensitivity are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together 
nii sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and is considered a shorter term measure  while mve sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure 
a positive nii sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year  asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to balance sheet composition 
a negative mve sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that value of the financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which we use to model nii from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of nii over a two year time horizon  which differs from the interest rate sensitivities in table which is prescribed to be over a one year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project nii under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  basis risk analysis  and yield curve twists 
each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on nii levels and sensitivities 
in  we elected to carry billion of fixed rate debt and receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
this change resulted in a material impact to our nii sensitivity profiles as the income on the fair value swaps was no longer being reflected in net interest margin  but in trading income 
as a result  to better illustrate our interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective we previously disclosed the impact of including the fair value swaps in our nii sensitivity profiles separately 
these fair value debt and swap balances have declined to billion as of december  due to maturities and debt repurchases  and as such  the interest rate sensitivity results from an economic perspective has become materially consistent with our primary interest rate sensitivity results shown below 
the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in nii due to instantaneous moves in benchmark interest rates 
traditionally  our analysis of interest rate sensitivity was based on rate changes of and basis points  however  the basis point analysis is less meaningful due to current interest rate levels that are already at or near 
as a result  we have included a more reasonable downward rate change of basis points and also included an additional upward rate change of estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
table estimated change in nii over months basis points december  december  rate change asset sensitivity has slightly increased from december  to december  primarily due to projected balance sheet growth of floating rate assets and fixed rate deposits 
we also perform valuation analysis  which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the nii simulation analysis above 
whereas nii simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as mve 
the sensitivity of mve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the nii simulation  mve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
however  mve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the nii simulation model 
as with the nii simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the mve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
as of december   the mve profile indicates changes due to instantaneous changes in rates 
mve sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks 
market value of equity sensitivity table estimated change in mve basis points december  december  rate change the year over year decrease in mve sensitivity to higher rates is primarily due to shortening of asset durations in a lower rate environment which will reverse to some extent in higher rate scenarios 
a corresponding increase of nii to higher rates  as noted above  is due to a greater mix of floating rate assets than liabilities which would reprice to higher yields over the next year if rates did in fact increase 
while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current year 
further  mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the nii simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
market risk from trading activities under established policies and procedures  we manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets  and foreign exchange activities using a var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk  and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential trading losses using a one day holding period at a one tail  confidence level 
this means that  on average  trading losses are expected to exceed var one out of trading days  or two to three times per year 
we had no backtest exceptions to our overall firmwide var during the years ended december  and the following table presents high  low  and average var value at risk profile table year ended december dollars in millions average var high var low var average var during the year ended december   was unchanged compared to the year ended december  while var can be a useful risk management tool  it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance 
as such  var is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk 
specifically  scenario analysis  stress testing  profit and loss attribution  and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to manage trading risk 
trading assets  net of trading liabilities  averaged billion and billion for the year ended december  and  respectively 
trading assets  net of trading liabilities  were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase in net trading assets was primarily attributable to increases in the trs and fixed income derivatives portfolios 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
we mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
for example  we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets  such as loans  with stable funding sources  such as retail and wholesale deposits  long term debt  and capital 
we primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the parent company and bank levels as the non bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the parent company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments 
the bank s primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio 
the bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a store of liquidity  maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high grade asset classes such as agency mbs  agency debt  and us treasury securities 
as of december   the bank s afs investment portfolio contained billion of unencumbered and liquid securities at book value  of which approximately consisted of agency mbs  agency debt  and us treasury securities 
we manage the parent company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash 
unlike the bank  it is not typical for the parent company to maintain a material investment portfolio of publicly traded securities 
we manage the parent company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations primarily debt and capital service for an extended period of months in accordance with our risk limits 
we assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events  considering both on and off balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments 
we have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades  severe economic recessions  and financial market disruptions 
our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity 
these sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves  the ability to sell  pledge  or borrow against unencumbered securities in the bank s investment portfolio  capacity to borrow from the fhlb system  and the capacity to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
the following table presents year end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the years ended december  and we believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs 
contingent liquidity sources table december  december  dollars in billions as of average for the year ended as of average for the year ended excess reserves free and liquid investment portfolio securities fhlb borrowing capacity discount window borrowing capacity total average based upon month end data  except excess reserves  which is based upon a daily average 
uses of funds 
our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit  the purchase of investment securities  working capital  and debt and capital service 
the bank and the parent company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as fed funds  eurodollars  and cp 
as of december   the parent company had no cp outstanding and the bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its federal reserve account 
in the absence of robust loan demand  we have chosen to deploy some liquidity to retire certain high cost debt securities or other borrowings 
for example  during the year ended december   we used cash on hand to retire billion of high cost  fixed rate trust preferred securities including suntrust capital viii and suntrust capital ix 
we called these securities pursuant to a change in regulatory capital treatment for trust preferred securities as part of new capital rules announced by the federal reserve 
the parent company retains a material cash position  in accordance with our policies and risk limits  discussed in greater detail below 
contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades 
factors that affect our credit ratings include  but are not limited to  the credit risk profile of our assets  the adequacy of our alll  the level and stability of our earnings  the liquidity profile of both the bank and the parent company  the economic environment  and the adequacy of our capital base 
as of december   s p maintained a positive outlook and moody s  fitch  and dbrs all maintained a stable outlook on our credit ratings 
future credit rating downgrades are possible  although not currently anticipated given the positive and stable credit rating outlooks 
debt credit ratings and outlook table as of december  moody s s p fitch dbrs suntrust banks  inc short term p a f r low senior long term baa bbb bbb a low suntrust bank short term p a f r low senior long term a bbb bbb a outlook stable positive stable stable sources of funds 
our primary source of funds is a large  stable retail deposit base 
core deposits  predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits  originate primarily from our retail branch network and are our largest and most cost effective source of funding 
core deposits increased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  we also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources 
these uncommitted sources include fed funds purchased from other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable cds  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank notes  and cp 
aggregate wholesale funding decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  net short term unsecured borrowings  which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits  as well as fed funds purchased  decreased to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  as mentioned above  the bank and parent company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets 
the parent company maintains an sec shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock 
our board has authorized the issuance of up to billion of such securities  of which approximately billion of issuance capacity remains available 
on november   we issued million of senior parent company notes due january  and throughout we have issued several small structured notes for the parent company in the amount of million 
the bank also maintains a global bank note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms 
as of december   the bank had billion of remaining capacity to issue notes under the program 
our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our board  or formal program capacity  and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor 
debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors 
institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors  including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector 
parent company liquidity 
our primary measure of parent company liquidity is the length of time the parent company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the bank or new debt issuance 
as of december   this measure was well in excess of the current limit 
our board risk committee regularly reviews this measure and other risk metrics 
in accordance with risk limits established by alco and the board  we manage the parent company s liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time 
during the year ended december   approximately billion of parent company debt matured and there is no parent company debt scheduled to mature in as mentioned above  we redeemed approximately billion of trust preferred securities at the parent company that will not receive tier capital credit under proposed regulatory capital rules using cash on hand 
in december  the parent company issued million of series e preferred stock that qualifies as tier capital under the new regulatory capital rules 
like the series e preferred stock  a majority of the parent company s other liabilities are long term in nature  coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long term senior and subordinated notes 
the primary uses of parent company liquidity include debt service  dividends on capital instruments  the periodic purchase of investment securities  and loans to our subsidiaries 
we fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary 
we are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances 
recent developments 
during we executed several balance sheet restructuring transactions that included the early termination of agreements related to our shares of coke common stock and the sale of certain loan portfolios 
after selling the coke shares  repurchasing the notes issued as part of the transaction  and paying taxes on the gains generated by the share sale  the net liquidity impact for the bank and the parent company associated with the early termination of the coke share agreements was immaterial 
however  the bank received significant proceeds from the sale of the loan portfolios  as further discussed in the loans section of this md a 
numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective 
for example  the bcbs published in january revised standards for the proposed lcr that would require banks to hold unencumbered high quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected cash outflows under a prescribed day stress scenario 
the lcr is subject to an observation period that began in  but will be phased in as a requirement beginning january  while the potential impact of this and other regulatory proposals cannot be fully quantified at present  we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and prudent liquidity management practices 
in  the federal reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms  pursuant to sections and of the dodd frank act 
these proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases 
the first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices  including internal liquidity stress testing 
the second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed basel iii liquidity standards 
we believe that we will be well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted 
other liquidity considerations 
as presented in table  we had an aggregate potential obligation of billion to our clients in unused lines of credit at december  commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit  which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur 
approximately billion of these letters supported variable rate demand obligations as of december  as of december   our liability for utbs was million and the liability for interest related to these utbs was million 
the utbs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes 
the utbs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions  and if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal operating cash flows  likely over multiple years

other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage lhfs ie  the warehouse and our irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate loans 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures  and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
the irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships 
msrs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates  primarily the year current coupon par mortgage rate 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
given the basis points drop in rates  prepayments for were up significantly over but were more than offset by growth in new msrs additions during the year 
msrs  which are carried at fair value  totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes 
we recorded declines of million and million in the fair value of our msrs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  we originated msrs with fair values at the time of origination of million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses related to msrs of million and million including decay of million and million  respectively  inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges 
we also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the fhlb of atlanta and from capital stock we hold in the federal reserve bank 
in order to be an fhlb member  we are required to purchase capital stock in the fhlb 
in exchange  members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low cost loans for affordable housing and community development projects  amongst other benefits 
as of december   we held a total of million of capital stock in the fhlb  a decrease of million compared to december  in order to become a member of the federal reserve system  regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as either a percentage of the bank s capital or as a percentage of total deposit liabilities 
as of december   we held million of federal reserve bank stock  which is relatively unchanged from december  we also hold  as of december   a total net book value of approximately million of private equity direct investments and other equity related investments 
we generally hold these investments as long term investments 
if conditions in the market deteriorate  impairment charges could occur related to these long term investments and other assets  including but not limited to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we continue to monitor our holdings of foreign debt  securities  and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations  both funded and unfunded 
specifically  the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic  fiscal  and or political strains 
at december   we identified five countries in europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic  fiscal  and political strains were not present 
the countries we identified were greece  ireland  italy  portugal  and spain  and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during and  and continuing to exist as of december  at december   we had no direct exposure to sovereign debt of these countries 
however  at december   we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of million that was comprised of unfunded commitments to lend  funded loans  and a nominal amount of letters of credit 
indirect exposure to these countries was million at december  and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure 
the majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued on behalf of our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement  wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries 
overall  gross exposure to these countries continues to be less than of our total assets as of december   consistent with our exposure at december  off balance sheet arrangements see discussion of off balance sheet arrangements in note  certain transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities  and note  reinsurance arrangements and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k
