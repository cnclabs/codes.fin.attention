item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of for a discussion of indicators of forward looking statements and specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements  see risk factors under part i item a of this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section should be read and interpreted in light of such factors 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
you may have difficulty evaluating our business  because we completed a partial spin off rxi on april  since the partial spin off  our financial statements have no longer reflected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rxi  and we have accounted for our partial ownership of rxi based on the cost method of accounting 
for these reasons  the historical consolidated financial information included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows that we will achieve in the future 
background on the company and recent change in strategic focus galena biopharma  inc we  us  our  galena or the company is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative  targeted oncology treatments addressing major unmet medical needs to advance cancer care 
we currently are developing innovative  peptide antigen based off the shelf cancer immunotherapies for potential application to treatment of large populations of cancer survivors 
peptide vaccines have several potential clinical advantages over existing cancer treatments including excellent safety profiles  long lasting protection through immune system activation  as well as an acceptable mode of administration intradermal injection 
in addition  there are potential commercial advantages in that these are readily and reproducibly manufactured products that could have a wide reach into the physicians office  with no special requirements for delivery to the office or to patients 

table of contents a key differentiator in our approach is a focus on minimal residual disease that may remain in cancer survivors 
the strategy is to prevent recurrence in early stage patient groups who may harbor occult residual cancer cells that are not detectable by current imaging and biomarkers  and despite adjuvant therapy and radiation therapy will relapse in significant numbers over time 
our lead product candidate  neuvax nelipepimut s is the immmunodominant nonapeptide derived from the extracellular domain of the her human epidermal growth factor receptor protein  a well established target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer 
the nelipepimut sequence stimulates specific cd cytotoxic t lymphocytes  or ctls  following binding to hla a a molecules on antigen presenting cells  or apc 
these activated specific ctls recognize  neutralize and destroy through cell lysis her expressing cancer cells  including occult cancer cells and micrometastatic foci 
the nelipepimut immune response can also generate ctls to other immunogenic peptides through inter and intra antigenic epitope spreading 
based on a successful phase trial  the us food and drug administration  or fda  granted neuvax a special protocol assessment  or spa  for its phase present prevention of recurrence in early stage  node positive breast cancer with low to intermediate her expression with neuvax treatment trial 
the primary endpoint of the phase trial was disease free survival  or dfs 
if the randomized  double blinded  multinational  patient present trial is successful  we intend to seek fda commercial registration of neuvax 
based on a pilot study and preclinical evidence suggesting enhanced efficacy of using neuvax in combination with herceptin trastuzumab genentech roche  we recently commenced a randomized multicenter phase clinical trial  neuvax in combination with herceptin in breast cancer patients 
our second product candidate  folate binding protein  or fbp  is the e peptide over expressed fold in more than of ovarian and endometrial cancers 
fbp is currently in a phase clinical trial 
we acquired neuvax in april in connection with our merger acquisition of apthera  inc  or apthera 
prior to that time  we were engaged primarily in conducting discovery research and preclinical development activities based on rnai 
in connection with our acquisition of neuvax  we reduced the scope of our rnai activities 
on september   we changed our name to galena biopharma  inc from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation in connection with the proposed partial spin off of our former subsidiary  rxi pharmaceuticals corporation  or rxi 
rxi was initially incorporated as rncs  inc and assumed the name rxi pharmaceuticals corporation in conjunction with the change in our name to galena 
on april   we completed the partial spin off of rxi  which is engaged in the development of novel rnai based therapies 
our oncology therapeutic programs the chart below summarizes the current status of our oncology drug development programs  with the dark shading indicating completed stages of development and the light shading indicating development activities we intend to prioritize in the near term logo 
table of contents we currently are developing a pipeline of immunotherapy product candidates for the treatment of various cancers based on the peptide cancer vaccines  the most advanced of which is neuvax  which is targeted at preventing the recurrence of breast cancer 
neuvax has had positive phase clinical trial results for the prevention of breast cancer recurrence in patients who have had breast cancer and received the standard of care treatment surgery  chemotherapy  radiotherapy and hormonal therapy as indicated 
we recently initiated our phase present clinical trial of neuvax for the prevention of breast cancer recurrence in early stage low to intermediate her breast cancer patients 
for the results of a single trial to support registration for an indication  the results of the trial must be internally consistent  clinically meaningful  and statistically very persuasive 
specifically  fda has indicated that  in general  the results from two phase studies would be required to support approval  and it would accept a single pivotal study in support of approval if the results of the trial was internally consistent  clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive 
neuvax is an immunotherapy that stimulates the immune system to actively seek out and selectively kill cancer cells 
neuvax directs killer t cells to target and destroy cancer cells that express her neu  a protein associated with epithelial tumors in breast  ovarian  pancreatic  colon  bladder and prostate cancers 
neuvax is comprised of a her neu derived peptide called nelipepimut s 
nelipepimut s is a nine amino acid sequence that is immunogenic produces an immune response and gm csf is a commercially available protein that acts to stimulate and activate components of the immune system such as macrophages and dendritic cells 
of women diagnosed with breast cancer  only about are her positive ihc 
neuvax targets her ihc and patients who are approximately of breast cancer patients 
these patients achieve remission with current standard of care  but have no available her targeted adjuvant treatment options to maintain their disease free status 
we believe that approximately  of the approximately  women diagnosed with breast cancer in the united states each year meet these criteria 
in addition  it is estimated that more than approximately  women in europe are diagnosed with breast cancer annually 
based on the phase target patient population consisting of node positive  her ihc or  and hla type a or a patients  the target markets for neuvax are approximately  patients annually in the us and approximately  patients annually in europe 
we are also developing novel applications for neuvax based on preclinical studies and phase clinical trials which suggest that combining neuvax and trastuzumab herceptin  genentech roche can increase antigen presentation by tumor cells by promoting receptor internalization and subsequent proteosomal degradation of the her protein 
we previously reported a phase trial of sequential therapy with trastuzumab followed by her vaccination in the adjuvant setting 
of patients who received standard of care trastuzumab  the who received no her vaccine experienced a breast cancer recurrence rate  which is comparable to reported rates of similarly staged and treated patients 
in contrast  none of the patients who received the her vaccine following trastuzumab therapy experience a recurrence 
based on these results  we have commenced a randomized  multicenter phase trial in patients that will compare neuvax with trastuzumab versus trastuzumab with gm csf 
we intend to pursue additional therapeutic indications for neuvax 
under our investigational new drug application  or ind  open protocols for the treatment of prostate cancer  ovarian cancer and bladder cancer exist for patient populations with the same general criteria for eligibility as in breast cancer ie  early stage disease and adjuvant treatment setting after surgery with immunologic competence 
an early stage clinical study in high risk prostate cancer confirmed the ability of the patients to mount an nelipepimut s specific immune response 
we may explore whether neuvax provides clinical benefits in other areas  such as a prophylactic vaccine against breast cancer occurrence in healthy women with a high likelihood for developing breast cancer based on genetic assays or biomarkers and a strong positive familial history of breast cancer  and in her overexpressing gastric cancer 
herceptin is approved for this indication  and there is a significant clinical rationale for neuvax s potential efficacy in this indication 
we also may investigate the use of neuvax in combination with other therapies with a view to leveraging neuvax s attractive safety profile and targeted mechanism of action 
clinical trials conducted on neuvax have provided proof of principle data in early stage node negative breast cancer  although such data is preliminary and not statistically significant  since the trials were not designed to provide statistically significant efficacy data 
both the early stage node negative breast cancer indication and the high risk patient indication are longer term areas of interest that we currently expect to explore only with support from corporate partners 
we have not generated revenue to date and may not generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if ever 
we expect to incur significant operating losses as we advance our product candidates through the drug development and regulatory process 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development programs 
as a result of the costs expected to be incurred in connection with our recently commenced clinical trials of neuvax and fbp  our research and development expenses have increased significantly from historic levels 
we will need significant additional cash resources to complete our planned clinical trials 
therefore  we will either need to begin generating significant product revenue or  in the absence of product revenue  we will need to pursue equity financings  funded research and development programs and partnership and collaborative arrangements 
there is no guarantee that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we would be forced to scale back or terminate our operations  or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company 

table of contents research and development our research and development programs are focused on developing cancer therapies utilizing peptide based immunotherapy products  including our main product candidate neuvax  for the treatment of various cancers 
since we commenced operations  research and development has comprised a significant proportion of our total operating expenses and is expected to comprise the majority of our spending for the foreseeable future 
there are risks in any new field of drug discovery that preclude certainty regarding the successful development of a product 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any product candidate 
our inability to make these estimates results from the uncertainty of numerous factors  including but not limited to our ability to advance product candidates into preclinical research and clinical trials  the scope and rate of progress of our preclinical program and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the effect of government regulation and insurance industry efforts to control healthcare costs through reimbursement policy and other cost management strategies 
failure to complete any stage of the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
license agreements we have entered into licensing relationships with academic institutions  research foundations and commercial entities  and may seek to enter into additional licenses with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we also may enter into strategic alliances to expand our intellectual property portfolio and to potentially accelerate our development programs by gaining access to technology and funding  including equity sales  license fees and other revenues 
for each product that we develop that is covered by the patents licensed to us including our material licenses discussed elsewhere in this annual report  we are obligated to make additional payments upon the attainment of certain specified product development milestones 
see business intellectual property under part i item of this annual report for information on our material license agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates  allocations and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience and on other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  the financial information included here may not necessarily reflect the financial position  operating results  changes in our invested equity and cash flows in the future 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
included in research and development costs are wages  benefits and other operating costs  facilities  supplies  external services and overhead related to our research and development departments  as well as costs to acquire technology licenses and clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organizations cro  as well as set up and patient related costs from the sites at which are trial is being conducted which are billed to us by our cros as pass through costs 
direct costs associated with our cros are generally payable both as fixed fees and as certain enrollment and monitoring milestones are achieved 
because there is substantive uncertainty related to the achievement of these milestones  the achievement of the milestones is generally attained based on the performance of our cros 
payment is only due if the milestone is reached and we recognize the entire expense related to each milestone in the period the milestone is reached 
the invoicing from sites can be delayed by several months 
we accrue these site costs based on our estimate of up front set up costs upon the screening of the first patient at each site  and the patient related costs based on our knowledge of patient enrollment status at each site 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants  including employee stock options 
stock compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
for stock options granted as consideration for services rendered by non employees  we recognize compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc topic asc  equity based payments to non employees 
non employee option grants that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the vesting period of the underlying stock options 
at the end of each financial reporting period prior to vesting  the value of these options  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  will be re measured using the fair value of our common stock and the non cash compensation recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly 
since the fair market value of options granted to non employees is subject to change in the future  the amount of the future compensation expense will include fair value re measurements until the stock options are fully vested 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  with the following assumptions risk free interest rate volatility expected lives years expected dividend yield 
table of contents the company s expected common stock price volatility assumption is based upon the volatility of a basket of companies that we consider comparable to us 
the expected life assumptions for employee grants were based upon the simplified method provided for under asc  which averages the contractual term of the options of ten years with the average vesting term of four years for an average of six years 
the expected life assumptions for non employees were based upon the contractual term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption of zero is based upon the fact that the company has never paid cash dividends and presently has no intention of paying cash dividends in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant was also based upon prevailing short term interest rates 
the company has an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of for options granted to employees  and for options granted to senior management and no forfeiture rate for the directors 
the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture rates are higher than estimated 
derivative financial instruments during the normal course of business  from time to time  we issue warrants and options to vendors as consideration to perform services 
we may also issue warrants as part of a debt or equity financing 
we do not enter into any derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
we recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair value with changes in fair value of derivatives reflected as current period income or loss unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for as such 
during the years ended december  and  we issued warrants to purchase approximately  and  shares of common stock  respectively  in connection with equity transactions 
in accordance with asc topic  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own stock asc  the value of these warrants is required to be recorded as a liability  as the holders have an option to put the warrants back to us in certain events  as defined  and the warrants are determined not to be indexed to the company s own stock 
the derivative liabilities are remeasured each period end to the estimated fair value 
the fair value of our derivative liabilities is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  with the following assumptions at december december  december  risk free interest rate volatility expected lives years expected dividend yield the company s expected common stock price volatility assumption is based upon the volatility of a basket of companies that we consider comparable to us 
the expected life assumptions for the warrants is estimated to be the instruments contractual term 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
some of the items  including property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves require a degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
management finalizes the purchase price allocation within months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets in connection with our acquisition of apthera in  we recorded approximately  of goodwill and  million of acquired in process research and development  an indefinite lived intangible asset 
the projects acquired in the acquisition consisted primarily of the clinical development related to its clinical oncology program  primarily the neuvax compound for breast cancer patients 
we purchased this with the intent of clinically developing the neuvax compound for market approval 
at the date we acquired the neuvax compound  the program was in a phase clinical trial 
in order to commercialize this drug  the company will need to complete at least one phase clinical trial 
on january   we initiated our phase present trial for neuvax nelipepimut s peptide plus gm csf vaccine in low to intermediate her and breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrence clinicaltrials 
gov identifier nct 
the cost of this phase clinical trial  including amounts expended through  is expected to exceed million to reach its primary endpoint 
we do not expect to commence commercialization of neuvax prior to  if at all 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an interim review for impairment include  but are not limited to  the following significant changes in the manner of its use of acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment first by a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of impairment 
if it is determined that impairment is more likely than not  we then proceed to the two step impairment test 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit the first step 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment the second step 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
in its review of the carrying value of the goodwill for its single reporting unit and its indefinite lived intangible assets  the company determines fair values of its goodwill using the market approach  and its indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach 
in connection with its annual impairment test  the company performed its review for impairment using the qualitative assessment for both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and has determined that there has been no impairment to either of these assets as of december  valuation of contingent purchase price consideration acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on the achievement of certain future financial performance measures of the acquired company earn out 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date 
we estimate the fair value of these liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
we evaluate  on a routine  periodic basis  the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration and changes in estimated fair value  subsequent to the initial fair value estimate at the time of the acquisition  are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of expenses 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates  changes in the timing of development milestones achieved and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria 
any changes in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration may have a material impact on our operating results 
results of operations for the year ended december   our net loss was approximately  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations was  and  and loss from discontinued operations was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for variation in the operating results between the years are discussed below 
revenue we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company and have not generated any revenue since inception through december  research and development expense in thousands for the years ended december  research and development expense research and development employee stock based compensation expense research and development non employee stock based compensation expense total research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of compensation related costs for our employees dedicated to clinical development and the related regulatory activities and for clinical trial related costs  licensing fees  patent prosecution costs and the cost of lab supplies used in our clinical development programs 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to our clinical development programs 
as a result of the costs expected to be incurred in connection with our clinical trials of neuvax and fbp  our research and development expense has increased significantly from historic levels and is expected to remain at such increased level for the foreseeable future 

table of contents total research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was due to an increase of  in research and development cash expense related to preparation for our phase present clinical trial of neuvax  an increase of  in employee stock based compensation and a  increase in non employee stock based compensation expense 
research and development non employee stock based compensation expense we have issued options to purchase shares of our common stock as compensation to our scientific advisory board sab members and consultants 
for financial statement purposes  we valued these shares at their fair value 
fluctuations in non employee stock based compensation expense results from variations in the number of common stock options issued  vesting schedules and the black scholes fair values of common stock options granted to sab members 
general and administrative expense in thousands for the years ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative employee stock based compensation general and administrative non employee stock based compensation total general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes compensation related costs for our employees dedicated to general and administrative activities  legal fees  audit and tax fees  consultants and professional services and general corporate expenses 
total general and administrative expense was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was primarily due to a decrease of  in cash based expense due to the costs related to the spin off of rxi  and a decrease of  for employee stock based compensation expense  largely due to the lower strike prices and volatility assumptions used to calculate stock based compensation using the black scholes pricing model 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in warrants and other stock based compensation issued to non employees for business advisory and other services 
from time to time  we expect to issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we will value these shares of common stock  common stock options  and warrants at their fair value 
interest income interest income was negligible for both the year ended december   and december  the key objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal and ensure sufficient liquidity  so our invested cash may not earn as high a level of income as longer term or higher risk securities  which generally have less liquidity and more volatility 
the interest rates available on lower risk  shorter term investments in today s market are lower than rates available in the prior period 
we expect to have interest income in future periods based on our current account balances and potentially from additional capital we may receive in the future 
other income other income expense is summarized as follows in thousands for the years ended december  interest expense  net change in the fair value of common stock warrants classified as liabilities change in fair value of the contingent purchase price liability miscellaneous other income other income expense  net other expense  net  was  and other income  net  was  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall decrease of  or  was primarily due to an decrease of  attributable to the change in fair value of common stock warrants outstanding  largely driven by changes in our market price and volatility  and a decrease of  in the estimated fair value of the contingent purchase price consideration due to a shorter amount of time and a lower discount related to the time value of money  to the estimated date that some of the larger milestones will be reached 

table of contents income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  related to the unrealized gain on available for sale securities 
accounting standards codification asc  accounting for income taxes  requires a benefit to be recorded to continuing operations when consideration is given to all other categories of income or losses in the financial statements 
due to the fact that we incurred significant tax losses  there was no expense recorded during or a deferred tax benefit would have been recorded for losses  however  due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit  a valuation allowance was recognized which fully offset such deferred tax benefit 
due to the fact that we incurred significant tax losses  there was no expense recorded during or a deferred tax benefit would have been recorded for losses  however  due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefit  a valuation allowance was recognized which fully offset such deferred tax benefit 
loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in loss from discontinued operations is due to the fact that rxi has operated as a separate entity following the completion of its spin off from galena on april  liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  as of december  and approximately  as of march  we currently own  shares of rxi common stock  which are subject to a one year lock up period that expires in april  and are carried as marketable securities at fair value on our balance sheet in the amount of  at december  our rxi shares constitute restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
as such  we may not sell our rxi shares publicly except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act or an available exemption from registration such as rule or regulation s under the securities act 
under rule as currently in effect  if and so long as we are deemed to be an affiliate of rxi  we are entitled to sell within any three month period a number of shares of our rxi common stock that does not exceed the greater of of the number of shares of rxi common stock then outstanding  or the average weekly trading volume of rxi common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on form with respect to such sale 
under regulation s as currently in effect  we may sell our rxi shares in an offshore transaction so long as there are no directed selling efforts in the us of such rxi shares 
in event we were to decide to sell our rxi shares  there may not be a ready market for our rxi shares  and there is no assurance as to the sales price of any rxi shares that we may sell 
we have not generated revenue to date and may not generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if ever 
we expect to incur significant operating losses as we advance our product candidates through the drug development and regulatory process 
as a result of the increased research and development expense expected to be incurred in connection with our clinical trials of neuvax and fbp  our expenses have increased significantly from historic levels 
in addition to increasing research and development expense  we expect general and administrative costs to increase as we conduct future clinical trials 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and might never do so 
in the absence of product revenue  our potential sources of operational funding are expected to be the proceeds from the sale of equity  funded research and development payments and payments received under partnership and collaborative agreements 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents other working capital should be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the second quarter of this projection is based on our current planned operations and is subject to changes in our plans and uncertainties inherent in our business  and we may need to seek to replenish our existing cash and cash equivalents sooner than we project 
net cash flow from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of approximately  resulted from an increase in the year over year net loss of approximately  less adjustment for non cash items such as stock based compensation  depreciation  the increase in the fair value of the contingent purchase price consideration  the increase in the fair value of warrants classified as liabilities and changes in current assets and liabilities 
net cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  the decrease of approximately  in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to change in restricted cash  cash used to purchase equipment and furnishings and cash received in the apthera acquisition during as offset by the cash transferred in the rxi spin off in net cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of approximately  was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  and  in proceeds from the exercise of warrants not realized during 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards updated asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  a new accounting standard that clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this new standard is effective on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december  adoption of this new standard for the fiscal year ended december  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  a new accounting standard to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previous guidance under topic required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this new standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this new standard for the fiscal year ended december  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets  a new accounting pronouncement intended to simplify how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
the new standard permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  adoption of this new standard for the fiscal year ended december  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
