overview skullcandy is a leading global designer  marketer and distributor of performance audio and gaming headphones and other accessory related products under the skullcandy  astro gaming and xl by skullcandy brands 
skullcandy was launched in and quickly became one of the world s most distinct audio brands by bringing unique technology  color  character and performance to an otherwise monochromatic space  helping to revolutionize the audio arena by introducing headphones  earbuds and other audio and wireless lifestyle products that possess unmistakable style and exceptional performance 
our products are sold and distributed through a variety of channels in the us and approximately countries worldwide 
the skullcandy name and distinctive logo have rapidly become iconic and have contributed to our strong market position and profitability 
our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of headphones and audio accessories 
we pioneered the distribution of headphones in specialty retailers focused on action sports and the youth lifestyle  such as zumiez  tilly s and hundreds of independent snow  skate and surf retailers 
through this channel we reach consumer influencers  individuals who help establish and maintain the credibility and authenticity of our brand 
building on this foundation  we have successfully expanded our distribution to select consumer electronics  mass  sporting goods and mobile phone retailers such as best buy  target  dick s sporting goods and at t wireless 
a number of industry trends have facilitated our growth to date  and we expect these trends to continue 
the increasing use of portable media devices  such as apple s ipod  and smartphones with integrated music and video capabilities  such as apple s iphone and third party android based phones  has driven growth in the headphones and audio accessories markets 
our brand also benefits from the increasing popularity of action sports  particularly within the youth culture 
our consumer influencers are teens and young adults that associate themselves with skateboarding  snowboarding  surfing and other action sports 
these consumers influence a broader consumer base that identifies with authentic action sports lifestyle brands 
in addition  music is an integral part of the youth action sports lifestyle  and headphones have become an accessory worn to express individuality 
we believe these trends provide us with an expanding consumer base for our products 
furthermore  we believe that these trends in preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states and are prevalent in a number of markets around the world 
we face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities  including  among others  the risk that we may not be able to effectively extend the recognition and reputation of our brand or continue to develop innovative and popular products 
we also face the risk that we may not be able to sustain our past growth or manage our anticipated future growth 
in addition  we rely on target and best buy for a significant portion of our net sales 
best buy accounted for more than of our net sales during  and moreover  we expect to experience growth internationally  which will require significant additional operating expenditures and increase our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations 
furthermore  our industry is very competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively 
see risk factors for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business

international net sales increased to million  or of our net sales in from million in on august   we completed the purchase of all outstanding stock of kungsbacka ab  a subsidiary of north  for million 
prior to august   north had exclusive distribution rights of our products in the european markets 
kungsbacka ab previously held an exclusive distribution agreement for skullcandy products in europe through november of the acquisition has enabled us to take direct control of our european business  which we believe is allowing us to capture revenue that would otherwise have been earned by north and accelerate our growth in this region 
prior to our acquisition of kungsbacka ab on august   we operated in one business segment 
following the acquisition  we operated in two segments north america and international 
as a result  the twelve months ended december  are not comparable to the twelve months ended december  as the prior year does not include a full year of activity for our international segment since the international segment started on august  also  included in the north america segment for and are net sales of million and million  respectively  which represent products that were sold from north america to retailers and distributors in other countries

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  decreased percentage points to in from in north america gross margin decreased percentage points to from in the decrease in north america gross margin is mostly due to a shift in sales mix to higher price point products with lower gross margin structures  lower margin sales to the closeout channel and an increase in the level of discounting provided to our customers 
the international gross margin increased percentage points to from in international gross margin in was lower as a result of inventory that was acquired from kungsbacka ab that was recorded at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting 
the increase in gross margin in is also based on new sourcing initiatives and a higher mix of direct international sales

the derivative liability was recorded as a derivative due to the variability in the potential amount payable 
the estimated fair value of this derivative was approximately million as of december  and june  the amount became fixed at million upon the consummation of our ipo and the additional million was included in other expense

table of contents income taxes income taxes were million in compared to million in our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the difference between the book and tax treatment of incentive stock options and the expenses related to the second and third contingent payments pursuant to the securities purchase and redemption agreement which were not deductible for tax purposes in the rate also decreased due to a higher proportionate level of income in countries with lower statutory rates 
in addition  we had a higher level of disqualifying dispositions and lower share based compensation expense related to incentive stock options in we expect our effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis depending upon the proportionate levels of income in countries with lower statutory rates compared to countries with higher statutory rates

our obligations under the securities purchase and redemption agreement were completed upon consummation of our ipo 
the absence of compensation expenses associated with the securities purchase and redemption agreement was offset in by an increase in recurring payroll and benefits expenses as a result of increased employee headcount to support planned growth 
headcount increased from approximately employees as of december  to approximately employees as of december  as a result of these factors  payroll and benefits expenses decreased million or 
marketing expenses increased million or due to higher expenses associated with in store advertising  in store displays  trade show attendance  event and athlete sponsorships and promotional products

interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in from million in interest expense decreased by approximately million due to the elimination of all long term debt in july of all long term debt was paid with the ipo proceeds or was converted to common stock 
this decrease was offset by an increase in interest expense of million related to the second contingent payment paid pursuant to the securities purchase and redemption agreement that was incurred in connection with the ipo 
because this obligation had a stated term and no stated interest rate  it was recorded at its net present value of million as of december  using an implied interest rate of 
as of july   when the ipo became effective  the amount payable was accreted to its stated value of million 
the amount payable was paid on july  
table of contents income taxes income taxes were million in compared to million in our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the change in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to the difference between the book and tax treatment of incentive stock options and the expenses related to the second contingent payment and third contingent payment pursuant to the securities purchase and redemption agreement which were not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate in differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to incentive stock options and expenses incurred during the year related to the ipo that were not deductible for tax purposes

table of contents historically  we have experienced greater net sales in the second half of the year than those in the first half due to a concentration of shopping during the fall and holiday seasons 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue 
in  approximately of our net sales  of our gross profit and of our income from operations were generated in the second half of the year 
accordingly  our results of operations for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of the effects of seasonality  particularly in preparation for the fall and holiday shopping seasons  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each year 
during these peak periods  we have historically borrowed under our credit facility

liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs are working capital and capital expenditures 
historically  we have generally financed these needs with operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility 
these sources of liquidity may be impacted by fluctuations in demand for our products  ongoing investments in our infrastructure and expenditures on marketing and advertising 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our beginning balance of cash  net cash flows provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities and our ending balance of cash year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year net cash provided by operating activities

we believe that our cash  cash flow from operating activities  available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents indebtedness on august   we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement  or the credit facility  with pnc bank and ups capital corporation  as lenders 
the credit facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to million which may be increased to up to million upon our request subject to certain conditions and expires on august  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the total amount of available borrowings is subject to limitations based on specified percentages of the value of eligible receivables and inventory 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding and we had million of additional availability under the credit facility 
we may request up to two increases in the total maximum available amount of the credit facility from the existing lenders  each in an amount not to exceed million  such that the aggregate amount of the facility does not exceed million 
we are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused credit facility commitments at a per annum rate of 
the credit facility includes restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments  make loans and make capital expenditures  and requires that we maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility of not less than to  measured on a trailing month basis 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in october  we entered into a first amendment and waiver to revolving credit and security agreement  or the amendment 
the amendment increased the amount of allowable capital expenditures to million annually and waived any past non compliance with the capital expenditure covenant 
under the amendment  we may select from two interest rate options for borrowings under the credit facility i alternate base rate as defined in the credit facility plus or ii eurodollar rate as defined in the credit facility plus 
the amendment also allows us to enter into foreign currency contracts with the lenders to hedge our foreign currency risk 
on march   we entered into a second amendment to the revolving credit and security agreement 
the amendment provides for an increase in the permitted aggregate annual capital expenditures to million 
on january   we entered into a third amendment to the revolving credit and security agreement 
the amendment allows for us to buy back up to million of our outstanding common stock 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes  as of december   the total amount of future payments due in various future periods payments due by period total less than one year years years more than five years in thousands operating lease obligations sponsorship agreements other contractual obligations total we lease office space under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain provisions for rental adjustments  including in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
we have contractual relationships with certain of our sponsored athletes  djs  musicians and artists  whereby we compensate them for promoting our products or pay them a royalty on sales of their signature headphones 
sponsorship arrangements are typically structured to give our sponsored team members financial 
table of contents incentives to maintain a highly visible profile with our products 
our contracts typically have a one to three year term  and grant us a license for the use of their names and likenesses  and typically require them to maintain exclusive association with our headphones 
in turn  we agree to make cash payments to our sponsored team members for wearing our products during various public appearances  in magazine shoots and on the podium after certain competitive victories 
in addition to cash payments  we also generally provide limited complimentary products for their use  and reimburse certain travel expenses incurred in conjunction with promoting our products 
our other contractual obligations consist of warehouse distribution services with our third party supply chain providers 
indemnification we agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and could enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum amount that could be payable under these arrangements since these obligations are not capped but are conditional to the unique facts and circumstances involved 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported net sales and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition and sales returns and allowances net sales are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the retailer or distributor and when collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  we extend credit to our retailers and distributors and do not require collateral 
our payment terms are typically net with terms up to net for certain international customers 
we recognize revenue net of estimated product returns and pricing adjustments 
further  we provide for product warranties in accordance with the contract terms given to various retailers and end users by accruing estimated warranty costs at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
we have entered into contracts with various retailers granting a conditional right of return allowance with respect to defective products 
the contracts with each retailer specify the defective allowance percentage of gross sales 
we have executed an open return program with a major retailer allowing for an unlimited amount of returns 
estimates for these items are based on actual experience and are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of recognition or when circumstances change resulting in a change in estimated returns 
accounts receivable throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our retailers and distributors  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the retailer s or distributor s current creditworthiness 
we continuously 
table of contents monitor our collections and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company records a specific reserve for individual accounts when the company becomes aware of a customer s likely inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customer change  the company would further adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
bad debt expense is reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  our losses associated with uncollectible accounts have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our retailers or distributors could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of the cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
substantially all of our inventory is comprised of finished goods 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  reduced consumer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and market value could be inaccurate  which could result in excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets we review property and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if property  plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value 
we did not record any impairments during  and prior to the acquisitions of astro gaming  inc in april and kungsbacka ab in august  we did not have goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we perform our goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in  and we amortize our intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and review these assets for impairment 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging between three to eight years 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary 
assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized  valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets  which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made 
income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions  or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we account for all stock based compensation awards to employees using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the requisite service period 
option awards issued to non employees excluding non employee directors are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance  are periodically revalued at each reporting date  and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions including expected term  volatility  expected dividend  risk free interest rate  forfeiture rate and the fair value of our common stock 
these assumptions generally require significant judgment 
we estimate the expected term of employee options using the average of the time to vesting and the contractual term 
we derive our expected volatility from the historical volatilities of several public companies within our industry because we have little information on the volatility of the price of our common stock since we have no trading history prior to our ipo on july  when making the selections of our industry peer companies to be used in the volatility calculation  we also considered the stage of development  size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies 
these historical volatilities are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 
our expected dividend rate is zero  as we have never paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each grant s expected life 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs for future grants 
these changes  if any  may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future  and to the extent that we do  our actual stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase 
performance based restricted stock units psus vest subject to the achievement of certain predetermined performance goals and employment over the requisite service period 
if a performance goal is not met or is not expected to be met  we do not recognize expense on the number of the psus that are not expected to vest  and we reverse any previously recognized compensation expense on those psus in the period that expectations change 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain a credit facility that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit of up to million which may be increased to up to million upon our request subject to certain conditions 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding and we had million of additional availability under the credit facility 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity 
based on the average interest rate on the credit facility as of december   and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding  we do not believe that a change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that could impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales and expenses of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
changes in foreign currency rates affect our consolidated statement of operations and distort comparisons between periods 
we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the translation of operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on a quarterly basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
derivatives that do not qualify or are no longer deemed effective to qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
the net fair value of foreign currency forward contracts including adjustments for credit risk as of december  was a liability of million compared to an asset of million as of december  
table of contents the potential decrease in fair value of foreign currency forward contracts excluding adjustments for credit risk  assuming a adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  would be approximately million as of december  compared with a decrease of approximately million as of december  if adjustments for credit risk were to be included  the decrease would be smaller 
inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs  may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
outstanding orders we typically receive the bulk of our orders from retailers approximately three weeks prior to the date the products are to be shipped and from distributors approximately six weeks prior to the date the products are to be shipped 
generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
retailers regularly request reduced order lead time  which puts pressure on our supply chain 
our open order book varies by season  with the highest level occurring during the fourth quarter
