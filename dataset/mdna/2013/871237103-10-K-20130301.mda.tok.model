however  there can be no assurance that such facility will be available to us  even though it is a binding commitment of the financial institutions 
the credit agreement will mature on may  borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at either libor or the base rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
the applicable interest rate will be determined quarterly based on our leverage ratio at such time 
the base rate is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i the rate of interest established by keybank  from time to time  as its prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time  plus of per annum  and iii the then applicable libor rate for one month interest periods  plus 
swingline loans will bear interest only at the base rate plus the base rate margin 
in addition  we are required to pay certain customary fees  including a commitment fee of  which is due quarterly in arrears and calculated on the average unused amount of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct and indirect material us subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of of the non voting and of the voting capital stock of all of our direct foreign subsidiaries and those of the guarantors 
in april  we received an assessment for the canadian audit for which we filed a notice of objection in july as required by the notice of objection process  we paid mandatory security deposits in the amount of million to the canadian revenue agency and million to the province of ontario 
this process will allow us to submit the case to the us and canada competent authority for ultimate resolution 
although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain  we believe we are adequately reserved for this audit and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
on august   we completed the acquisition of alpine access  inc alpine  a delaware corporation  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  dated july  the purchase price of million was funded through cash on hand of million and borrowings of million under our credit agreement  dated may  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which approximately or million  was held in international operations and is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
these funds may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states  including withholding tax applied by the country of origin and an incremental us income tax  net of allowable foreign tax credits 
there are circumstances where we may be unable to repatriate some of the cash and cash equivalents held by our international operations due to country restrictions 
we do not intend nor currently foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we expect our current domestic cash levels and cash flows from operations to be adequate to meet our domestic anticipated working capital needs  including investment activities such as capital expenditures and debt repayment for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
additionally  we expect our current foreign cash levels and cash flows from foreign operations to be adequate to meet our foreign anticipated working capital needs  including investment activities such as capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
if we should require more cash in the us than is provided by our domestic operations for significant discretionary unforeseen activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases  we could elect to repatriate future foreign earnings and or raise capital in the u 
s through additional borrowings or debt equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  interest expense and or dilution of earnings 
we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow additional funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 
our cash resources could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  the risks detailed in item a  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years other operating leases purchase obligations accounts payable accrued employee compensation and benefits income taxes payable other accrued expenses and current liabilities long term debt long term tax liabilities other long term liabilities amounts represent the expected cash payments under our operating leases 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
accounts payable and accrued employee compensation and benefits see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which represent amounts due vendors and employees payable within one year 
income taxes payable  which represents amounts due taxing authorities payable within one year 
other accrued expenses and current liabilities  which exclude deferred grants  include amounts as disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  primarily related to restructuring costs  legal and professional fees  telephone charges  rent  derivative contracts and other accruals 
long term debt see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which represents borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
long term tax liabilities include uncertain tax positions and related penalties and interest as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the amount in the table has been reduced by million of canadian mandatory security deposits paid during  which are included in deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the cash settlement of million of the long term liabilities with the taxing authority  therefore  amounts have been excluded from payments due by period 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes and other non cash long term liabilities  represent the expected cash payments due under restructuring accruals primarily lease obligations and pension obligations 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results 
unless we need to clarify a point to readers  we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing the application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes 
recognition of revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition 
we primarily recognize revenues from services as the services are performed  which is based on either a per minute  per call  per transaction or per time and material basis  under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenues for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of any future product or service or meeting other specified performance conditions 
product sales  accounted for within our fulfillment services  are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
revenues from fulfillment services account for  and of total consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  some of which contain multiple deliverables 
the service offerings for these fulfillment service contracts typically include pick pack and ship  warehousing  process management  finished goods assembly and pass through costs 
in accordance with asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc as amended by accounting standards update asu revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu  we determine if the services provided under these contracts with multiple deliverables represent separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value  and where return rights exist  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control 
if those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting  revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement 
if those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting  revenue for the delivered services are bundled into a single unit of accounting and recognized on the proportional performance method using the straight line basis over the contract period  or the actual number of operational seats used to serve the client  as appropriate 
as a result of the adoption of asu  the company allocates revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence  and then estimated selling price 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately 
third party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies  service offerings  and customer classifications 
once we allocate revenue to each deliverable  we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
as of december   our fulfillment contracts with multiple deliverables met the separation criteria as outlined in asc and the revenue was accounted for accordingly 
other than these fulfillment contracts  we have no other contracts that contain multiple deliverables as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  million as of december   or of trade account receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses  including credit risk measurement tools and methodologies using the publicly available credit and capital market information  a review of the current status of our trade accounts receivable and historical collection experience of our clients 
it is reasonably possible that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments 
income taxes we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
establishment or reversal of certain valuation allowances may have a significant impact on both current and future results 
as of december   we determined that a total valuation allowance of million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million as of december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
a provision for income taxes has not been made for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million as of december   as the earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign business operations 
if these earnings are repatriated or otherwise become taxable in the u 
s  we would be subject to an incremental us tax expense net of any allowable foreign tax credits  in addition to any applicable foreign withholding tax expense 
determination of any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature is not practicable 
in april  we received an assessment for the canadian audit for which we filed a notice of objection in july as required by the notice of objection process  we paid mandatory security deposits in the amount of million to the canadian revenue agency and million to the province of ontario  which are included in deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  and cash paid during period for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  this process will allow us to submit the case to the us and canada competent authority for ultimate resolution 
although the outcome of examinations by taxing authorities is always uncertain  we believe we are adequately reserved for this audit and that resolution is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the us department of the treasury released the general explanations of the administration s fiscal year revenue proposals in february these proposals represent a significant shift in international tax policy  which may materially impact us taxation of international earnings 
we continue to monitor these proposals and are currently evaluating their potential impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  the american taxpayer relief act of was passed on january   with many provisions retroactively effective to january  we are currently evaluating the net retroactive impact of this law change on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we evaluate tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in our tax returns  and record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
first  tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  the tax position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  a net decrease of million from million as of december  had we recognized these tax benefits  approximately million and million and the related interest and penalties would favorably impact the effective tax rate in and  respectively 
we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to million due to expiration of statutes of limitations  audit or appeal resolution in various tax jurisdictions 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and is impacted by the distribution of earnings in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate could be impacted by earnings being either proportionally lower or higher in foreign countries where we have tax rates lower than the us tax rates 
in addition  we have been granted tax holidays in several foreign tax jurisdictions  which have various expiration dates ranging from through if we are unable to renew a tax holiday in any of these jurisdictions  our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted 
in some cases  the tax holidays expire without possibility of renewal 
in other cases  we expect to renew these tax holidays  but there are no assurances from the respective foreign governments that they will permit a renewal 
our effective tax rate could also be affected by several additional factors  including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  changing legislation  regulations  and court interpretations that impact tax law in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as new requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge  or loss  to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued asu balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the amendments in asu will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial and derivative instruments that are either offset netting assets and liabilities in accordance with section or section of the fasb accounting standards codification or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those years 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the adoption of asu as of january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the amendments in asu provide entities with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
under the amendments in asu  an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of asu on january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
the amendments in asu do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
us healthcare reform acts in march  the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act the acts 
the acts contain provisions that could materially impact our healthcare costs in the future  thus adversely affecting our profitability 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the acts on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar usd are translated into our usd consolidated financial statements 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
we employ a foreign currency risk management program that periodically utilizes derivative instruments to protect against unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange fx rates 
option and forward derivative contracts are used to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and other transactions initiated in the united states  that are denominated in a foreign currency 
additionally  we may employ fx contracts to hedge net investments in foreign operations 
we serve a number of us based clients using customer contact management center capacity in the philippines  canada and costa rica  which are within our americas segment 
although the contracts with these clients are priced in usds  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  canadian dollars  and costa rican colones crc  which represent fx exposures 
additionally  our emea segment services clients in hungary and romania where the contracts are priced in euros eur  with a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts denominated in hungarian forints huf and romanian leis ron 
in order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in php  crc  huf and ron we had outstanding forward contracts and options as of december  with counterparties through january with notional amounts totaling million 
as of december   we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of million  which will settle within the next months 
if the usd was to weaken against the php  crc and the eur was to weaken against the huf and ron by from current period end levels  we would incur a loss of approximately million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
we also entered into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect against fx volatility pertaining to intercompany receivables and payables  and other assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was a net receivable of million 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for these contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into contracts with those considered to have minimal credit risk 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency services substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base rates 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended december   a one point increase in the weighted average interest rate  which generally equals the libor rate plus an applicable margin  would have had a million impact on our results of operations 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
