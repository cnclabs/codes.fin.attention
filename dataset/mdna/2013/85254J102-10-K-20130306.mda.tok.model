item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the combined financial information presented for periods on or prior to april  relate solely to the stag predecessor group 
the consolidated financial statements for the period april  to december  and the year ended december  include the financial information of our company  our operating partnership and our subsidiaries 
where the company is referenced in comparisons of financial results between the year ended december  and and any quarter or period ended in  the financial information for such quarter or period ended in or prior to april  relates solely to the stag predecessor group  notwithstanding company being the reference 
overview we are a fully integrated  full service real estate company focused on the acquisition  ownership and management of single tenant industrial properties throughout the united states 
as of december   we owned properties in states with approximately million rentable square feet  consisting of warehouse distribution properties  light manufacturing properties and flex office properties  and our properties were leased to tenants  with no single tenant accounting for more than of our total annualized rent and no single industry accounting for more than of our total annualized rent 
we were formed as a maryland corporation on july  and our operating partnership  of which we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  stag industrial gp  llc  are the sole general partner  was formed as a delaware limited partnership on december  on april   we closed on formation transactions and became a public company 
at december   we owned a limited partnership interest in our operating partnership 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit under the code  and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a reit 
factors that may influence future results of operations outlook the lack of speculative development generally across the country and specifically in our markets may improve occupancy levels and rental rates in our owned portfolio 
in addition  our acquisition activity is expected to enhance our overall financial performance 
the continuation of low interest rates combined with the availability of attractively priced properties should allow us to deploy our capital on an attractive spread investing basis 
in general  the economic environment for our tenants appears to be improving due in particular to the increasing availability of financing accessible by mid sized companies 
revenue we receive income primarily from rental revenue from our properties 
the amount of rental revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space 
as of december   our properties were approximately leased 
the amount of rental revenue generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 
future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of tenant bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties 

table of contents certain leases entered into by us contain tenant concessions 
any such rental concessions are accounted for on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
on october   we acquired industrial properties representing million square feet for a purchase price of million from fund ii  a related party of our company through common mannagement 
on october   we acquired one additional industrial property from fund ii for a purchase price of million 
we expect the addition of the properties will impact our overall performance in future periods 
additionally  during the year ended december  we recognized asset management fee income of million related to the management services our subsidiary  stag industrial management  llc  performed for fund ii 
the asset management fee will decrease in future periods as a result of the sale of the fund ii assets to our company 
scheduled lease expirations our ability to re lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties 
as of december   we had approximately million rentable square feet of currently available space in our properties 
for the year ended december   we have achieved an tenant retention rate for those tenants whose leases were scheduled to expire in conditions in our markets the properties in our portfolio are located in markets throughout the united states 
positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets may affect our overall performance 
rental expenses our rental expenses generally consist of utilities  real estate taxes  management fees  insurance and site repair and maintenance costs 
for the majority of our tenants  our rental expenses are controlled  in part  by the triple net provisions in tenant leases 
in our triple net leases  the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the property and its operation during the lease term  including utilities  taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
however  we also have modified gross leases and gross leases in our property portfolio 
the terms of those leases vary and on some occasions we may absorb property related expenses of our tenants 
in our modified gross leases  we are responsible for some property related expenses during the lease term  but the cost of most of the expenses is passed through to the tenant for reimbursement to us 
in our gross leases  we are responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the property and its operation during the lease term 
our overall performance will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass through rental expenses to our tenants 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical 
table of contents in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements the adoption of new accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position during the year ended decemember  use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
rental property and depreciation real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the cost of real estate includes the purchase price of the property and leasehold improvements 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
significant renovations and betterments that extend the economic useful lives of assets are capitalized 
we evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible real estate assets held for use for possible impairment when an event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset and the ultimate sale of the asset 
if such cash flows are less than the asset carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the asset carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and such estimates could differ from actual results 
for properties considered held for sale  we cease depreciating the properties and value the properties at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  less costs to dispose 
we classify properties as held for sale when all criteria within the fasb accounting standard codification asc  property  plant and equipment are met 
we present qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property net income loss are reflected as discontinued operations include operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
expenditures for tenant improvements  leasehold improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized or depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the terms of each specific lease 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method based on the following useful lives buildings years building and land improvements years tenant improvements shorter of useful life or terms of related lease we evaluate acquisitions to determine if the acquisition represents an asset acquisition or business combination  and we account for all business combinations in accordance with asc  business combinations 
upon acquisition of a property  we allocate the purchase price of the property based 
table of contents upon the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  which generally consist of land  buildings  tenant improvements and intangible assets including in place leases  above market and below market leases and tenant relationships  as well as the fair value of debt assumed 
we allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
acquired above and below market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases that are considered bargain renewal options 
the above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases 
the purchase price is further allocated to in place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
the value of in place lease intangibles and tenant relationships  which are included as components of deferred leasing intangibles  are amortized over the remaining lease term and expected renewal periods of the respective lease for tenant relationships as adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense 
if a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of leasing commissions  above and below market leases  the in place lease value and tenant relationships are immediately written off 
in determining the fair value of the debt assumed  we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on a current market rate 
the associated fair market value debt adjustment is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt 
using information available at the time of acquisition  we allocate the total consideration to tangible assets and liabilities and identified intangible assets and liabilities 
we may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocations after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
tenant accounts receivable  net tenant accounts receivable  net on the consolidated balance sheets  includes both tenant accounts receivable  net and accrued rental income  net 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of tenant accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible 
we accrue rental revenue earned  but not yet receivable  in accordance with gaap 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from those revenues 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and accrued rental revenue 
goodwill the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill represents amounts allocated to the assembled workforce from the acquired management company 
goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we take a qualitative approach to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test 

table of contents use of derivative financial instruments we follow asc  derivatives and hedging for disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
further  qualitative disclosures are required that explain our objectives and strategies for using derivatives  as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting in accordance with the fasb fair value measurement guidance  we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting arrangements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio 
credit risk is the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract 
we minimize the credit risk in an interest rate swap by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties 
our exposure to credit risk at any point is generally limited to amounts recorded as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  tenant accounts receivable  interest rate swaps  accounts payable  other accrued expenses  unsecured credit facility  unsecured term loans and mortgage notes payable 
the fair values of the cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  tenant accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued expenses approximate their carrying or contract values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
we adopted the fair value measurement provisions for its financial instruments recorded at fair value 
the guidance establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
revenue recognition all current leases are classified as operating leases and rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease when collectability is reasonably assured 
differences between rental revenue earned and amounts due under the lease are charged or credited  as applicable  
table of contents to accrued rental revenue 
additional rents from expense reimbursements for insurance  real estate taxes and certain other expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
early lease termination fees are recorded in rental income on a straight line basis from the notification date of such termination to the then remaining not the original lease term  if any  or upon collection if collection is not reasonably assured 
we earn revenue from asset management fees  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations in other income 
we recognize revenue from asset management fees when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable 
by the terms of their leases  certain tenants are obligated to pay directly the costs of their properties insurance  real estate taxes and certain other expenses and these costs are not reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements 
to the extent any tenant responsible for these costs under its respective lease defaults on its lease or it is deemed probable that the tenant will fail to pay for such costs  we would record a liability for such obligation 
we do not recognize recovery revenue related to leases where the tenant has assumed the cost for real estate taxes  insurance  ground lease payments  and certain other expenses 
gain on sales of real estate gain on sales of real estate is recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc  real estate sales 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc related to the terms of the transaction and continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met  we defer some or all of the gain recognition and accounts for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  leasing  profit sharing  deposit  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
income taxes prior to the ipo  our predecessor was comprised primarily of limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
under applicable federal and state income tax rules  the allocated share of net income or loss from the limited partnerships and limited liability companies was reportable in the income tax returns of the respective partners and members 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december  and intend to continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of its reit taxable income to its stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the code relating to such matters as operating results  asset holdings  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership 
we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to its stockholders that we derive from its reit qualifying activities 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and are unable to avail itself of certain savings provisions set forth in the code  all of our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  including any applicable alternative minimum tax 
we will not be required to make distributions with respect to income derived from the activities conducted through subsidiaries that we elect to treat as taxable reit subsidiaries trs for federal income tax purposes 
certain activities that we undertake must be conducted by a trs  such as performing non customary services for our tenants and holding assets that we cannot hold directly 
a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes 
we currently have no liabilities for uncertain tax positions

interest rate risk asc  derivatives and hedging  requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss  which is a component of equity 
the ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
as of december   we had approximately million of 
table of contents mortgage debt subject to an interest rate swap with such interest rate swap liability having an approximate million net fair value 
stag predecessor group and the other entities that contributed to our formation transactions did not designate the hedges at the time of inception as it was prior to our ipo and reporting in conformity with gaap 
therefore  our investment in the interest rate swap through its expiration on january  did not qualify as an effective hedge for accounting purposes  and as such  changes in the swaps fair market values were being recorded in earnings through the maturity on january  on september   we commenced a program of utilizing designated derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of the unsecured term loan 
we entered into seven interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts varying from million to million with a total notional amount of million with an effective date of october  the swaps convert the one month libor rate on million of the million unsecured term loan due on september   from a variable rate of one month libor plus a spread of to based on our consolidated leverage ratio to a fixed rates between and plus a spread of to based on our consolidated leverage ratio

as of december   we had million of debt with interest at a variable rate

the remaining million of variable rate debt is related to the unsecured credit facility and the remaining million of variable rate debt released to the unsecured term loan  which are both currently priced at one month libor plus 
to the extent interest rates increase  interest costs on our variable rate debt also will increase  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts  including swaps  caps and floors 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets  thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
inflation the majority of our leases is either triple net or provides for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses 
in addition  most of the leases provides for fixed rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations 
non gaap financial measures in this report  we disclose and discuss ffo  which meets the definition of a non gaap financial measure set forth in item e of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
as a result we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of this measure provides useful information to investors 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our performance  and we believe that to understand our performance further  ffo should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in our consolidated and combined financial statements 

table of contents funds from operations we calculate ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
we also believe that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
other equity reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition as we do  and  accordingly  our ffo may not be comparable to such other reits ffo 
ffo should not be used as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the primary market risk we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
we have used derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings  primarily through interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the unsecured credit facility and million of borrowings outstanding under the unsecured term loan bearing interest at a variable rate 
of the million outstanding under the unsecured term loan  million was subject to interest rate swaps effective october  to the extent we undertake variable rate indebtedness  if interest rates increase  then so will the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts  including swaps  caps and floors 
while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us  they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform  we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements  the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in asc  derivatives and hedging 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets  thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
if interest rates increased by basis points and assuming we had outstanding balances of million on the unsecured credit facility and million on the unsecured term loan the portion not subject to interest rate swaps for the entire year ended december   our interest expense would have increased by million for the year ended december  as of december   approximately million of our consolidated borrowings bore interest at fixed rates including million of swapped interest rates under the unsecured term loan  as shown in the table below dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands secured mortgage notes payable fixed rate average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate total debt amounts include variable interest rate payments on the million of the million unsecured term loan that have been swapped to a fixed rate 

table of contents as of december   we were party to the interest rate swaps shown in the table below dollars in thousands with a total fair value liability of million 
derivative instrument trade date notional amount fixed interest rate variable interest rate maturity date interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  interest rate swap sept  one month libor september  we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of the swap depends heavily on the current market fixed rate  the corresponding term structures of variable rates and the expectation of changes in future variable rates 
as expectations of future variable rates increase  the market value of the interest rate swap increases 
as of december   all of our interest rate swaps were effectively hedged  therefore  the changes in the fair value of derivatives was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
during the year ended december   we did not record any hedge ineffectiveness related to the hedged derivatives 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
interest risk amounts are our management estimates and were determined by considering the effect of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
