item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company overview we are a leading international provider of cost effective systems and solutions that address the mass transit and global defense markets most pressing and demanding requirements 
we are engaged in the design  development  manufacture  integration  and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products 
we also provide a broad range of engineering  training  technical  logistic  and information technology services 
we serve the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and allied nations around the world with products and services that have both defense and civil applications 
our main areas of focus are in mass transit automated fare payment and revenue management infrastructure  defense  intelligence  homeland security  and information technology  including cyber security 
for the fiscal year ended september   of sales were derived from transportation systems and related services  while were derived from defense systems and services 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in  of sales in  and of sales in in fiscal year  of our total sales were derived from services  with product sales accounting for the remaining 
we operate in three reportable business segments transportation systems  mission support services and defense systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
we are operating in an environment that is characterized by continuing economic pressures in the us and globally 
a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution  improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services  and providing opportunities for customers to outsource services where we can provide a lower cost and more effective solution 
recognizing that many of our us based customers are resource constrained  we are continuing our focus on developing and extending our portfolio in international and adjacent markets 
our international sales  including foreign military sales fms  comprised of our total sales for fiscal year international sales from cubic transportation systems cts amounted to of total cts sales for fiscal year international sales from mission support services mss comprised of total mss sales for fiscal year international sales from cubic defense system cds amounted to of total cds sales for fiscal year to the extent our business and contracts include operations in foreign countries  other risks are introduced into our business  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries  and the potential for deterioration of political relations 
we expect sales from domestic cts contracts to increase as a percentage of total cts sales in  as we begin to realize revenues from a major contract with the chicago transit authority 
however  we expect international sales from cds to increase in future periods due to the number of international opportunities we are currently pursuing 
we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development r d activities  and through acquisitions 
company sponsored r d spending totaled million in we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
in pursuing our business strategy  we routinely conduct discussions  evaluate targets  and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to identify acquisition opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services  or customer base  at attractive valuations 
we have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses during the past several years  including abraxas corporation in december  nek special programs group  llc nek in december and nextbus  inc in january generally  these acquisitions are dilutive to earnings in the short term due to acquisition related costs  integration costs  retention payments and often higher amortization of purchased intangibles in the early periods after acquisition 
however  we expect that each of these recent acquisitions will be accretive to earnings in the long term 
industry considerations the us government continues to focus on discretionary spending  entitlements  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the economy  create jobs  and reduce the deficit 
the current presidential administration and congress will likely continue to debate the size and expected growth of the us federal budget as well as the defense budget over the next few years and balance decisions regarding defense  homeland security  and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment imposed by the budget control act of budget act  which  in part  reduces defense spending by a minimum of billion over a ten year period that began in fiscal year 
table of contents on march   the sequestration of appropriations in fiscal year imposed by the budget act was implemented by the federal government 
while the ultimate effects of sequestration still cannot be determined  these reductions have had an impact upon our customers procurement of products and services and will continue to have significant impact on the defense industry 
these budgetary considerations may also impact funding to our us mass transit customers from the federal government for large infrastructure projects 
while these budgetary considerations have put downward pressure on growth in the defense industry and will likely continue to do so  we believe that much of our business is well positioned in areas that the us department of defense dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending to help the dod meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting us security and the security of our allies in the years to come 
in addition  our defense business has an immaterial amount of exposure to overseas contingency operations 
in transportation  we continue to believe that our products and services are critical to our customers to ensure that they maximize revenue and efficiencies in fare collection in a resource constrained environment 
some customers have responded to the current market environment by seeking financing for their projects from the system supplier 
an example of this is our contract with the chicago transit authority  awarded in late we are designing and manufacturing a new fare collection system for the chicago transit authority and will receive monthly payments for the system over an approximate ten year period expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal while future defense plans  changes in defense spending levels and changes in spending for mass transit projects could have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  we have and plan to continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions to align our businesses in growth areas of our respective markets that we believe are the most critical priorities and mission areas for our customers 
segment overview cubic transportation systems cts is a systems integrator that develops and provides fare collection infrastructure  services and technology and real time passenger information systems and services for public transportation authorities and operators worldwide 
we offer fare collection devices  software  systems and multiagency  multimodal integration technologies  as well as a full suite of operational services that help agencies efficiently collect fares  manage operations  reduce revenue leakage and make public transit more convenient 
the public transportation markets we serve are undergoing a substantial change 
mounting pressure on public transportation authorities to stretch their operating budgets is fueling a trend toward outsourced services and payment systems that lower operating cost 
we believe we are positioned at the forefront of this change 
we provide a wide range of services for public transportation authorities in major markets worldwide  including computer hosting services  call center and web services  payment media issuance and distribution services  retail point of sale network management  payment processing  financial clearing and settlement  software application support and outsourced asset operations and maintenance 
significant regions where we currently provide services include london  sydney  brisbane  sweden  washington dc  los angeles  san francisco and atlanta 
cts operates full service operation centers in north america  europe and australia 
in  revenues from services provided by cts were million  or of cts sales in cts is a prime contractor and has active projects worldwide  including in the new york metrocard new jersey patco  path smartlink region  chicago ventra  vancouver  sydney opal  brisbane go card  the frankfurt rmv region  sweden  the washington  dc maryland virginia region smartrip  the los angeles region  the san diego region  miami  minneapolis st 
paul and atlanta 
in addition to helping us secure similar projects in new markets  our comprehensive suite of new technologies and capabilities enable us to benefit from a recurring stream of revenues in established markets resulting from innovative new services  technology obsolescence  equipment refurbishment and the introduction of new or adjacent applications 
we are currently designing and building major new systems in chicago  sydney and vancouver 
typically  profit margins during the design and build phase of major projects are lower than during the operate and maintain phase 
this has in the past caused  and may in the future cause  swings in profitability from period to period 
in addition  cash flows are often negative during portions of the design and build phase  until major milestones are reached and cash payments are received 
this was the case in  as we experienced negative cash flows from all three of these major projects 
each of these projects includes a ten year operate and maintain period and we expect cash flows from these projects to be positive in future years 

table of contents cash payment terms offered by our mass transit customers in a competitive environment are sometimes not favorable to us 
the customers budget constraints often result in less funding available for the build of a new system  with more funds becoming available when the system becomes operational 
this  coupled with the inherent risks in managing large infrastructure projects  can yield negative cash flows and lower and less predictable profit margins on contracts during the design and build phase 
conversely  during the operate and maintain phase  revenues and costs are typically more predictable and profit margins tend to be higher 
gross profit margins from services sales in cts were and for fiscal years and  respectively  and gross profit margin from product sales was and in and  respectively 
thus  the trend toward more services revenues has helped to generate higher profit margins from the segment in recent years than in the past 
the mix of product and services sales can produce fluctuations in margin from period to period  however  we expect the trend of increasing services sales to continue in the next several years 
most of our sales in cts for fiscal year were from fixed price contracts 
however  some of our service contracts provide for variable payments  in addition to the fixed payments  based on meeting certain service level requirements and  in some cases  based on system usage 
service level requirements are generally contingent upon factors that are under our control  while system usage payments are contingent upon factors that are generally not under our control  other than basic system availability 
development and system integration contracts in cts are usually accounted for on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion  which requires us to estimate our costs to complete these contracts on a regular basis 
our actual results can vary significantly from these estimates and changes in estimates can result in significant swings in revenues and profitability from period to period 
generally  we are at risk for increases in our costs  unless an increase results from customer requested changes 
at times  there can be disagreement with a customer over who is responsible for increases in costs 
in these situations we must use judgment to determine if it is probable that we will recover our costs and any profit margin 
revenue under contracts for services in cts is generally recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  and may vary from period to period 
incentive fees included in some of our cts service contracts are recognized when they become fixed and determinable based on the provisions of the contract 
as described above  often these fees are based on meeting certain contractually required service levels or based on system usage levels 
contractual terms can also result in variation of both revenues and expenses  resulting in fluctuations in earnings from period to period 
for our contract for the new fare collection system for the chicago transit authority  the contract specifies that we will not be paid until we enter the service period 
in accordance with authoritative accounting literature  we did not begin recognizing revenue on this contract until it entered the service period in august as of september   we had capitalized million in direct costs associated with developing the new fare collection system 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs associated with this contract are not being capitalized  but are being expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are being amortized into cost of sales based upon the ratio of revenue recorded during a period compared to the revenue expected to be recognized over the term of the contract 
in january  we announced the acquisition of nextbus as well as certain contracts from its parent company  webtech wireless 
the purchase consideration was approximately million 
nextbus provides real time passenger information systems using a software as a service solution 
the nextbus acquisition is part our nextcity vision and it expands cts potential market beyond fare collection to information based solutions 
for fiscal year  nextbus had million of revenue and was slightly dilutive to our earnings per share  after consideration of costs for transaction integration  retention and the amortization of purchased intangibles 
on november  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of intelligent transport management solutions limited itms  a wholly owned uk subsidiary of serco limited 
itms is a provider of traffic management systems technology  traffic and road enforcement and maintenance of traffic signals  emergency equipment and other critical road and tunnel infrastructure 
the total acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred for itms was approximately million 
mission support services mss is a leading provider of highly specialized support services to the us government and allied nations 
services provided include live  virtual and constructive training  real world mission rehearsal exercises  professional military education  intelligence support  information technology  information assurance and related cyber support  development of military doctrine  consequence management  infrastructure protection and force protection  as well as support to field operations  force deployment and redeployment and logistics 

table of contents mss is a highly specialized and customer centric business which we believe knows how to meet the unique requirements of each of its many customers 
in the government services marketplace  reputation  quality and relationships are always important 
we uphold our credentials for professional excellence by consistently providing high value and cost effective support for our customers 
mss is focused on customers within the us government  extending to the dod  all branches of the us armed services  the department of homeland security  non military agencies  and allied nations under fms contracts funded by the us government 
mss is the prime contractor at more than military training and support facilities and supports more than  exercises and training events per year 
the segment supports all four of the us army s combat training centers ctcs comprised of the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  louisiana  which is the nation s premier training center for light infantry forces  the national training center ntc in fort irwin  california  the army s premier heavy maneuver ctc  the joint multinational readiness center jmtc in hohenfels  germany  which is the us army europe s combat maneuver training center for realistic training from the individual to the brigade level  and the mission command training program mctp in fort leavenworth  kansas  which delivers mission command training to the army s senior commanders and is the army s only worldwide deployable ctc 
mss continues its role as a long time prime contractor for the marine corps air and ground forces under the marine air ground task force magtf training systems support mtss contract 
under this contract and its two predecessors  mss has been and continues to be the principal us marine corps usmc mission support contractor providing training services since we also currently provide and or have provided defense modernization support for nato entrants in central and eastern europe under fms contracts 
we are adapting to a new era in defense and national security spending practices 
in the past  many of the contracts we were awarded in mss were long term in nature  spanning periods of five to ten years 
the dod now relies heavily upon indefinite delivery indefinite quantity id iq and small business set aside contracts 
for us that means a lower backlog of long term service contracts due to the shorter term nature of these id iq task order awards 
shorter term contracts combined with this tougher competitive environment  where the lowest price technically acceptable bids usually win  have resulted in a trend toward lower profit margins from the segment in recent periods 
for example  the gross profit margin in mss was in and compared to in threats related to sequestration and margin compression were among the factors that resulted in a decline in the estimated fair value of mss and a resulting million goodwill impairment in we must continue to work to keep our costs low to remain competitive under these market conditions 
these conditions also provide the opportunity for us to increase our market share of the large dod services market 
to maximize our business opportunities under id iq contract vehicles  we often seek new work both as a prime contractor and a subcontractor 
by increasing our participation in multiple award id iq contracts we improve our chances to develop new customers  programs and capabilities 
retaining customers is a critical component of our success  we remain vigilant in maintaining a high win rate on re compete contracts to retain our customers 
despite the trend toward small business awards by the us government  where we must take a role as a subcontractor  of our revenues in fiscal year were as a prime contractor 
mss expanded and deepened its training services through the acquisition of omega training group in  which positioned the segment at key locations  such as fort lee  virginia  fort bliss  texas  and fort benning  georgia  which were recipients of work from the base realignment and closure brac 
in addition  mss has been focused on diversifying its business over the last three years to the national security market 
the acquisition of abraxas in fiscal year  and nek in december  adds to the segment s specialized skills and further diversifies the business to new customers and markets which are directly aligned with dod s emphasis on intelligence and the special operations forces communities where trusted credentials are a high barrier to entry 
nek provides special forces training related services to the us army and other national security related customers  and we expect nek to provide a platform to expand mss work both in the us and to key foreign allies 
we acquired select assets of nek for approximately million in total consideration 
as part of the acquisition  we hired more than employees with substantial experience in the special forces community 
for fiscal year  nek was slightly dilutive to our earnings per share after consideration of costs for transaction integration  retention  and the amortization of purchased intangibles 
in fiscal year  we anticipate that this acquisition should be accretive  and that nek should contribute million to million in sales 
cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts accounted for of our sales in mss for fiscal year  with the remaining sales derived from fixed price contracts 
revenues under cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred  plus the estimated fee earned under the contract terms 
often these are structured as award fees based on performance and are generally accrued during the performance of the contract based on our historical experience with such awards 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recognized as services are delivered based on the terms of the contract 
revenues under our fixed price service contracts with the us government are recorded under the cost to cost percentage of completion method 

table of contents cubic defense systems cds is focused on two primary lines of business training systems and secure communications 
the segment is a diversified supplier of live and virtual military training systems  and secure communication systems and products to the dod  other us government agencies and allied nations 
we design and manufacture instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our secure communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  asset tracking and search and rescue markets 
cds is building upon its role as a leader in air and ground combat training systems worldwide 
our products and systems help our customers to retain technological superiority with cost effective solutions 
we design  innovate  manufacture and field a diverse range of technologies that are critical to combat readiness  supply chain logistics and national security for the us and allied nations 
our primary lines of business include air combat training ranges and after action review software  ground combat training systems  including a full range of laser engagement simulation systems  virtual small arms training systems  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr data links  personnel locator systems  multi band communication tracking devices and cross domain appliances for cyber security 
we also provide ongoing support services for systems we have built for several of our international customers 
our established international footprint in more than allied nations is a key ingredient to our strategy 
our global footprint helps to insulate us from possible shifts or downturns in dod spending 
sales from international customers of cds have become a major part of our business with million  or of sales  in from international customers 
in addition  expansion into adjacent markets gives us an effective means to add scale to our business 
we look for attractive acquisition candidates to expand our product offerings and we invest in the development of innovative new products that deliver real value to our customers 
through acquisitions made in  and our additional investment in product development  we now supply asset visibility solutions for military and commercial supply chain logistics 
this includes container tracking  yard management and shipment monitoring 
in  we also acquired cyber products that include a range of certified and accredited cross domain transfer appliances that ensure secure and appropriate access to data and services from unclassified to top secret for defense  intelligence and homeland security customers 
we have delivered training and simulation offerings to seven nations in the asia pacific region and have positioned ourselves for certain anticipated contracts with the australian defense forces 
through business acquisitions we made in we now offer live fire training solutions to us and international forces  further deepening our training capabilities and expanding our customer base  and we acquired a specialist engineering business with strong project management competencies in training range design  operations  communications  and safety requirements 
fixed price contracts accounted for of cds revenue for fiscal year development and system integration contracts in cds are generally accounted for on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion  which requires us to estimate our costs to complete these contracts on a regular basis 
our actual results can vary significantly from these estimates and changes in estimate can result in significant swings in revenues and profitability from period to period 
generally  we are at risk for increases in our costs  unless an increase results from customer requested changes 
at times  there can be disagreement with a customer over who is responsible for increases in costs 
in these situations we must use judgment to determine if it is probable that we will recover our costs and any profit margin 
cds also has many long term  fixed price production contracts that do not require substantial development effort 
for these contracts we use the units of delivery percentage of completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
increasingly  cds is receiving contracts from foreign customers to not only develop and deliver a system  but to maintain the system for a period of years after the delivery 
while service contracts have not historically been a significant part of our cds business  this type of multiple element contract has become more common in recent years 
revenues under contracts for services in cds are generally recognized as services are performed on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  and may vary from period to period  resulting in fluctuations in earnings 
gross profit margins from cds were higher in and than in previous periods primarily due to favorable profit margins from certain foreign contracts 
the gross profit margin in fiscal was  compared to in and in while we expect to win significant new work in foreign markets in the future  we do not expect gross profit margins to match levels 
we expect the gross profit margin to average to in the next several years 
at times  particularly favorable or unfavorable contracts can cause variation in this ratio  due to competition and the prevalence of fixed price arrangements 
fixed price contracts create both the risk of cost growth and the opportunity to increase margins if we are able to reduce our costs 

table of contents in january  we were notified that we had been selected as a single source awardee on three id iq contracts aggregating million from the us navy 
we expect the period of performance to be over five years for these contracts  which involve developing virtual training related technology and curriculum for the us navy littoral combat ships 
comparison of fiscal years ended september  and and september  and operating overview sales in were billion compared to billion in  a decrease of 
decreases in sales for mss of were partially offset by a increase in cts sales  while cds sales were essentially flat 
consolidated sales in would have decreased by without the addition of nek  nextbus and two smaller businesses that were acquired during the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar resulted in a decrease in sales of million in over sales increased in fiscal over  primarily due to sales growth of in cts 
the growth in sales from mss was nearly offset by a decrease in cds sales 
sales increased to billion in  compared to billion in  with all of the growth coming from existing businesses 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in sales of million in over see the segment discussions below for further information about segment sales 
operating income was million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
operating income and operating margin percentages decreased in all three of our business segments 
decreased operating profits on decreased sales in europe  as well as cost growth on contracts in sydney  australia and vancouver  bc canada contributed to the decrease in operating margins for cts 
cds operating profits were negatively impacted in by lower margins on lower sales from a ground training system in the far east  a million write down of inventory in our global asset tracking product line and million of restructuring charges incurred in mss recorded a million goodwill impairment in as discussed in the mss segment disclosures below 
mss also experienced a decrease in gross margins on a decrease in sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of due to lower training activity and continued pressure on bid prices 
mss bid rates have recently been impacted by the tougher competitive environment  where the lowest price technically acceptable bid often wins the contract award 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating income of million for operating income increased to million in compared to million in cts and cds each contributed to the growth in operating income in  while mss operating income was down in from growth in cts sales was the primary reason for the increase in operating income  while cds operating income grew primarily due to a decrease in our investment in cross domain and global asset tracking products in compared to the current competitive environment in the government services industry is driving mss profit margins lower than in recent years  resulting in lower operating income 
operating results for mss include an operating loss from abraxas of million in  including amortization of intangible assets of million  compared to a loss of million in  which included amortization of intangible assets of million and acquisition costs of million 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in operating income of million for see the segment discussions below for further information about segment operating income 
net income attributable to cubic decreased to million per share in from million per share in the decrease in net income attributable to cubic was primarily due to the decrease in operating income as the result of a goodwill impairment charge of million in and an increase in interest expense due to a higher average debt balance in net income attributable to cubic increased to million per share in from million per share in higher net income year over year resulted primarily from the improvements in operating income  as described above 
the gross margin from product sales was in compared to in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to cost growth on transportation contracts in sydney  australia and vancouver  bc canada as well as a change in estimate that had occurred during related to a ground combat training range contract 
prior to we had been working for more than a year under an arrangement without a firm contract price or scope of work and had been recognizing sales equal to costs 
we reached agreement with the customer on a price and scope of work in the third quarter of  resulting in higher sales and operating income of million in because of this favorable change in estimate in declining sales on more profitable cda training system contracts were also responsible for the decrease in the product sales gross margin percentage 
the gross margin from service sales was in compared to in the increase in service gross margin percentage was primarily caused by the change in mix of service sales between segments 
more profitable cts and cda service sales increased in as a percentage of total service sales as compared to a heavier weighting of mss sales as a percentage of service sales in 
table of contents the gross margin from product sales was in  compared to in improved performance from our transportation systems business in in addition to the favorable change in estimate on the cda training system contract described above primarily accounted for the increase 
the gross margin from service sales was in compared to in competitive pressures in the defense services business in contributed to the decrease in gross margin from sg a expenses increased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the increase in sg a expenses in was primarily due to million of stock based compensation recorded as sg a expense during related to our long term equity incentive award program which began in march in addition  million of professional services costs were recognized in the first quarter of related to the restatement of our financial statements for the year ended september  and previous periods 
in addition  we incurred million of expenses in related to our secondary offering of outstanding shares that were sold by certain of our shareholders 
partially offsetting these increases in sg a expenses was a reduction of sg a expenses of million related to proceeds from an insurance claim for losses that we incurred over the period from fiscal to fiscal sg a expenses increased to million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the increase in sg a expenses in reflects the overall growth of the business 
company sponsored r d spending  related primarily to new transportation and defense technologies we are developing  totaled million in compared to million in company sponsored r d spending for cds decreased million in while company sponsored r d spending for cts increased by million in company sponsored r d spending totaled million in compared to million in the increase in r d expenditures in came from the transportation systems business  which increased r d spending from million in to million in a significant portion of our product development spending is incurred in connection with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required engineering and development activity in was approximately million compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales  rather than r d  as they are directly related to contract performance 
amortization expense increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in over and was primarily due to our acquisitions of nek and nextbus in interest and dividend income was million in compared to million in and million in the changes in interest and dividend income between these years were generally correlated with changes in the average cash balances held by our wholly owned subsidiaries in new zealand and australia 
these foreign currency investments earned a higher interest rate than our other cash and short term investments 
other income expense netted to expense of million in compared to income of million in and million in the higher amount of other income in was caused primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on us dollar denominated investments held by our wholly owned subsidiary in the uk that uses the british pound as its functional currency 
the impact of exchange rates on these us dollar denominated investments was recorded as other non operating income  and resulted in income of million in  but did not result in significant income or expense in or interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in was due to an increase in our long term borrowings 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate between and reflects the unfavorable impact related to the goodwill impairment loss  because a large portion of our goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and an increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  as described below 
the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted into law during fiscal year and reinstated the united states federal research and development tax credit retroactively from january  through december  the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects a benefit of million related to fiscal resulting from the retroactive extension of the united states research and development tax credit 
the annual effective tax rate for fiscal only reflected the united states federal research and development credit generated through december   the date on which the credit expired 
as of september   we evaluated our net deferred income tax assets  including an assessment of the cumulative income or loss over the prior three year and future periods by each jurisdiction  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
with respect to australia  a significant negative factor in our assessment at september  was the determination that our australian operations had a three year historical cumulative loss as of the end of the year 
after considering our recent history of losses and future sources of taxable income in the near term  we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets related to australia  with a corresponding charge to our income tax provision  of approximately million in the quarter ended september  we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

table of contents our effective tax rate increased in over  primarily because of the expiration of the united states research and development tax credit on december  and additional tax of million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings 
in addition  fiscal reflected a benefit of million due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions relating to statute expirations and settlements with tax authorities compared to million in fiscal in addition  the fiscal effective tax rate reflected a tax benefit of million related to fiscal resulting from the retroactive extension of the united states federal research and development tax credit 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits and audits of our records by taxing authorities transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions transportation systems sales transportation systems operating income cts sales increased to million in compared to million in cts generated higher sales on a contract for a suburban bus system near chicago  and transit system contracts in minneapolis  new york  and washington d 
c 
nextbus  a business we acquired in january that provides real time passenger information products and services to transit agencies contributed sales of million for the year 
in addition  during fiscal  cts recognized sales of approximately million as a result of a contract claim that was settled related to services that were provided to a european customer between december and the second quarter of fiscal in  cts realized lower sales both from a contract to design and build a system in sydney  australia and due to reduced work on a contract to design and build a system in vancouver  bc canada 
in  revenues were higher on the vancouver and sydney projects as we were producing a significant amount of the hardware for the systems  while in we were moving into in the latter stages of delivery for these systems 
also  during  sales to train operating companies in the uk decreased 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar resulted in a decrease in sales of million for compared to cts sales increased to million in compared to million in the overall increase in sales was primarily from work on our contracts in sydney  australia and vancouver  bc canada 
in addition  sales were somewhat higher from our contracts in the uk partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from design and build projects in the us that were completed in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in a decrease in sales of million for compared to cts operating income decreased in to million compared to million last year 
during operating margins declined due to an increase in estimated costs to complete and implement systems in sydney  australia and vancouver  bc canada 
the increased estimated costs for the sydney contract primarily stems from an increase in estimated costs to install hardware on the customer s transit system bus fleet  while the increased estimated costs on the vancouver contract mainly relates to expected additional system software development costs 
changes in estimated costs on these two contracts decreased operating profit by approximately million in the fourth quarter of  and decreased net income by approximately million per share 
cts operating margins were also affected by a decrease in work on uk development contracts in these decreases in operating income were partially offset by higher operating income on increased work on contracts in the us previously described as well as the sales recorded in the third quarter related to the european service contract claim settlement described above 
in addition  operating income improved on a uk service contract due to higher annual system usage incentives 
the operating loss from nextbus was million for including acquisition related costs of million and amortization of intangible assets of million 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar resulted in a decrease in cts operating income of million for compared to cts operating income improved to million in from million in  an increase of 
improvements in operating income resulted from higher sales in canada and the uk as mentioned above 
in addition  profit margins improved from a service contract in california  where we received higher revenues based on increased system usage 
lower sales in the us from the contracts that were completed in partially offset the growth in operating income  in addition to cost growth of million on contracts in the us and europe 
we also increased research and development spending in to million  compared to million in  which limited growth in operating income 
we are working on next generation transportation technologies that we believe will enhance our leading position in the industry

table of contents mission support services segment years ended september  in millions mission support services sales mission support services operating income loss mss sales decreased to million in compared to million in sales in were lower on certain contracts due to a decrease in activity  including a contract to provide deployment redeployment services and from training contracts for the us military  and lower abraxas sales 
the decrease in sales was also caused by the loss of contracts due to lower bids by competitors 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by sales generated by nek  a special operation forces training business acquired in december that added sales of million for mss sales would have decreased without the acquisition of nek 
the current environment in defense services  including increased competition  an emphasis on small business awards  and the impact of spending cuts from sequestration  has led to contraction in mss operations and may continue to do so in the near term 
mss sales were up to million in compared to million in sales were higher from abraxas in  both due to growth of the business and because we acquired the business during the first quarter of and thus did not realize a full year of sales that year 
sales were also higher from our contract at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  louisiana and from our defense modernization business in eastern europe 
the loss of training work for flight simulators  and at the us army quartermaster center and school  partially offset these sales increases 
mss recorded an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million last year 
the change in the mss operating income loss was primarily related to a million goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual impairment test is performed each year as of july  or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impacts of sequestration and other changes in the business environment did not cause significant impacts on mss until late in during our strategic and financial planning process late in for future years  we made downward revisions in our estimates of future revenues and margins 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we estimated that there was a decline in the estimated fair value of mss  which resulted in the recognition of an impairment of goodwill of million 
excluding the goodwill impairment  in  the decrease in operating income resulted from increased personnel costs on a flight simulator training contract  operating losses at nek and abraxas and the sales decreases described above 
the nek operating loss was million for  including acquisition related costs of million and amortization of intangible assets of million 
abraxas operating loss increased to million in from million in due to decreased activity and lower profit margins 
in addition  mss competitive environment has forced us to bid somewhat lower margins than in recent years in order to acquire positions on new contracts and retain positions on our existing contracts 
mss operating income decreased to million in from million in the loss of the contracts mentioned above contributed to lower operating income in the operating loss from abraxas improved to million in  including amortization of intangible assets of million  compared to million in  which included amortization of intangible assets of million and acquisition costs of million 
amortization of purchased intangibles included in the mss results amounted to million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increases over the three years are due to the acquisitions of nek in december and abraxas in december

in addition  the favorable change in estimate recognized in on a ground combat training range contract discussed in the operating income section below impacted the change in sales between and these decreases in sales were partially offset by increased shipments of miles multiple integrated laser engagement simulation equipment to the us government 
higher sales of air combat training systems also partially offset the overall decrease in training system sales for the year

crds contributed sales of million for the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems sales of million for over training systems sales decreased in to million from million in the delivery of air combat training systems to a us government customer in resulted in significantly higher sales than in in addition  sales from a ground combat training system contract in the far east were lower in than in and shipment of miles equipment to the us government decreased in compared to partially offsetting these decreases were higher sales of our small arms training systems and higher sales from two ground combat training range contracts in europe 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training system sales of million for over operating income for training systems decreased in to million compared to million last year 
the decrease in operating income resulted primarily from a change in estimate that had occurred during related to a ground combat training range contract 
prior to the third quarter of we had been working for more than a year under an arrangement without a firm contract price or scope of work and had been recognizing sales equal to costs 
we reached agreement with the customer on a price and scope of work in the third quarter of  resulting in higher sales and operating income of million for because of this favorable change in estimate 
operating margins also decreased in on the lower sales of ground combat training systems described above  particularly due to decreases in sales to customers in the far east 
these decreases in operating income in were partially offset by higher operating income on increased sales of air combat training systems 
the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems operating income of million for over operating income for training systems was million in and operating income in included the impact of the million favorable change in estimate described above 
offsetting this increase were lower operating profits on lower sales of air combat training systems  a ground combat training system in the far east and miles equipment 
in addition  we incurred higher than previously expected costs in developing an instrumented training system for the us marine corps in the average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the us dollar  resulted in an increase in training systems operating income of million for compared to

restructuring costs in  our cds business implemented a restructuring plan to reduce global employee headcount by approximately in order to rebalance our resources with work levels that have declined due to recent delays in contract awards and contract funding 
cds incurred resulting restructuring charges of million 
the total costs of the restructuring plan are not expected to be significantly greater than the charges incurred to date unless market conditions worsen

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents net income attributable to cubic before interest  taxes  non operating income  goodwill impairment charges  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda included in this report provides useful information to investors with which to analyze our operating trends and performance and ability to service and incur debt 
also  adjusted ebitda is a factor we use in measuring our performance and compensating certain of our executives 
further  we believe adjusted ebitda facilitates company to company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting net interest expense  taxation  the age and book depreciation of property  plant and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense  goodwill impairment charges and non operating expenses which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance 
in addition  we believe that adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies  many of which present an adjusted ebitda measure when reporting their results 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of performance 
in addition  other companies may define adjusted ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to adjusted ebitda of other companies 
furthermore  adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not reflect our provision for income taxes  which may vary significantly from period to period  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on adjusted ebitda

net accounts receivable grew on certain large contracts that we worked on in including transportation contracts in australia and the us in  cash generated by net income was more than offset by increases in accounts receivable of million  long term capitalized construction costs of million  inventories of million  and a net decrease in customer advances of million

our contract terms with our customers can have a significant impact on our cash provided by used in operations 
contract terms  including payment terms on our long term development contracts  are customized for each contract based upon negotiations with the respective customer 
for certain large long term development contracts  we had received significant up front cash payments from customers based upon the negotiated terms of these contracts 
the customer advance balances on these contracts decreased in and as development work progressed 
the customized payment terms on long term development projects also often include payment milestones based upon such items as the delivery of components of systems  meeting specific contractual requirements in the contracts  or other events 
these milestone payments can vary significantly based upon the negotiated terms of the contracts 
in and  the growth in the unbilled accounts receivable was based upon when we are entitled to receive milestone payments

the accumulated deficit in other comprehensive loss decreased million in primarily due to a decrease in the recorded liability for our pension plans of million after applicable income taxes and a net unrealized gain from cash flow hedges of million after applicable income taxes 
these adjustments resulted in a balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at september  compared to million at september  the net deferred tax asset balance was million and million at september  and respectively

the decrease in mss backlog was partially offset by the addition of million of backlog from the acquisition of nek  and the decrease in cts backlog was partially offset by the addition of million of backlog from the acquisition of nextbus 
the increase in cds backlog included over million of contracts with customers in the asia pacific region signed during changes in exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the us dollar as of the end of fiscal  decreased backlog by approximately million compared to september   primarily in our transportation systems segment 
the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear mss service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
funded backlog includes unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress  in the case of us government agencies 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
in addition to the amounts identified above  we have been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
in the past  many of the contracts we were awarded in mss were long term in nature  spanning periods of five to ten years 
the us department of defense now awards shorter term contracts for the services we provide and increasingly relies upon idiq contracts which can result in a lower backlog and or lower funded backlog due to the shorter term nature of task orders issued under these idiq awards 
we also have several service contracts in our transportation business that include contingent revenue provisions tied to meeting certain performance criteria 
these variable revenues are also not included in the amounts identified above 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
asu clarified the intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and added new disclosure requirements related to the unobservable inputs of level measurements and the redemption frequency of level measurements that calculate net asset value per share 
we adopted asu in this adoption had no material impact to our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income oci in the statement of shareholders equity and instead requires net income  the components of oci  and total comprehensive income to be presented in either one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
the standard also requires that items reclassified from oci to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements 
this standard became effective for us in and did not have an effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows as it only required a change in the presentation of oci in our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
prior to the adoption of asu  entities were required to perform a two step impairment test as outlined by the asc 
step one of the two step indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by calculating the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendment  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
an entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none  some or all of its indefinite lived intangible assets 
moreover  an entity can bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test  and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendment is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  accordingly  we adopted this amendment in fiscal year this adoption had no impact to our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  entities are required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  entities are required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail on these amounts 
this standard is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  accordingly we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists which requires companies to present in the financial statements an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward except to the extent such items are not available or not intended to be used at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position 
in such instances  the unrecognized tax benefit is required to be presented in the financial statements as a liability and not be combined with deferred tax assets 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  accordingly  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate 
however  if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products such as mass transit fare collection systems  air and ground combat training systems  and secure communications products 
we provide services such as specialized military training exercises  including live  virtual and constructive training exercises and support  and we operate and maintain fare systems for mass transit customers 
we classify sales as products or services in our consolidated statements of income based on the attributes of the underlying contracts 
a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
many of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver quantities of products over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
for long term fixed price contracts requiring substantial development effort we record revenue on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
for certain other long term  fixed price production contracts not requiring substantial development effort we use the units of delivery percentage of completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
generally  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost method of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under award and incentive fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees and incentives related to performance on contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for long term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
for contracts with the us federal government  general and administrative costs are considered contract costs  however  for purposes of revenue measurement  general and administrative costs are not considered contract costs for any other customers 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  estimated increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
for contract change orders  claims  or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
based upon our history  we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items 
we have accounting policies and controls in place to address these  as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts  and we continue to monitor and improve such policies  controls  and arrangements 
for other information on such policies  controls and arrangements  see our discussion in item a of this form k 
products and services provided under long term  fixed price contracts represented approximately of our sales for because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed price contracts accounted for under the cost to cost percentage of completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 

table of contents we occasionally enter into contracts that include multiple deliverables such as the construction or upgrade of a system and subsequent services related to the delivered system 
recently  we have seen an increase in the number of customer requests for proposal that include this type of contractual arrangement 
an example of this is a contract we entered into in to provide system upgrades and long term services for the vancouver  bc canada smart card and faregate system 
we adopted updated authoritative accounting guidance for multiple element arrangements in on a prospective basis 
for contracts of this nature entered into in and beyond  revenue is allocated at the inception of the contract to the different contract elements based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  which is typically the case for our contracts  the guidance requires us to determine the best estimate of the selling price  which is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold on a standalone basis 
in estimating the selling price of the deliverable on a standalone basis  we consider our overall pricing models and objectives  including the factors we contemplate in negotiating our contracts with our customers 
the pricing models and objectives that we use are generally based upon a cost plus margin approach  with the estimated margin based in part on qualitative factors such as perceived customer pricing sensitivity and competitive pressures 
once the contract value is allocated to the separate deliverables  revenue recognition guidance relevant to each contractual element is followed 
for example  for the long term construction portion of a contract we use the cost to cost percentage of completion method and for the services portion we recognize the service revenues on a straight line basis over the contractual service period or based on measurable units of work performed or incentives earned 
the judgment we apply in allocating the relative selling price to each deliverable can have a significant impact on the timing of recognizing revenues and operating income on a contract 
the revenue recognized for each unit of accounting is classified as products or services sales in our consolidated statements of income based upon the predominant attributes of the unit of accounting 
if product and service deliverables are combined for revenue recognition purposes  revenue recognized is allocated to products or services in our consolidated statements of income based upon a relative selling price method 
for certain of our multiple element arrangements  the contract specifies that we will not be paid upon the delivery of certain units of accounting  but rather we will be paid when subsequent performance obligations are satisfied 
generally  in these cases the allocation of arrangement consideration to the up front deliverables is limited  in some cases to zero  and revenue is reduced  in some cases to zero for the delivery of up front units of accounting 
in such situations  if the costs associated with the delivered item exceed the amount of allocable arrangement consideration  we defer the direct and incremental costs associated with the delivered item that are in excess of the allocated arrangement consideration as capitalized contract costs 
we assess recoverability of these costs by comparing the recorded asset to the deferred revenue in excess of the transaction price allocated to the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
capitalized contract costs are subsequently recognized in income in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition pattern for the arrangement as a whole 
if no pattern of revenue recognition can be reasonably predicted for the arrangement  the capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis 
changes in estimates on contracts for which revenue is recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method decreased operating income by approximately million in  and increased operating income by approximately million in and million in these adjustments decreased net income by approximately million per share in  and increased net income by approximately million per share in and million per share in we provide services under contracts including outsourcing type arrangements and operations and maintenance contracts 
revenue under our service contracts with the us government  which is generally in our mss segment  is recorded under the cost to cost percentage of completion method 
award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts at mss are generally accrued during the performance of the contract based on our historical experience with such awards 
revenue under contracts for services other than those with the us government and those associated with long term development projects is recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
these types of service contracts are entered into primarily by our cts segment and to a lesser extent by our cds segment 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred 
earnings related to services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
certain of our transportation systems service contracts contain service level or system usage incentives  for which we recognize revenues when the incentive award is fixed or determinable 
these contract incentives are generally based upon monthly service levels or monthly performance and become fixed or determinable on a monthly basis 
however  one of our transportation systems service contracts contains annual system usage incentives which are based upon system usage compared to annual baseline amounts 
for this contract the annual system usage incentives are not considered fixed or determinable until the end of the contract year for which the incentives are measured  which falls within the second quarter of our fiscal year 
often these fees are based on meeting certain contractually required service levels or based on system usage levels 

table of contents approximately half of our total sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense and certain advertising activities are unallowable and  therefore  not recoverable through sales 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
corporate management and our internal auditors also monitor compliance with our revenue recognition policies and review contract status with segment personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and many of them are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period such changes are enacted 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company includes interest and penalties related to income taxes  including unrecognized tax benefits  within the income tax provision 
the company s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while the company believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns  the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
the company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future and therefore no amounts of undistributed earnings are available for distribution 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
purchased intangibles we generally fund acquisitions using cash on hand 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with an acquisition are recorded at their fair values determined by management as of the date of acquisition 
the excess of the transaction consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we amortize intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations over their estimated useful lives unless their useful lives are determined to be indefinite 
for certain business combinations  we utilize independent valuations to assist us in estimating the fair value of purchased intangibles 
our purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and programs acquired and customer relationships  which are amortized over periods of years or less 
the determination of the value and useful life of purchased intangibles is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of annual amortization expense we record is affected by these judgments 
for example  if the weighted average amortization period for our purchased intangibles was one year less than we have determined  our amortization expense would have increased by approximately million 
valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision 
table of contents to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
any resulting impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions mission support services defense systems transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for the first step of our fiscal impairment test  the discounted cash flows used in the fair value analyses were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
we used a five year forecast for our mission support services reporting unit and we used three year forecasts for our transportation systems and defense systems reporting units 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of five years for our mission support services reporting unit  and three years for our transportation systems and defense systems reporting units 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of for our defense systems reporting unit  for our mission support services reporting unit and for our transportation systems reporting unit 
slowed defense spending and margin compression due to competitive pressures on bid rates have impacted operating results and tempered the projected cash flows of our mss reporting unit  negatively impacting our estimate of its fair value 
step one of the impairment test concluded that the carrying value of our mss reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded its estimated fair value 
for our remaining two reporting units  the estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values 
the fair value of our cts and cds reporting units would remain in excess of their respective carrying values even if there were a decrease in their fair value at july  for our mss reporting unit  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting unit s fair value  which was determined in the first step of the impairment test  to its assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the results of the step two analysis  we recorded a million goodwill impairment in after recognition of the goodwill impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill  the fair value of our mss reporting unit would remain in excess of its carrying value even if there were a decrease in its fair value at july  unforeseen negative changes in future business or other market conditions for mss  including further margin compression or loss of business  could cause recorded goodwill to be impaired in the future 
also  changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of mss or our other reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

table of contents pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
mortality rates are based on published mortality tables 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans limits the impact any individual assumption changes would have on earnings 
for example  if the assumed rate of return on pension assets was basis points higher or lower than we have assumed  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million  assuming all other assumptions were held constant 
holding all other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would increase or decrease net earnings for by approximately million  and would have decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at september   by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt securities whose return is tied to short term interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  australia and new zealand which are also tied to short term rates the us prime rate  the australia bank bill swap bid rate and the new zealand base rate 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies which have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  the us  australia and new zealand 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  australia and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we may in the future use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
we intend to obtain financing in the future in order to finance a transportation contract with a customer for which we have incurred significant costs prior to receiving payments under the contract 
in order to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates prior to obtaining this financing  we have entered into a forward starting swap to reduce interest rate variability exposure for the projected interest rate cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we believe that our hedging activities limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
