table of contents dodd frank act federal regulators continue to implement many provisions of the dodd frank act  which was signed into law by president obama on july  the dodd frank act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions  including depository institutions 
many provisions of the dodd frank act still have not been implemented and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators  including banking regulators and the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  the consumer financial protection bureau has only recently begun to implement its authority  and there is significant uncertainty as to how its regulations and other authority will affect the company s business 
farmers continues to closely monitor all relevant sections of the dodd frank act to ensure continued compliance with these regulatory requirements 
the following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the dodd frank act that have and may continue to affect farmers and farmers bank the consumer financial protection bureau has been established and empowered to exercise broad regulatory  supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws  the dodd frank act restricts the preemption of state law by federal law and disallows subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption  the deposit insurance assessment base for federal deposit insurance has been expanded from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity  the dodd frank act instructs appropriate federal banking agencies to make the capital requirements for banks and savings and loan holding companies and insured depository institutions countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction  consistent with safety and soundness  the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits has been repealed  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer has been permanently increased to  and non interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited deposit insurance through january   bank holding companies  such as farmers  are required to be well capitalized and well managed and must continue to be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state  the dodd frank act extended the application to most bank holding companies of the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions  which  among other things  will disallow treatment of trust preferred securities as tier capital under certain circumstances  new corporate governance requirements  which are generally applicable to most larger public companies  now require new compensation practices  including  but not limited to  providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation  to consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements  the dodd frank act amended the electronic fund transfer act to  among other things  give the federal reserve board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer  and the authority of the federal reserve board to examine bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries was expanded 

table of contents many aspects of the dodd frank act are still subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on farmers  its customers or the financial services industry more generally 
bank holding company regulation as a bank holding company  farmers activities are subject to extensive regulation by the federal reserve board under the bhca 
generally  the bhca limits the business of bank holding companies to banking  managing or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve board has determined to be closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
under federal reserve board policy  a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks 
under this policy  the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the holding company s shareholders if the federal reserve board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice 
the dodd frank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement 
the bhca requires prior approval by the federal reserve board for a bank holding company to directly or indirectly acquire more than a voting interest in any bank or its parent holding company 
factors taken into consideration in making such a determination include the effect of the acquisition on competition  the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition  the projected capital ratios and levels on a post acquisition basis  and the acquiring institution s record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves 
the bhca also governs interstate banking and restricts farmers nonbanking activities to those determined by the federal reserve board to be financial in nature  or incidental or complementary to such financial activity  without regard to territorial restrictions 
transactions among the bank and its affiliates are also subject to certain limitations and restrictions of the federal reserve board  as described more fully under the caption dividends and transactions with affiliates in this item the gramm leach bliley act of permits a qualifying bank holding company to elect to become a financial holding company and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature and not otherwise permissible for a bank holding company 
farmers has not elected to seek financial holding company status 
regulation of nationally chartered banks as a national banking association  farmers bank is subject to regulation under the national banking act and is periodically examined by the occ 
occ regulations govern permissible activities  capital requirements  dividend limitations  investments  loans and other matters 
furthermore  farmers bank is subject  as a member bank  to certain rules and regulations of the federal reserve board  many of which restrict activities and prescribe documentation to protect consumers 
under the bank merger act  the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with  or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of  another bank 
in reviewing applications to approve merger and other acquisition transactions  the occ and other bank regulatory authorities may include among their considerations the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions  the capital position of the combined organization  the applicant s performance under the cra  and fair housing laws  and the effectiveness of the entities in restricting money laundering activities 
in addition  the establishment of branches by farmers bank is subject to the prior approval of the occ 
the occ has the authority to impose sanctions on the bank and  under certain circumstances  may place farmers bank into receivership 
the bank is also an insured institution as a member of the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  it is subject to regulation and deposit insurance assessments by the fdic 

table of contents dividends and transactions with affiliates the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries 
the company s principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common shares and service its debt is dividends from farmers bank and its other subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that farmers bank may pay to farmers without regulatory approval 
farmers bank generally may not  without prior regulatory approval  pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
in addition  prior approval of the occ is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of farmers bank s net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years 
in addition  farmers and farmers bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends  including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to determine under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof 
the federal banking agencies have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  in the current financial and economic environment  the federal reserve board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels  unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
thus  the ability of farmers to pay dividends in the future is currently influenced  and could be further influenced  by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines 
the bank is subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value to the company and its nonbanking subsidiaries and affiliates  whether in the form of loans and other extensions of credit  investments and asset purchases  or other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate 
these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm s length basis 
in general  these regulations require that any covered transaction by farmers bank with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited  as to any one of farmers or its non bank subsidiaries  to of farmers bank s capital stock and surplus  and  as to farmers and all such non bank subsidiaries in the aggregate  to of farmers bank s capital stock and surplus 
the dodd frank act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization including  for example  the requirement that the of capital limit on covered transactions apply to financial subsidiaries 
covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit  as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate  a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board from the affiliate  certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate  the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan  and the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
capital loans from the company to the bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the bank 
in the event of farmers bankruptcy  any commitment by farmers to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of farmers bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 
the federal deposit insurance act of  as amended  provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as the bank  the insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured  nondeposit creditors  including the company  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 

table of contents capital adequacy both farmers and farmers bank are subject to risk based capital requirements imposed by their respective primary federal banking regulator 
these capital guidelines are based on the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel i  published by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee in the guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework for evaluating capital levels and make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations  takes off balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid  low risk assets 
capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions 
under the guidelines  the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the minimum total risk based capital ratio must be composed of tier capital  which consists of i common shareholders equity  ii minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and iii a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities although the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities will be phased out under the dodd frank act in certain circumstances  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets  including unrealized net gains and losses  after applicable taxes  on available for sale securities carried at fair value 
the remainder of total risk based capital tier risk based capital may consist of certain amounts of hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible debt  subordinated debt  preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  loan and lease loss allowance and net unrealized gains on certain available for sale equity securities  all subject to limitations established by the guidelines 
under the guidelines  capital is compared to the relative risk on farmers and farmers bank s balance sheet 
to derive the risk included in the balance sheet  one of four risk weights   and is applied to different balance sheet and off balance sheet assets  primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
the federal reserve board has also established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
the federal reserve board guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets excluding the loan and lease loss allowance  goodwill and certain other intangibles  or leverage ratio  of for bank holding companies that meet certain criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating  and for all other bank holding companies 
the guidelines further provide that bank holding companies experiencing growth through acquisitions or otherwise  or under other warranted circumstances  will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the occ and the fdic have each also adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines for national banks and for state non member banks  respectively 
the federal reserve board s review of certain bank holding company transactions is affected by whether the applying bank holding company is well capitalized 
to be deemed well capitalized  the bank holding company must have a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a leverage ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least  and must not be subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 

table of contents in  the basel committee published a new  more risk sensitive capital adequacy framework basel ii for large  internationally active banking organizations 
in december  the federal banking agencies issued final rules making the implementation of certain parts of basel ii mandatory for any bank that has consolidated total assets of at least billion excluding certain assets or has consolidated on balance sheet foreign exposure of at least billion  and making it voluntary for other banks 
the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic to adopt regulations imposing minimum basel i based capital requirements in cases where the basel ii based capital requirements and any changes in capital regulations resulting from basel iii discussed below otherwise would permit lower requirements 
in june  the federal banking agencies adopted a rule applicable to only large  internationally active banks requiring their risk based capital to meet the higher of the minimum requirements under basel iii or under the risk based capital rules generally applicable to united states banks 
in december and january  the basel committee released a final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation basel iii 
basel iii  when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phased in  will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
the basel iii final capital framework  among other things  i introduces as a new capital measure of common equity tier cet  ii specifies that tier capital consist of cet and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements  iii defines cet narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet and not to the other components of capital  and iv expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations 
when fully phased in on january   basel iii will require banks to maintain i as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of  plus a capital conservation buffer which is added to the cet ratio as that buffer is phased in  which will effectively result in a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of  ii a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the tier capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of on full implementation  iii a minimum ratio of total tier plus tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of upon full implementation  and iv as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum leverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of tier capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off balance sheet exposures computed as the average for each quarter of the month end ratios for the quarter 
basel iii also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer  generally imposed when federal banking agencies determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk  that would be in addition to the capital conservation buffer in the range of to when fully implemented  potentially resulting in total buffers of to 
the countercyclical capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress 
banking institutions with a ratio of cet to risk weighted assets above the minimum  but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer  when applicable will have constraints imposed on their dividends  equity repurchases and compensation  based on the amount of the shortfall 
the implementation of the basel iii capital framework was scheduled to commence on january   but has since been delayed 
banking institutions will be required to maintain cet to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets 

table of contents the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet  including the deduction of mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non consolidated financial entities if any one such category exceeds of cet or if all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet will be phased in on a pro rata basis over a five year period beginning on january  implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january  at and be phased in over a four year period increasing each subsequent january by the same amount until it reaches on january  
the timing for the federal banking agencies publication of proposed rules to implement the basel iii capital framework and the implementation schedule is uncertain 
however  it is anticipated that rules implementing basel iii will be proposed for comment in mid notwithstanding its release of the basel iii framework as a final framework  the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii  including imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions 
in addition to basel iii  the dodd frank act requires or permits federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting capital requirements in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions 
accordingly  the regulations ultimately applicable to the company may differ substantially from the currently published final basel iii framework 
requirements of higher capital levels or higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the company s net income and return on equity 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies have established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve certain of the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
this system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies may or in some cases must take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank s capital level 
for example  the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within days after it becomes critically undercapitalized unless the bank s primary regulator determines  with the concurrence of the fdic  that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes 
banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank s capital category 
for example  a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market  and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee  in part  specific aspects of the bank s capital plan for the plan to be acceptable 
federal law permits the occ to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired  by losses or otherwise  to relieve a deficiency in such national bank s capital stock 
this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale  to the extent necessary  of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment 
as the sole shareholder of farmers bank  the company is subject to such provisions 
deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  and farmers bank is assessed deposit insurance premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
insurance premiums for each insured institution are determined based upon the institution s capital level and supervisory rating provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and other information 
table of contents deemed by the fdic to be relevant to the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund by the institution 
the assessment rate is then applied to the amount of the institution s deposits to determine the institution s insurance premium 
on february   the fdic approved a final rule that changed the deposit insurance assessment base  as required by the dodd frank act 
as adopted  the final rule changed the deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity 
in addition  the final rule also adopted a new large bank pricing assessment scheme and established a target size for the deposit insurance fund 
specifically  the final rule set a target size for the deposit insurance fund at percent of insured deposits and implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches percent and  in lieu of dividends  provides for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches percent and percent 
the final rule also created a scorecard based assessment system for banks with more than billion in assets 
the final rule went into effect beginning with the second quarter of as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by federally insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any federally insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement entered into with the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
fiscal and monetary policies the company s business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the company is particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states in order to influence general economic conditions  primarily through open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements against depository institutions deposits 
these policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits  as well as interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on operations and results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to have significant effects in the future 
in view of the changing conditions in the economy  the money markets and activities of monetary and fiscal authorities  farmers can make no predictions as to future changes in interest rates  credit availability or deposit levels 
community reinvestment act the cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice 
under the cra  each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by  among other things  providing credit to low and moderate income individuals and communities 
depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the cra and are assigned ratings 
in order for a bank holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhca  or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the bhca  each insured depository institution subsidiary of the bank holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra 
furthermore  banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction 
farmers received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra examination 

table of contents customer privacy farmers bank is subject to regulations limiting the ability of financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow customers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party 
these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted and conveyed to outside vendors 
anti money laundering and the usa patriot act the uniting and strengthening of america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the usa patriot act and its related regulations require insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies  procedures  and controls to detect  prevent  and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing  subject to conditions  between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  for counter terrorism purposes 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
in addition  federal banking agencies are required  when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications  to take into account the effectiveness of the anti money laundering policies  procedures and controls of the applicants 
corporate governance the sarbanes oxley act of effected broad reforms to areas of corporate governance and financial reporting for public companies under the jurisdiction of the commission 
the company s corporate governance policies include an audit committee charter  a compensation committee charter  corporate governance and nominating committee charter  and code of business conduct and ethics 
the board of directors reviews the company s corporate governance practices on a continuing basis 
these and other corporate governance policies have been provided previously to shareholders and are available  along with other information on farmers corporate governance practices  on the company s website at www

executive and incentive compensation in june  the federal reserve board  occ and fdic issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies the joint guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
this principles based guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 

table of contents pursuant to the joint guidance  the federal reserve board will review as part of a regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as farmers 
such reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements 
the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution s supervisory ratings  which can affect the institution s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions 
enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures are not being taken to correct the deficiencies 
on february   the federal banking agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive based compensation arrangements under applicable provisions of the dodd frank act the proposed rules 
the proposed rules generally apply to financial institutions with billion or more in assets that maintain incentive based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees 
the proposed rules i prohibit covered financial institutions from maintaining incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage covered persons to expose the institution to inappropriate risk by providing the covered person with excessive compensation  ii prohibit covered financial institutions from establishing or maintaining incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss  iii require covered financial institutions to maintain policies and procedures appropriate to their size  complexity and use of incentive based compensation to help ensure compliance with the proposed rules  and iv require covered financial institutions to provide enhanced disclosure to regulators regarding their incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons within days following the end of the fiscal year 
public companies will also be required  once stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the dodd frank act  to implement clawback procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements 
this clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three year look back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards 
the dodd frank act also provides shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation practices  imposes new executive compensation disclosure requirements  and contains additional considerations of the independence of compensation advisors beginning in future legislation various and significant legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry is from time to time introduced in the us congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change the operating environment for farmers and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways and could significantly increase or decrease the costs of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions 
with the enactment of the dodd frank act and the continuing implementation of final rules and regulations thereunder  the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remains very unpredictable 
farmers cannot predict the scope and timing of any such future legislation and  if enacted  the effect that it could have on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
summary to the extent that the foregoing information describes statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to the company or its subsidiaries  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of those provisions or 
table of contents agreements 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by the us congress and state legislatures as well as federal and state regulatory agencies and are subject to change at any time  particularly in the current economic and regulatory environment 
any such change in applicable statutes  regulations or regulatory policies could have a material effect on farmers and its business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors 
the following are certain risk factors that could materially and negatively affect our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
the risks that are discussed below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
additional risks that are not presently known or that we presently deem to be immaterial could also have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to economic and market conditions difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected our industry and our business 
beginning in the latter half of through  the us economy was in recession and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the u 
s 
was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have improved  certain sectors  such as real estate and manufacturing  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
it is also possible that recent improvements may be reversed if current economic turmoil in europe becomes global or the united states congress fails to resolve certain critical fiscal policies it is now facing  including the automatic budget cuts contemplated in the sequester arrangement and raising the federal government s debt ceiling in time to avoid a default 
in addition  many local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to depressed consumer spending and continued decreased liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions have also led to poor financial performance resulting in the failure and merger of a number of financial institutions 
these failures  as well as possible future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization levels and of the deposit insurance fund  which has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
our success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  money supply  governmental fiscal policies  and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  our earnings 
because we have a significant amount of real estate loans  additional decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing loans to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses  it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
moreover  the financial accounting standards board may change its requirements for establishing the loan loss allowance 
the substantial majority of our loans are to individuals and businesses in the mahoning valley and stark county the valley 
consequently  further significant declines in the economy in the valley could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
it is uncertain when the negative credit trends in our market will reverse  and  therefore  future earnings are susceptible to further declining credit conditions in the market in which we operate 

table of contents changes in interest rates could adversely affect income and financial condition 
our earnings and cash flow are dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and  to a lesser extent  securities and the interest expense generated by our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings 
our level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest earning assets  the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities 
these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities which  in turn  are impacted by external factors  such as the local economy  competition for loans and deposits  the monetary policy of the federal reserve board and market interest rates 
interest rates are beyond our control  and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits 
while we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment  there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk 
see additional interest rate risk discussion under the market risk section found in item a of this annual report on form k 
defaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally 
the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit  trading  clearing or other relationships between institutions 
as a result  concerns about  or a default or threatened default by  one institution could lead to significant market wide liquidity and credit problems  losses or defaults by other institutions 
this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries  such as clearing agencies  clearing houses  banks  securities firms and exchanges  with which we and our subsidiaries interact on a daily basis  and therefore could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business we extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment 
we manage credit risk through a program of underwriting standards  the review of certain credit decisions and an on going process of assessment of the quality of credit already extended 
our credit standards and on going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses 
we take credit risk by virtue of making loans  extending loan commitments and letters of credit and  to a lesser degree  purchasing non governmental securities 
our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize in market lending  while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations 
our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified 
while these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary  and to take proactive corrective actions  there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk 
we have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial real estate and residential real estate 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and residential real estate loans  including real estate development  construction and residential and commercial mortgage loans 
consequently  real estate related credit risks are a significant concern for us 
the adverse consequences from real estate related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by national economic 
table of contents developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers 
general difficulties in our real estate markets have recently contributed to increases in our non performing loans  charge offs  and decreases in our income 
our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in ohio 
accordingly  the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  and the value of the collateral securing such loans  may be significantly affected by economic conditions in the regions we serve or by changes in the local real estate markets 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment  acts of terrorism  or other factors beyond our control could therefore have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our indirect lending exposes us to increased credit risks 
a portion of our current lending involves the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers located in northeastern ohio 
these loans are for the purchase of new or late model used cars 
we serve customers over a broad range of creditworthiness  and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles 
while these loans have higher yields than many of our other loans  such loans involve significant risks in addition to normal credit risk 
potential risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through dealers  the absence of assured continued employment of the borrower  the varying general creditworthiness of the borrower  changes in the local economy  and difficulty in monitoring collateral 
while indirect automobile loans are secured  such loans are secured by depreciating assets and characterized by loan to value ratios that could result in us not recovering the full value of an outstanding loan upon default by the borrower 
due to the economic slowdown in our primary market area  we currently are experiencing higher delinquencies  charge offs and repossessions of vehicles in this portfolio 
if the economy continues to contract  we may continue to experience higher levels of delinquencies  repossessions and charge offs 
commercial and industrial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans 
any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would hurt our earnings and cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
the increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors  including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the size of loan balances  the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans 
in addition  when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan  we may take a security interest in commercial real estate  and  in some instances upon a default by the borrower  we may foreclose on and take title to the property  which may lead to potential financial risks 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our allowance for loan loss may not be adequate to cover actual future losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover current  probable incurred loan losses 
every loan we make carries a certain risk of non repayment  and we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans 
through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio  management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio  the collateral supporting the loans and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations with us 
the amount of future losses is 
table of contents susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which may be beyond our control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
we cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  which will require additions to the allowance 
excessive loan losses and significant additions to our allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay our wholesale borrowings and other liabilities and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers 
our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base  which is raised through our retail branch system 
core deposits savings and money market accounts  time deposits less than thousand and demand deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  additional available unused wholesale sources of liquidity include advances from the fhlb  issuances through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled million at december  an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or negative regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole  as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets 
our business strategy includes continuing our growth plans 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
we intend to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy both within our existing markets and in new markets 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development 
we cannot assure that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if we grow more slowly than anticipated  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense  and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need 
in order to attract and retain qualified employees  we must compensate them at market levels 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position  our performance  including our competitive position  could suffer  and  in turn  adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
strong competition within the market in which we operate could reduce our ability to attract and retain business 
in our market  we encounter significant competition from banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial service companies 
as a result of their size and ability to achieve 
table of contents economies of scale  some of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services than we can offer 
in particular  the competition includes major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
our ability to maintain our history of strong financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on our continued ability to compete successfully in our market 
financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will also depend on our ability to expand our scope of available financial services to our customers 
in addition to other banks  competitors include securities dealers  brokers  investment advisors  and finance and insurance companies 
the increasingly competitive environment is  in part  a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to utilize alternative methods to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are exposed to operational risk 
similar to any large organization  we are exposed to many types of operational risk  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
given the volume of transactions we process  certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified 
our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss of liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information  whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could severely harm our business 
as part of our financial institution business  we collect  process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of our subsidiaries and other third parties 
despite the security measures we have in place  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors 
table of contents or other similar events 
if information security is breached  information could be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information  whether by us or by our vendors  could severely damage our reputation  expose us to the risks of litigation and liability or disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends  distributions and other payments 
as a bank holding company  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries 
our principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares is dividends from these subsidiaries 
federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our banking and other subsidiaries may pay to us without regulatory approval 
in the event our subsidiaries become unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to pay dividends on our outstanding common shares 
accordingly  our inability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further discussion of our ability to pay dividends can be found under the caption dividends and transactions with affiliates in item of this annual report on form k 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
federal banking agencies have proposed extensive changes to their capital requirements  including raising required amounts and eliminating the inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital 
the final form of such regulations and their impact on the company is unknown at this time but may require us to raise additional capital 
in addition  we may elect to raise capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or for other anticipated reasons 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on financial performance  conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  including the satisfaction or release of preemptive rights in the event of a common share offering  many of which are outside our control 
therefore  there can be no assurance additional capital can be raised when needed or that capital can be raised on acceptable terms 
the inability to raise capital may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
impairment of investment securities  goodwill  other intangible assets  or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings  which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations 
in assessing the impairment of investment securities  we consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
under current accounting standards  goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but  instead  are assessed for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present 
assessment of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes 
under such circumstances  the intangible asset s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period 
deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized 
should management determine it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  a valuation allowance with a change to earnings would be reflected in the period 

table of contents risks related to the legal and regulatory environment increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the fdic maintains the deposit insurance fund to resolve the cost of bank failures 
since  the number of bank failures has increased significantly  which dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the deposit insurance fund 
also during this period  the fdic and the us congress have instituted two programs to further insure customer deposits at fdic member banks i deposit accounts are now insured up to  per customer up from  and ii non interest bearing transactional accounts are fully insured unlimited coverage through january  these actions have placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund 
since late  the fdic has taken various actions intended to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund 
these actions have included increasing assessment rates for all insured institutions  requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels  imposing special assessments and requiring insured depository institutions to prepay their quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and full years through in addition  on february   the fdic approved a final rule that changed the deposit insurance assessment base and assessment rate schedule  adopted a new large bank pricing assessment scheme  and set a target size for the deposit insurance fund 
the rule  as mandated by the dodd frank act  finalized a target size for the deposit insurance fund at percent of insured deposits 
the final rule went into effect beginning with the second quarter of we have a limited ability to control the amount of premiums we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional financial institution failures or other significant legislative or regulatory changes  the fdic may be required to increase assessment rates or take actions similar to those taken during increases in fdic insurance assessment rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all 
the expiration of unlimited fdic insurance coverage of non interest bearing transaction accounts effective december   may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds 
the dodd frank act provided for unlimited fdic insurance coverage of non interest bearing transaction accounts through december  the end of such insurance 
may cause us 
to lose certain large deposits or 
may result 
in our needing to pledge additional securities to secure public funds deposits  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
in order to ensure adequate liquidity  we may need to raise rates we pay on deposits  resulting in a decrease in profitability 
legislative or regulatory changes or actions  or significant litigation  could adversely impact us or the businesses in which we are engaged 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations 
laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers  depositors and the deposit insurance fund  and not to benefit our shareholders 
the impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by an institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
additionally  actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could cause us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us and our shareholders 

table of contents in addition to laws  regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks  proposals to reform the housing finance market consider winding down fannie mae and freddie mac  which could negatively affect our sales of loans 
the recently enacted dodd frank act may adversely impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the us there are a number of reform provisions that are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies do business 
a detailed discussion regarding the dodd frank act can be found under the caption dodd frank act in item of this annual report on form k 
many provisions of the dodd frank act will not be implemented immediately and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators 
we are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the dodd frank act to ensure continued compliance with all new or revised laws and regulations 
while the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act cannot currently be determined  the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees paid to regulators  along with possible restrictions on our banking operations  all of which may have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act beginning on july  as a result  some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
we do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer as market interest rates increase 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract new customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising in foreclosure practices  including delays in the foreclosure process  related to certain industry deficiencies  as well as potential losses in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages sold into the secondary market 
recent announcements of deficiencies in foreclosure documentation by several large seller servicer financial institutions have raised various concerns relating to mortgage foreclosure practices 
the integrity of the foreclosure process is important to our business  as an originator and servicer of residential mortgages 
as a result of our continued focus of concentrating our lending efforts in our primary markets in ohio  as well as servicing loans for the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  we do not anticipate suspending any of our foreclosure activities 
during  we reviewed our foreclosure procedures and concluded they are generally conservative in nature and do not present the significant documentation deficiencies underlying other industry foreclosure problems 
nevertheless  we could face delays and challenges in the foreclosure process arising from claims relating to industry practices generally  which could adversely affect recoveries and our financial results  whether through increased expenses of litigation and property maintenance  deteriorating values of underlying mortgaged properties or unsuccessful litigation results generally 
in addition  in connection with the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market  we make certain representations and warranties  which  if breached  may require us to repurchase such loans  
table of contents substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans 
although we believe that our mortgage documentation and procedures have been appropriate and are generally conservative in nature  it is possible that we will receive repurchase requests in the future and we may not be able to reach favorable settlements with respect to such requests 
it is therefore possible that we may increase our reserves or may sustain losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
in addition  we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures requiring the performance of an environmental site assessment before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these assessments may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local taxes  including income  excise  sales use  payroll  franchise  withholding and ad valorem taxes 
changes to our taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local taxes 
changes in taxes paid by our customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products  which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products 
in addition  such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage backed securities in which we have invested 
changes to the healthcare laws in the united states may increase the number of employees who choose to participate in our healthcare plans  which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer healthcare coverage to our eligible employees with part of the cost subsidized by the company 
with recent changes to the healthcare laws in the united states becoming effective in  more of our employees may choose to participate in our health insurance plans  which could increase our costs for such coverage and material adversely impact our costs of operations 
anti takeover provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control by a third party 
provisions of the ohio general corporation law  our articles of incorporation  and our amended code of regulations  including a staggered board and supermajority vote requirements for significant corporate changes  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 

table of contents we may be a defendant from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation and other actions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation arising out of our business 
our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us  and any claims asserted against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may harm our reputation 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms  if at all

results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and the company s net income totaled million during  compared to million for on a per share basis  diluted earnings per share were as compared to diluted earnings per share for common comparative ratios for results of operations include the return on average assets and return on average stockholders equity 
for  the return on average equity was  compared to for the return on average assets was for and the results for included million in gains on sales of securities  compared to million in net interest income net interest income  the principal source of the company s earnings  represents the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
for  taxable equivalent net interest income increased thousand  or  from interest earning assets averaged billion during  increasing million  or  compared to the company s interest bearing liabilities increased from million in to million in the company finances its earning assets with a combination of interest bearing and interest free funds 
the interest bearing funds are composed of deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
interest paid for the use of these funds is the second factor in the net interest income equation 
interest free funds  such as demand deposits and stockholders equity  require no interest expense and  therefore  contribute significantly to net interest income 

table of contents the profit margin  or spread  on invested funds is a key performance measure 
the company monitors two key performance indicators net interest spread and net interest margin 
the net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread in was  decreasing from in the net interest margin represents the overall profit margin net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
this performance indicator gives effect to interest earned for all investable funds including the substantial volume of interest free funds 
for  the net interest margin  measured on a fully taxable equivalent basis  decreased to  compared to in the decrease in net interest margin is largely a result of the change in the mix of interest earning assets 
loans  which yield more than securities  comprised a smaller level of interest earning assets in the current year 
for  loans were of average earning assets  compared to for total taxable equivalent interest income was million for  which is million less than the million reported in average loans increased million  or  in  and the yields decreased from in to in income from securities  federal funds and other decreased thousand  or  in  farmers saw its yields on these assets decrease from in to in the average balance of investment securities and federal funds sold increased in  mainly due to increases in customer deposits outpacing opportunities to grow loans 
total interest expense amounted to million for  a decrease from million reported in the decrease in is the result of lower rates of interest paid on interest bearing deposits and repurchase agreements 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in management will continue to evaluate future changes in interest rates and the shape of the treasury yield curve so that assets and liabilities may be priced accordingly to minimize the impact on the net interest margin 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased by thousand in the increase in noninterest income is primarily due to income from the sale of loans  increasing from thousand for the twelve months ended december  to thousand for the same twelve month period in the company decided to sell some of the residential real estate loans it originates in order to decrease interest rate risk  reduce liquidity risk and to diversify its revenue streams 
the increase in loans sold income was offset by a decrease in security gains  which were thousand higher in trust fees also increased thousand and investment commissions increased thousand  as management continues to focus on diversifying revenue sources to decrease the reliance on net interest income as the main driver of revenue 
noninterest expenses noninterest expense for was million  compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
most of the increase was a result of a increase in salary and employee benefits  resulting from a higher number of employees in the current year and a thousand or increase in health insurance costs 
the higher employee count is attributed primarily to our secondary mortgage project expansion 
occupancy and equipment expense also increased thousand as a result of depreciation expense and small equipment costs related to new facilities 
professional fees increased as a result of corporate legal and consulting fees related to compensation practices and other business advisory fees 
there was also an thousand or decrease in other operating expenses in compared to  mainly related to new facilities opened in these expense increases were offset by million in prepayment penalties paid to federal home loan bank of cincinnati in the prior year  compared to none in state and local taxes also increased thousand or as a result of an increase in intangible tax paid to the state of ohio due to higher levels of stockholders equity 
core processing charges also increased thousand due to a higher number accounts and new banking products for our customers 

table of contents the company s tax equivalent efficiency ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was  compared to for the same period in the main factor leading to the decline in the efficiency ratio was the increase in noninterest expenses as explained earlier in this section 
the efficiency ratio is calculated as follows non interest expense divided by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus non interest income  excluding security gains and losses and intangible amortization 
this ratio is a measure of the expense incurred to generate a dollar of revenue 
management will continue to closely monitor and keep the increases in other expenses to a minimum 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million for and million in income taxes are computed using the appropriate effective tax rates for each period 
the increase in the current year tax expense can be mainly attributed to the million increase in income before taxes 
the effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to nontaxable interest and dividend income 
the effective income tax rate was for and for the effective tax rate increase over the same period in was primarily due to the reduction in the amount of tax exempt municipal securities income as a percentage of total income for the year 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the effective tax rate

total interest expense amounted to million for  a decrease from million reported in the decrease in is the result of lower rates of interest paid on interest bearing deposits and repurchase agreements 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in noninterest income total noninterest income in decreased by thousand 
some of this decrease is a result of an thousand decrease in gains on sales of securities 
during  farmers sold million in securities to recognize market appreciation on existing holdings  pay off million in fhlb advances in order to reduce 
table of contents its cost of funds  and reinvested the remaining million to further diversify the securities portfolio 
bank owned life insurance income also decreased thousand in this decrease is primarily due to the receipt of death benefit proceeds in excess of cash value in  which are included in income 
these decreases in noninterest income were offset by increases in trust fee income of thousand and investment commissions of thousand  as management continues to focus on diversifying revenue sources to decrease the reliance on net interest income as the main driver of revenue 
noninterest expenses noninterest expense for was million  compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million  or 
some of this increase is a result of a million prepayment penalty related to the payoff of advances from the fhlb 
the advances were paid off prior to maturity to decrease farmers cost of funds and improve regulatory risk based capital ratios 
this strategy also allows the company to remove longer duration assets in order to improve the market value of the company s capital in a rising rate environment 
there was also a thousand or increase in other operating expenses in compared to  mainly due to higher consulting and other real estate owned expenses 
this increase was partially offset by the fdic insurance expense decrease in of thousand or over  due to the change in the assessment base by the fdic 
assessments are now based on asset size  as opposed to being based on deposit size as in prior years 
salaries and employee benefits also increased million  primarily resulting from a higher number of employees 
the higher employee count is attributed primarily to the newly created north canton office as well as staff added to originate and sell residential real estate loans in the secondary market 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million for and the effective income tax rate was for and for liquidity farmers maintains  in the opinion of management  liquidity sufficient to satisfy depositors requirements and meet the credit needs of customers 
the company depends on its ability to maintain its market share of deposits as well as acquiring new funds 
the company s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends in large measure on its profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
principal sources of liquidity include assets considered relatively liquid  such as short term investment securities  federal funds sold and cash and due from banks 
along with its liquid assets  farmers has additional sources of liquidity available which help to insure that adequate funds are available as needed 
these other sources include  but are not limited to  loan repayments  the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds and borrowings on approved lines of credit at two major domestic banks 
at december   farmers had not borrowed against these lines of credit 
management feels that its liquidity position is more than adequate and will continue to monitor the position on a monthly basis 
the company also has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb  as well as access to the federal reserve discount window  which provides an additional source of funds 
the company views its membership in the fhlb as a solid source of liquidity 
as of december   the bank is eligible to borrow an additional million from the fhlb under various fixed rate and variable rate credit facilities 
advances outstanding from the fhlb at december  amounted to million 
farmers primary investing activities are originating loans and purchasing securities 
during  net cash used in investing activities amounted to million  compared to million in net increases in loans were million in  compared to a million net decrease in purchases of securities available for sale were million in  compared to million in proceeds from maturities and sales of securities available for sale were million in  compared to million in 
table of contents farmers primary financing activities are obtaining deposits  repurchase agreements and other borrowings 
net cash from financing activities amounted to million for  compared to million in some of this change is a result of proceeds from a common stock offering amounting to million in compared to none in another factor contributing to the change was the repayment of federal home loan bank borrowings in amounting to million in compared to thousand in deposits increased million in  compared to a million in also  short term borrowings decreased million in  compared to a million decrease in loan portfolio maturities and sensitivities of loans to interest rates the following schedule shows the composition of loans and the percentage of loans in each category at the dates indicated

the increase in loans has mainly occurred in the commercial loan portfolio 
loans comprised of the bank s average earning assets in  compared to in the product mix in the loan portfolio includes commercial loans comprising  residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans and consumer loans at december  compared with   and  respectively  at december  loans contributed of total taxable equivalent interest income in and in loan yield was in  basis points greater than the average rate for total earning assets 
management recognizes that while the loan portfolio holds some of the bank s highest yielding assets  it is inherently the most risky portfolio 
accordingly  management attempts to balance credit risk versus return with conservative credit standards 
management has developed and maintains comprehensive underwriting guidelines and a loan review function that monitors credits during and after the approval process 
to minimize risks associated with changes in the borrower s future repayment capacity  the bank generally requires scheduled periodic principal and interest payments on all types of loans and normally requires collateral 

table of contents consumer loans increased from million on december  to million on december   representing a increase 
management continues to target the automobile dealer network to purchase indirect installment loans 
dealer paper was purchased using strict underwriting guidelines with an emphasis on quality 
indirect loans comprise of the consumer loan portfolio 
net charge offs in the consumer loan portfolio increased to thousand in  as compared to thousand in residential real estate mortgage loans decreased to million at december   compared to million in most of the decrease is a result of the decision to sell residential real estate mortgage loans originated in on the secondary market 
commercial real estate loans increased from million in to million in farmers originated both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages during fixed rate terms are generally limited to fifteen year terms while adjustable rate products are offered with maturities up to thirty years 
commercial loans at december  increased from year end with outstanding balances of million 
the growth in the commercial loan portfolio was consistent with the improvements in the local economy 
several new projects announced in the mahoning valley  along with decreased levels of unemployment has led small business owners to expand or make additional investments in their operations 
the bank s commercial loans are granted to customers within the immediate trade area of the bank 
the mix is diverse  covering a wide range of borrowers  business types and local municipalities 
the bank monitors and controls concentrations within a particular industry or segment of the economy 
these loans are made for purposes such as equipment purchases  capital and leasehold improvements  the purchase of inventory  general working capital and small business lines of credit 
summary of loan loss experience the following is an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated years ended december  balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate commercial  financial and agricultural residential real estate consumer total charge offs recoveries on previous charge offs commercial real estate commercial  financial and agricultural residential real estate consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
table of contents provisions charged to operations amounted to thousand in  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily due to fewer charge offs  a lower level of total delinquencies  a lower level of nonaccrual and nonperforming loans and a significant decline in substandard rated credits from the year ago period  which are factors considered in management s estimate of loan loss provisions and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming loans to total loans decreased from at december  to at december  the change in this ratio was the result of a decrease in nonperforming loans of million from december  although net charge offs for the year ended december  were million higher than the provision for loan losses  a higher provision was not necessary because of higher loss history quarters rolling off the company s quarter past experience  which is used to estimate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the lower provision was also impacted as a result of some of the charge offs during the year being specifically reserved for in the prior year 
in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses  management computes the historical loss percentage based upon the loss history of the past quarters 
in periods prior to the first quarter of  management used a historical loss percentage based on the past quarters 
the company believes that using a loss history of the previous quarters helps mitigate volatility in the timing of charge offs and better reflects probable incurred losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is based on management s judgment after taking into consideration all factors connected with the collectibility of the existing loan portfolio 
management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of economic conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  industry standards and other relevant factors 
specific factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operating expenses include previous charge off experience  the status of past due interest and principal payments  the quality of financial information supplied by loan customers and the general condition of the industries in the community to which loans have been made 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million during the year 
aside from the improvement in the various credit quality metrics discussed above  another reason for the decrease in the current year allowance for loan losses was a decrease in specific allocation on impaired loans 
at december   loans individually identified as impaired totaled million with an allowance allocation of thousand 
at the end of  loans considered to be impaired were million with an allowance allocation of thousand 
loans individually identified as impaired include nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans and loans with their contractual terms modified such that they represent troubled debt restructurings 
impaired loans are carried at the fair value of the underlying collateral  less estimated disposition costs  if repayment of the loan is expected to be solely dependent on the sale of the collateral 
otherwise  impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected cash flows 
the valuation of collateral dependent impaired loans is a challenging component of the financial reporting process due to the timing of when a loan is identified as impaired and the need to timely close farmers books for a given period 
typically  commercial and commercial real estate loans are identified as impaired when they become ninety days past due  or earlier if management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all amounts due under the terms of the loan agreement 
when farmers identifies a loan as impaired and also concludes that the loan is collateral dependent  farmers performs an internal collateral valuation as an interim measure 
farmers typically obtains an external appraisal to validate its internal collateral valuation as soon as is practical 
to the extent that an external appraisal returns a value estimate that is materially different from the internally generated estimate before the release of interim or annual financial statements  farmers adjusts the associated specific loss reserve and  if necessary  farmers consolidated financial statements for the difference 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans at december  was  compared to at december  the decrease in non performing loans is primarily related to the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is million or of loans at december  this ratio has decreased from the reported at december  
table of contents nonperforming assets december  nonaccrual loans commercial real estate commercial  financial and agricultural residential real estate consumer total nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans modified in troubled debt restructuring percentage of nonperforming loans to loans percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets loans delinquent days percentage of loans delinquent days to total loans not included in nonaccrual loans the company has forgone interest income of approximately thousand from nonaccrual loans as of december  that would have been earned during the year if all loans had performed in accordance with their original terms 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased from for to for the primary reason for the improvement is related to the residential real estate loan portfolio  experiencing a decrease in net charge offs from million in to thousand in the company s net charge offs were primarily concentrated in commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and residential real estate loans 
the net losses in commercial real estate loans accounted for of the total net losses  commercial and industrial loans accounted for of the total net losses  and residential real estate loans represented of the total 
a significant allocation in the allowance for loan losses is for performing commercial and commercial real estate loans classified by the internal loan review as substandard 
the loss experience on the average balance of this category of loans for the past three years has been approximately of the principal balance of these loans  which is management s allocation for these loans 
this equates to an allocation of approximately thousand at the end of compared to an allocation of million at the end of the allocation decreased due to decrease in the historical loss experience for the substandard loans as well as a decrease in the total balance of substandard loans 
the actual loss experience may be more or less than the amount allocated 
at december   the amount of substandard loans that continue to accrue interest is million 
as always  management is working to address weaknesses in each of these specific loans that may result in loss 

table of contents december  amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans commercial real estate commercial residential real estate consumer unallocated the allowance allocated to each of the four loan categories should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs in will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future charge off trends 
the allowance allocated to the one to four family real estate loan category and the consumer loan category is based upon the company s allowance methodology for homogeneous loans  and increases and decreases in the balances of those portfolios 
in previous years  the indirect installment loan category has represented the largest percentage of loan losses 
the one to four family real estate loan category represents approximately of total loans and in  the net loan losses accounted for of the losses of the entire loan portfolio 
for the commercial loan category  which represents only of the total loan portfolio  management relies on the bank s internal loan review procedures and allocates accordingly based on loan classifications 
the commercial real estate loan category represents of the total loan portfolio 
loan commitments and lines of credit in the normal course of business  the bank has extended various commitments for credit 
commitments for mortgages  revolving lines of credit and letters of credit generally are extended for a period of one month up to one year 
normally no fees are charged on any unused portion 
normally  an annual fee of two percent is charged for the issuance of a letter of credit 
as of december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans that are not disclosed as a category of loans 
as of that date also  there were no other interest earning assets that are either nonaccrual  past due  restructured or non performing 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio increased million in excess balances of federal funds sold were strategically invested throughout the year 
the company s investment strategy is to maintain a diverse investment security portfolio with a higher concentration in mortgage backed securities that are issued by us government sponsored enterprises and tax free municipal securities 
it is important to note that in the company increased its investment in small business administration securities  which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the us government  in order to further diversify its holdings 
farmers also sold million in securities in  resulting in net security gains of million 
farmers recognized market appreciation on faster paying mortgage backed securities and lower rated municipal securities  and reinvested in new mortgage backed securities and higher rated municipal securities to further diversify the securities portfolio 
farmers objective in managing the investment portfolio is to preserve and enhance corporate liquidity through investment in primarily short and intermediate term securities which are readily marketable and of the highest credit quality 
in general  investment in securities is limited to those funds the bank feels it has in excess of funds used to satisfy loan demand and operating considerations 
mortgage backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and issuance of a security 
mortgage backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages 
prepayment estimates for mortgage backed securities are performed at purchase to ensure that prepayment assumptions are reasonable considering the underlying collateral for the mortgage backed securities at issue and 
table of contents current mortgage interest rates and to determine the yield and estimated maturity of the mortgage backed security portfolio 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and may result in faster amortization of any premiums paid and thereby reduce the net yield on such securities

critical accounting policies the company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
some of these accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has identified three accounting policies that are critical accounting policies and an understanding of these policies is necessary to understand the financial statements 
these policies relate to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  if there are any securities that are other than temporarily impaired and if there is any impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
additional information regarding these policies is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  including note summary of significant accounting policies  note securities and note loans  and the sections above captioned loan portfolio and investment securities 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
farmers maintains an allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is presented as a reserve against loans on the balance sheets 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for credit losses provides for probable losses on loans 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on 
table of contents pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio represents the largest asset category on the consolidated balance sheets 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses considers individually impaired loans  pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics and other environmental risk factors 
pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics are assessed for probable losses 
probable losses are estimated through application of historical loss experience 
historical loss experience data used to establish loss estimates may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
as a result  the historical loss experience used in the allowance analysis may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
management also evaluates the impact of environmental factors which pose additional risks that may not adequately be addressed in the analyses described above 
such environmental factors could include levels of  and trends in  delinquencies and impaired loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry and geographic conditions  concentrations of credit such as  but not limited to  local industries  their employees  suppliers  or any other common risk factor that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio 
the determination of this component of the allowances requires considerable management judgment 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the loan portfolio section of this financial review includes a discussion of the factors driving changes in the allowance for loan losses during the current period 
other than temporary impairment of securities is the second critical accounting policy 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are other than temporary are reflected as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time  extent  and reasons that fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether farmers has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
management believes that the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies 
gaap establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impairment assessment of goodwill 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired 
the company s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of the company s trust to provide quality  cost effective trust services in a competitive marketplace 
the goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
gaap requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the fair value of the goodwill  which resides on the books of farmers trust  is estimated by reviewing the past and projected operating results for the subsidiary and trust banking industry comparable information 
at december   on a consolidated basis  farmers had intangibles of million subject to amortization and million of goodwill  which was not subject to periodic amortization 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by farmers during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be 
table of contents adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk important considerations in asset liability management are liquidity  the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the adequacy of capital 
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are those which have yields on rates subject to change within a future time period due to maturity of the instrument or changes in market rates 
while liquidity management involves meeting the funds flow requirements of the company  the management of interest rate sensitivity focuses on the structure of these assets and liabilities with respect to maturity and repricing characteristics 
balancing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities provides a means of tempering fluctuating interest rates and maintaining net interest margins through periods of changing interest rates 
the company monitors interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to determine the overall interest rate position over various time frames 
the company considers the primary market exposure to be interest rate risk 
simulation analysis is used to monitor the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  and the effect of the change to net interest income 
the following table shows the effect on net interest income and the net present value of equity in the event of a sudden and sustained basis point increase and basis point decrease in market interest rates changes in interest rate alco basis points result result guidelines net interest income change net present value of equity change it should be noted that the change in the net present value of equity exceeded policy when the simulation model assumed a sudden decrease in rates of basis points 
this primarily because the positive impact on the fair value of assets would not be as great as the negative impact on the fair value of certain liabilities 
specifically  because core deposits typically bear relatively low interest rates  their fair value would be negatively impacted as the rates could not be adjusted by the full extent of the sudden decrease in rates 
management does not believe that a basis rate decline is realistic in the current interest rate environment 
the remaining results of this analysis comply with internal limits established by the company 
a report on interest rate risk is presented to the board of directors and the asset liability committee on a quarterly basis 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
with the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities maturing within twelve months  the company monitors this area most closely 
early withdrawal of deposits  prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that can impact actual results in comparison to our simulation analysis 
in addition  changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal  which could result in a change in net interest margin 
interest rate sensitivity management provides some degree of protection against net interest income volatility 
it is not possible or necessarily desirable to attempt to eliminate this risk completely by matching interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
other factors  such as market demand  interest rate outlook  regulatory restraint and strategic planning also have an effect on the desired balance sheet structure
