fiscal and current market conditions during fiscal  bidding activity continued to improve 
we believe bidding activity is a leading indicator for the direction and health of our markets 
we believe the business environment is continuing to improve and that our customers are becoming more inclined to procure the equipment needed for their projects 
this supports our belief that our oil refining  petrochemical and related markets are still in the early stages of a business recovery 
we believe the current activity level within our pipeline continues to be more positive than in the past few years 
we believe the following demand trends that are affecting our customers investments include emerging economies  especially in asia  continue to have relatively strong economic growth 
this expansion is driving growing energy requirements and the need for more energy and energy related products 
the expansion of the economies of oil producing middle eastern countries  their desire to extract greater value from their oil and gas resources  and the continued global growth in demand for oil and refined products has renewed investment activity in that region 
we do not believe that the ongoing political unrest in the middle east has impacted our business to date 
moreover  the planned timeline of refinery and petrochemical projects in the major middle eastern countries is encouraging 
asian countries  specifically china and india  are experiencing renewed demand for energy products such as transportation fuel and consumer products derived from petrochemicals 
this renewed demand is driving increased investment in petrochemical and refining capacity 
although economic growth in asia appears to be moderating to a lower level  we believe that it remains a fast growing area and chinese and indian investments in refining  petrochemical and energy facilities appear to continue to be strong 

table of contents south america  specifically brazil  venezuela and colombia  is seeing increased refining and petrochemical investments that are driven by their expanding economies  and increased local demand for transportation fuels and other products that are made from oil as the feedstock 
there is also the desire to extract more value from their natural resources by supplying energy products into the global markets 
however  the south american market can be unpredictable and has historically been slower to invest than other emerging markets 
the us refining market has recently exhibited improvement 
we do not expect the us refining markets to return to the levels experienced during the last upcycle  but that such markets will improve compared with its levels over the past few years 
we expect that the us refining markets will continue to be an important aspect of our business 
we are beginning to see renewed signs of planned investments in the us to convert greater percentages of crude oil to transportation fuels  such as revamping distillation columns to extract residual higher value components from the low value waste stream 
we are also seeing renewed investment to expand the flexibility of facilities to allow them to utilize multiple feed stocks 
moreover  a trend to upgrade existing equipment in order to extend on stream operation duration between planned shutdowns has emerged that has resulted in an increase in demand for our equipment 
investments  including foreign investments  in north american oil sands projects have occurred over the past few years 
these investments suggest that downstream spending involving our equipment might increase in the next few years 
the dramatic change in natural gas costs and expectation of steady supply in the us has led to a revival in the us petrochemical market and a recent interest toward potential major investment 
there are numerous new projects in planning or initial engineering phases for the construction of new petrochemical producing facilities  including ethylene  ammonia and urea facilities 
in addition  existing petrochemical facilities are evaluating restarting idled process units or debottlenecking existing operations to increase throughput 
we currently have a number of these projects in our pipeline 
we historically have had strong market share within us petrochemical facilities 
proposed ethylene capacity expansion and re opening of mothballed facilities in the us  as well as downstream products  are being discussed by petrochemical producers for the first time in well over a decade 
lower natural gas cost is a relatively recent phenomena  having occurred over the past three years and is driven by technology advancements in drilling  creating a significant increase in supply 
this has made the us production of the raw material for ethylene  ethane which is a side product of natural gas production  globally competitive with naphtha the alternative feedstock for ethylene used in most of the world 
we believe investment in us petrochemical markets could be significant over the next one to five years 
investment in new nuclear power capacity in the us and internationally may become subject to increased uncertainty due to political and social pressures  which were augmented by the tragic earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan in march the continued progress at the new us nuclear reactor projects planned for the summer south carolina and vogtle georgia facilities suggest some growth in the domestic nuclear market 
investments in existing us nuclear plants to extend their operating life and add incremental capacity are expected to continue 
the need for additional safety and back up redundancies at existing domestic nuclear plants could increase demand for our products in the near term 
the desire to extend the life of the existing nuclear plants including new operating licenses and expanded output re rating of the facilities will require investment and could increase demand for our products 
we expect that the consequences of these trends  and specifically projected expansion in petrochemical and oil refining which should occur outside of north america  primarily in the growing asian and south american markets  will result in more pressure on our pricing and gross margins  as these markets historically provided lower margins than north american refining markets 
a counter to margin pressure from international markets may come from investments in new petrochemical capacity built in north america and the timing of such investments 

table of contents because of continued global economic and financial uncertainty and the risk associated with growth in emerging economies  we also expect that we will have continued volatility in our order pattern 
we continue to expect our new order levels to remain volatile  resulting in both strong and weak quarters 
as the chart below indicates  quarterly orders can vary significantly 
we believe that looking at our order level in any one quarter does not provide an accurate indication of our future expectations or performance 
rather  we believe that looking at our orders and backlog over a trailing twelve month period provides a better measure of our business 
our quarterly order levels and trailing twelve month order levels for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are set forth in the table below 
logo expected international growth in refining and chemical processing with domestic growth in chemical processing  nuclear power and us navy projects we expect growth in the refining and chemical processing capacity to be driven by emerging markets 
we also expect incremental investments in the domestic market for the refining market and renewed investment in the chemical processing market in north america 
we have also expanded our addressable markets with expansion of our business capabilities in the power market and our focus on us navy nuclear propulsion projects 
we believe our revenue opportunities during the near term will be equivalent between the domestic and international markets 
over the long term  we expect our customers markets to regain their strength and  while remaining cyclical  continue to grow 
we believe the long term trends remain strong and that the drivers of future growth include global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next two decades  primarily in emerging markets 
this is expected to offset estimated flat to slightly declining demand in north america and europe 
in addition  an increased trend toward export supply of finished product from the middle east to north america and europe is expected 

table of contents global oil refining capacity is projected to increase  and is expected to be addressed through new facilities  refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
increased demand is expected for power  refinery and petrochemical products  stimulated by an expanding middle class in asia and the middle east 
increased regulation worldwide  impacting the refining  petrochemical and nuclear power industries are expected to continue to drive requirements for capital investments 
more domestic refineries are expected to convert their facilities to use heavier  more readily available and lower cost crude oil as a feedstock 
lower costs are expected to drive increased domestic use of natural gas in the us  as well as the ability to export liquefied natural gas to serve other regions  since natural gas in the us is globally competitive with oil 
shale gas development and the resulting availability of affordable natural gas as feedstock to us based chemical petrochemical facilities is expected to lead to renewed investment in chemical petrochemical facilities in the us an expansion of the petrochemical market in the us is expected  given the plentiful supply and globally competitive price of natural gas 
construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east is expected to meet local demand 
increased development of geothermal electrical power plants in certain regions is expected to address projected growth in demand for electrical power 
increased investments in new power generation projects are expected in asia and south america to meet projected consumer demand increases 
long term growth potential in alternative energy markets  such as geothermal  coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  and waste to energy 
increased focus on safety and redundancy is anticipated in existing nuclear power facilities 
long term increased project development of international nuclear facilities is expected 
we believe that all of the above factors offer us long term growth opportunities to meet our customers expected capital project needs 
in addition  we believe we can continue to grow our less cyclical smaller product lines and aftermarket businesses 
our domestic sales as a percentage of aggregate product sales was in our fiscal year ended march  fiscal 
since fiscal  as the us market weakened  relative to international markets  domestic sales declined to of total sales in each of fiscal and in fiscal and  domestic sales increased to and  respectively  with our acquisition of energy steel  with sales primarily in the domestic market and expanded us navy work  which is exclusively in the us the us navy activity represents our production of surface condensers for the cvn gerald r 
ford class nuclear carrier order that was won in the third quarter of fiscal this project was in excess of  and is converting to revenue across multiple fiscal years 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 

table of contents the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share total assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  up  or  as compared with sales of  for fiscal domestic sales were  or of total sales  down from of total sales in fiscal domestic sales increased by in fiscal international sales accounted for  or of total sales for fiscal  up from of total sales in fiscal international sales increased  or compared with fiscal by market  sales for fiscal were to the refining industry  down from in fiscal  to the power markets  down from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries  up from in fiscal  and to other industrial applications including the us navy  the same as in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross margins in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal due to a few high margin projects which converted to sales in the first half of fiscal  and were won with pricing in line with the peak of the last upcycle 
gross profit for fiscal decreased  compared with fiscal selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense for fiscal was  up or  compared with  in fiscal however  this also included a reversal of a reserve for the potential earn out for year two of the energy steel acquisition 
the energy steel acquisition provided for a potential earn out to the seller of up to  per year for each of the first two full calendar years calendar years and that we owned energy steel 
the first year  calendar year  the earn out was achieved and paid to the seller in january the earn out for the second year  calendar year  had been partly reserved for at the time of acquisition with the remaining charges added subsequent to the acquisition 
however  due to lower order volume levels experienced in calendar year and project timing  the energy steel earn out criteria was not achieved 
as a result  the reserve of was adjusted to  and was recorded as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal sg a expense increased due to higher selling and commission cost and an increase in headcount  as we prepare for the anticipated continued recovery in our markets 
sg a as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal to of sales of sales excluding the reserve reversal noted above compared with of sales in fiscal interest income for fiscal was  down from in fiscal interest expense was a credit of in fiscal  down from in fiscal the decrease was due to the interest charges being reversed for a research and development tax credit audit resolution reached with the internal revenue service the irs 
it is our policy to recognize any interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense 
in the second quarter of fiscal  due to lower than expected assessments by the irs  we reversed provisions that had been made in earlier periods for interest related to previously uncertain tax positions 
the irs audit tax resolution is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k

fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  up  or  as compared with sales of  for the fiscal year ended march   which we refer to as fiscal the increase was driven by organic growth as well as the full year impact of our acquisition of energy steel 
organic sales grew  or  representing of the growth in fiscal sales from energy steel  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal december  increased  representing the remaining of the growth in fiscal all comparisons discussed include a full year of financial results for energy steel in fiscal compared with approximately months of energy steel financial results in fiscal domestic sales increased by  in fiscal  driven by the full year impact of energy steel  increased conversion of the us navy project and strong organic growth 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  down from in fiscal international sales increased by  in fiscal by market  sales for fiscal were to the refining industry  the same percentage as fiscal  but a larger dollar amount  to the power markets  including nuclear energy  up from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries  down from in fiscal  and to other industrial applications including the us navy  down from in fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross margin in fiscal improved compared with fiscal due to increased facility utilization at our batavia plant  stronger sales and pricing for short cycle orders and improved pricing on key projects resulting from strategic decisions regarding pricing 
gross profit for fiscal increased  compared with fiscal gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales as well as the improved gross margin level 
sg a expense for fiscal was  up compared with  in fiscal half of the increase in sg a was related to the full year impact of owning energy steel 
the remaining increase was due to the addition of staff to support current and future expected revenue growth 
sg a expense as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal to of sales compared with of sales in fiscal interest income for fiscal was  down from in fiscal this decrease was due to lower average levels of cash during fiscal compared with fiscal interest expense was in fiscal  up from in fiscal the increase was due to the interest expense recognized related to the energy steel acquisition earn out reversing the discounting calculations made when estimating the payment of the earn out as well as interest charges for a research and development tax credit audit resolution reached with the irs and other unrecognized tax benefits

table of contents stockholders equity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity that can be found in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the following table shows the balance of stockholders equity on the dates indicated march  march  march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income earned in fiscal on march   our net book value per share was  up over march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income earned in fiscal  offset by shares repurchased in fiscal a total of shares have been repurchased pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
at march  and  the number of shares remaining that had been approved for repurchase under the stock repurchase program was on march   our net book value per share was  up over march  liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets appearing in item of part ii of this annual report on form k march  cash and investments working capital working capital ratio working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities 
working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
we use the ratios described above to measure our liquidity and overall financial strength 
net cash generated by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal improvements in accounts receivable  accounts payable  income taxes payable and customer deposits as well as lower capital spending were partly offset by increased inventory and deferred taxes 
the increase in inventory was mix driven  with a similar level of gross inventory  but less of it offset by customer funded inventory purchases 
although capital spending in fiscal was  down from  in fiscal  we continued to invest in equipment to support our growth strategies 
capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and for all other items 
fifty nine percent of our capital spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
during fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares as part of our stock buyback program 
in fiscal  we used to repurchase shares of stock 
we paid in dividends in fiscal  up from in fiscal cash and investments were  on march  compared with  on march   up  or 
the largest components of cash generation were net income as well as improvements in overall working capital  specifically accounts receivable and accounts payable 

table of contents we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in either a money market account or in us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of up to days 
our money market account is used to securitize our outstanding letters of credit and allows us to pay a lower cost on those letters of credit 
approximately of our cash and investments are held in the us the remaining approximately is invested in our china operations 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between approximately  and  we are likely to spend near the upper end of this range if we are successful securing orders for the us navy s submarine program 
approximately of our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be for machinery and equipment  with the remaining amounts to be used for information technology and other items 
our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na provides us with a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
in addition  the agreement allows us to increase the line of credit  at our discretion  up to another  for total availability of  borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
there were no other amounts outstanding on our credit facility at march  and our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate  or 
availability under the line of credit was  at march  we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
contractual obligations as of march   our contractual and commercial obligations for the next five fiscal years ending march and thereafter were as follows total payments due by period less than year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases pension and postretirement benefits accrued compensation accrued pension liability liability for unrecognized tax benefits total for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
amounts represent anticipated contributions during the fiscal year ended march   which we refer to as fiscal  to our postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february   we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged 
we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
no contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plan for fiscal orders and backlog orders in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy included in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 

table of contents domestic orders were  or  and international orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal domestic orders decreased by  or  primarily due to two non repetitive large orders to provide products for the new nuclear reactors to be built in the southeast us  which were won in fiscal international orders decreased by  or  as we experienced strong orders in canada which were offset by lower orders in the middle east 
backlog was  at march   down compared with  at march  backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately to of orders currently in backlog are not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for power  including nuclear energy  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications including the order for the us navy 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for power  including nuclear energy  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
at march   we had no projects on hold 
we had one project for cancelled in fiscal for an existing nuclear facility in the us subsequent to march   an order in the amount of  was cancelled 
strategy and outlook we believe that we continue to be in the early stages of a recovery in the refinery and petrochemical markets 
while our pipeline has continued to expand throughout the past year  our order levels have yet to expand commensurately 
we believe that with stronger market conditions  we have the ability to double the size of our business over the next market upcycle 
we have invested to gain capacity  utilized our strong balance sheet to expand our power market position with the acquisition energy steel and have invested to expand the work we do for the us navy 
we intend to continue to look for organic growth opportunities as well as acquisitions or other business combinations that we believe will allow us to expand our presence in our existing and ancillary markets 
we are focused on reducing earnings volatility  growing our business during a market expansion and diversifying our business 
we believe that our successful growth in revenue and profitability during the last market upcycle that ended during our fiscal year ended march   along with the continued profitable operation of our business during the most recent downcycle  are evidence of the success of our strategy 
as the current fiscal year continues to unfold  we believe the improved strength of the energy markets will become more evident 
we believe that with our strong project pipeline  we are likely to see improved quarterly order levels  though the timing of that improvement is still uncertain 
we expect revenue to be approximately  to  in fiscal  a decrease to a increase as compared with fiscal our expected growth range for fiscal assumes conversion of backlog as well as continued market improvement and investment by our customers 
to achieve the upper end of the range  we will need to see strong order levels in the first half of the year 
the continued conversion to revenue of the us navy and two large nuclear projects is expected to contribute significantly to sales in fiscal any unexpected delay in any of these projects could impact fiscal revenue and earnings 
normally  we convert to of our existing backlog to sales within a month period 
however  we have three large projects which are converting over a multi year time period 
the us navy project and two large projects for the new nuclear reactors being built in the southeast us will partially convert in fiscal however  the reactor projects  as well as the us navy project  will continue into subsequent fiscal years 
these three projects make up approximately one third of our fiscal year end backlog 
therefore  our march  backlog will extend beyond our historical conversion level 
we expect to convert approximately to of our march  backlog to sales in fiscal we expect gross profit margin in fiscal to be in the to range 
while we continue to believe stronger activity in our key end markets  particularly the refining and petrochemical markets  is likely to occur  based on our pipeline  the recovery has been slower than we had originally anticipated 
therefore  margins have also been slow to recover and backlog has likewise been slow to build 
moreover  we have pre invested in operations and engineering personnel to prepare for current and future growth opportunities  which has the effect of increasing sg a and dampening short term margin improvement 

table of contents we continue to believe that as the recovery continues gross profit margins should improve with anticipated volume increases 
as we look forward  due to changes in geographic and end use market mix  we expect gross margins are unlikely to reach the range achieved in the prior up cycle 
we believe that at the peak of the current cycle a gross profit margin percentage in the mid to upper range is a more realistic expectation 
we also expect this recovery will continue to be more focused on emerging markets  which historically have provided more competitive pricing and  correspondingly  lower margins  than developed markets 
sg a spending during fiscal is expected to be between and of sales 
we continued to pre invest during fiscal in personnel as we prepare for increased opportunities in fiscal and beyond 
our effective tax rate during fiscal is expected to be between and cash flow in fiscal is expected to be positive  driven primarily by net income  partly offset by capital spending as well as a minimal need for additional working capital 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for immaterial amounts 
as of march   we are subject to the claims noted above  as well as other legal proceedings and potential claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of the lawsuits to which we are a party cannot be determined and an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made  we do not believe that the outcomes  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred as of a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately  when evident to management 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 
business combinations and intangible assets 
assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based upon detailed valuations that use various assumptions made by management 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if 
table of contents certain indicators are present 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
we file federal and state income tax returns in several domestic and international jurisdictions 
in most tax jurisdictions  returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities for a number of years after the returns have been filed 
during fiscal and fiscal  we reached resolutions with the irs with regard to the research and development tax credits claimed during tax years through  thereby reducing tax credits claimed  and interest was assessed on the underpayment of tax 
we paid all settlement amounts to the irs through tax years the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to the research and development tax credits was and on march  and march   respectively 
the liability at march  is related to tax years through for further discussion of our tax liabilities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  fair value estimates of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

table of contents as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize a substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows are discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the transaction and the time value of money 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  the high cost barrier to entry of markets  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
for more information on these matters see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits expense income is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal was for our defined benefit pension plan and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k related to revenue  contingencies  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in the normal course of business  management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec  the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants or any other authoritative accounting body to determine the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb amended its guidance related to the presentation of other comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires the presentation of other comprehensive income and its components either together with the components of net income in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or as a separate statement immediately following the statement of income with equal prominence 
the provisions of the amended guidance were effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and we elected to present comprehensive income in a separate statement 
in september  the fasb amended its guidance related to periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
effective april   we adopted this guidance which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the guidance permits an entity to choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of its reporting units 
an entity may also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative impairment test  and then perform the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
we perform our impairment test annually as of december we did not apply the qualitative assessment approach permitted in the guidance 
in july  the fasb amended its guidance related to periodic testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amended guidance is intended to reduce cost and complexity by providing an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 
the guidance also enhances the consistency of impairment testing among long lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset s fair value when testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment  which is equivalent to the impairment testing requirements for other long lived assets 
in accordance with the guidance  an entity will have an option not to calculate annually the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the provisions of the amended guidance are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of the amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance related to the disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance adds new disclosure requirements either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
this guidance gives companies the flexibility to present the information either in the notes or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements provided that all of the required information is presented in a single location 
this guidance is effective prospectively for annual and the interim reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as it only changes the disclosures surrounding aoci 
we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements  which have not already been adopted  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of march  or march   other than operating leases and letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from market changes to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  price risk and project cancellation risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate  price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 

table of contents foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales  up from of sales in fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  all sales for which we or our subsidiaries were paid were denominated in the local currency us dollars or chinese rmb 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our purchases in foreign currencies represented of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales and purchase contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or fiscal  and as of march  and  respectively  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 
price risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions 
although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence  among other things  such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices 
moreover  the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility 
such factors  in addition to the global effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products 
project cancellation and project continuation risk adverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers 
at march   we had no projects on hold 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred 
as a result  we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled 
open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers 
if it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date  management will move the project into placed on hold ie  suspended category 
furthermore  if a project is cancelled by our customer  it is removed from our backlog
