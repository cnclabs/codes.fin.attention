our company we are one of the world largest and oldest lessors of intermodal containers and chassis 
intermodal containers are large  standardized steel boxes used to transport freight by ship  rail or truck 
because of the handling efficiencies they provide  intermodal containers are the primary means by which many goods and materials are shipped internationally 
chassis are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
we operate our business in one industry  intermodal transportation equipment  and have two business segments equipment leasing we own  lease and ultimately dispose of containers and chassis from our lease fleet  as well as manage containers owned by third parties 
equipment trading we purchase containers from shipping line customers  and other sellers of containers  and resell these containers to container traders and users of containers for storage or one way shipment 
operations our consolidated operations include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of multiple types of intermodal containers and chassis 
as of december   our total fleet consisted of  containers and chassis  including  containers under management for third parties  representing  twenty foot equivalent units teus 
we have an extensive global presence  offering leasing services through approximately third party container depot facilities in countries as of december  our customers are among the world largest shipping lines and include  among others  apl nol  cma cgm  hapag lloyd  mediterranean shipping company and nyk line 
for the year ended december   our twenty largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  our five largest customers accounted for of our leasing revenues  and our largest customer accounted for of our leasing revenues

ceu is a ratio used to convert the actual number of containers in our fleet to a figure based on the relative purchase price of our various equipment types to that of a foot dry container 
for example  the ceu ratio for a foot standard height dry container is  and a foot high cube refrigerated container is the ceu ratios used in this calculation are from our debt agreements and may differ slightly from ceu ratios used by others in the industry 
we lease five types of equipment dry freight containers  which are used for general cargo such as manufactured component parts  consumer staples  electronics and apparel  refrigerated containers  which are used for perishable items such as fresh and frozen foods  special containers  which are used for heavy and oversized cargo such as marble slabs  building products and machinery  tank containers  which are used to transport bulk liquid products such as chemicals  and chassis  which are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
our in house equipment sales group manages the sale process for our used containers and chassis from our equipment leasing fleet and buys and sells used and new containers and chassis acquired from third parties 

table of contents as of december   the percentages of our equipment fleet in units and our leasing revenues by equipment type were as follows equipment type percent of total fleet units percent of leasing revenue dry refrigerated special tank chassis equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  finance leases and service leases 
long term leases  typically with initial contractual terms ranging from three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
we also have expired long term leases whose fixed terms have ended but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments pursuant to the terms of the initial contract 
some leases have contractual terms that have features reflective of both long term and service leases and we classify such leases as either long term or service leases  depending upon which features we believe are the most predominant 
the following table provides a summary of our equipment leasing fleet portfolio by lease type  based on ceus  as of the dates indicated below december  lease portfolio long term leases finance leases service leases expired long term leases units on hire total the increase in our service lease portfolio over the last year reflects the completion of several large sale leaseback transactions which are usually structured to provide customers with significant flexibility to redeliver units 
due to the age of this equipment  we expect to sell these units when they are redelivered 
as of december   and  our long term and finance leases had an average remaining contract term of approximately months  months and months  respectively  assuming no leases are renewed 

table of contents operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gains or losses that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 
our leasing revenues are primarily driven by the size of our owned fleet  our equipment utilization and the average lease rates in our lease portfolio 
our leasing revenues also include ancillary fees driven by container pick up and drop off volumes 
leasing revenues for the year ended december  increased from owned fleet size 
as of december   our owned fleet included  ceus with a net book value of  million  an increase of and respectively from december  the increase in our fleet size in was primarily due to our purchases of new containers and the completion of several large sale leaseback transactions  both of which were supported by a combination of moderate growth in global containerized trade volumes and the continued shift to leasing from container ownership by our shipping line customers 
clarkson estimates that global container liftings increased by in growth in the main lane east west trades was minimal  but strong growth in intra asia  north south and other regional trades led to moderately positive global trade growth and a need for additional container equipment 
demand for leased containers was further supported in by our customers increased reliance on leasing for both their existing container fleets and new container additions 
historically  our shipping line customers have generally purchased of the containers they operate and leased from leasing companies like tal 
however  since our customers have relied on leasing for the majority of the containers added to their fleets  and they have become increasingly interested in selling portions of their existing fleets of owned containers to leasing companies through sale leaseback transactions 
this increased reliance on leasing has been mainly driven by the financial challenges facing our customers due to persistent excess vessel capacity and the resulting pressure on freight rates  high fuel prices  and reduced access to financing 
during  we invested nearly million in our fleet  purchasing over  teus of new containers and over  teus of used containers through sale leaseback transactions 
leasing revenue growth in was slightly less than our fleet growth 
the pick up of new containers committed to leases was slower than anticipated  as expectations for trade growth diminished during the year and as peak season shipping volumes were lighter than expected 
many of our customers responded to this lower growth level by extending the time they took in completing committed pick ups of our containers 
in addition  a large portion of the sale leaseback transactions were completed and placed on hire in the second half of the year 
we also placed several orders for dry containers in the fourth quarter of that were primarily intended to support anticipated leasing demand in utilization 
our average utilization was for the full year of  a decrease of from the average for our utilization remained quite high in due to the general tight supply demand balance for containers and our customers reluctance to order large volumes of new containers directly 
we expect our utilization to decrease slightly in the first quarter of since the first quarter typically represents the weakest season for our dry container product line 

table of contents the following tables set forth our equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below quarter ended year ended december  average utilization december  september  june  march  ending utilization december  september  june  march  utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease in ceus by the total units in our fleet in ceus excluding new units not yet leased and off hire units designated for sale 
average lease rates 
average lease rates for our dry container product line decreased slightly in compared to this decrease was mainly the result of the completion of several large sale leaseback transactions for older dry containers 
these older containers were purchased for prices well below the current cost of new containers  and the leaseback rates are substantially below our current portfolio average 
excluding the effects of these sale leaseback transactions  average lease rates on our dry container product line increased in compared to the increase in average dry container lease rates in excluding the impact of sale leaseback transactions was mainly due to the steady increase in our average lease rates during new container prices were exceptionally high during and market leasing rates reached recent historical peak levels in the first half of the year 
in  lower new container prices and very low interest rates for financing structures used by leasing companies to fund new container purchases caused market lease rates to decrease from peak levels  and our average dry container lease rates held fairly steady in  excluding the impact of sale leaseback transactions 
lower new container prices and widespread availability of attractively priced financing for container leasing companies continue to pressure market lease rates  and market lease rates for dry containers are currently below our portfolio average 
because of this  we expect our average dry container lease rates to decrease slightly in the first part of as new units are picked up on lease 
average lease rates for refrigerated containers were lower in compared to our average lease rates for refrigerated containers were negatively impacted by the addition of new refrigerated containers placed on lease at rates lower than our portfolio average 
the cost of the refrigeration machines included in refrigerated containers has trended down over the last few years  which has led to lower refrigerated container prices and lease rates 
lease rates for new refrigerated containers are also being negatively impacted by aggressive pricing from new entrants seeking to build market share and the widespread availability of attractively priced financing for container leasing companies 
the average lease rates for special containers were approximately higher in compared to due to relatively high prices and lease rates for new special containers added to our fleet  and the drop off and sale of older special containers on leases with rates well below current market levels 
late in the fourth quarter  we completed a large sale leaseback transaction for older special containers 
we purchased these older containers for prices well below the current cost of new containers  and the leaseback rate is substantially below our current portfolio average 
we expect the average lease rates on 
table of contents our special containers to trend down in the first quarter of as a result of this sale leaseback transaction 
equipment disposals 
during  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to million in gain on sale decreased primarily due to lower average sale prices and the higher cost of equipment sold  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
the cost of equipment sold in was higher than in due to the substantial number of sale leaseback containers with higher book values sold during the year 
those sale leaseback containers had been purchased in the latter part of and second half of for prices higher than the typical book value of our older containers 
used container sale prices reached record levels during the summer of due to the general tight supply demand balance for containers and the high price for new containers at that time 
used container disposal prices trended down roughly from the peak to march as shipping line customers redelivered older containers after the peak season and the shortage of sale containers eased 
in the second half of  disposal prices stabilized  and remained quite high at the end of the year compared to historical averages and in relation to new container prices 
we expect used container sale prices to trend down further toward historical levels  but this may take some time if the container supply demand balance remains tight 
equipment ownership expenses 
our ownership expenses  which consist of depreciation and interest expense  increased by million or in compared to tal purchased a large volume of new containers in and  and our average revenue earning assets increased by approximately from to depreciation expense increased million or in compared to mainly due to the net increase in the size of our depreciable fleet  partially offset by another vintage year of equipment becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation expense would have increased an additional million in if we excluded the beneficial impact of a change in residual value estimates we implemented in the fourth quarter 
depreciation expense increased faster than our revenue earning assets in mainly due to our fleet demographics 
the portion of our fleet that is fully depreciated has decreased significantly as we have invested in a large number of new containers over the last several years and as a large volume of fully depreciated containers purchased in the mid s has been returned by customers and sold 
we purchased relatively few containers in the late s  so a relatively low volume of containers reached the end of their depreciable lives in and going forward we expect increases in our depreciation expense to be more in line with the growth in our revenue earnings assets 
after conducting our regular depreciation policy review  we decided to increase the estimated residual values used in our equipment depreciation policy 
the new residual value estimates were put into effect beginning october  we last changed our estimated residual values in the fourth quarter of due to the consistent excess of disposal prices over our estimated residual values 
since then  we have continued to experience relatively high gains on the sale of our equipment as disposal prices have remained well in excess of our residual values 
accordingly  we have increased the estimated residual values for certain of our major container types to be more reflective of our recent disposal history and our expectations for future used container sale prices 
over time  these higher residual value estimates will result in lower disposal gains and lower depreciation expense compared to what would have been reported using our previous residual value estimates 
as a result of our regular depreciation policy review  we have also decided to revise the estimated depreciation start date used in our leasing equipment depreciation policy 
under our revised estimate  depreciation on leasing equipment will begin on the date of initial on hire 
this policy change does not affect  but will have an impact on the first quarter of as new equipment purchased during and not yet placed in service will not begin depreciating on january  as it would have under our previous estimate 

table of contents interest expense increased million or in compared to this increase was due to an increase in our average outstanding debt  partially offset by a decrease in our average effective interest rate 
our average debt balance increased by to  million mainly due to new equipment purchases in and our average effective interest rate decreased by in compared to primarily due to the termination of interest rate swap agreements with higher interest rates and shorter maturities  and the replacement of those terminated agreements with longer term interest rate swap agreements that have lower fixed interest rates 
we use interest rate swap agreements to synthetically convert a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis to match the duration of our interest rates to the duration of our lease portfolio 
in addition  we issued new debt at interest rates lower than those on our existing facilities 
credit performance 
our credit performance remained strong during  and we recorded a million reversal of our provision for doubtful accounts 
however  our concern about credit risk remains heightened due to the difficult market conditions facing our shipping line customers 
during  excess vessel capacity placed severe pressure on freight rates on the major east west trade lanes 
higher fuel prices combined with the drop in freight rates to squeeze the profitability of our customers  and many reported large losses in and the first half of in general  the freight rate environment improved during as shipping lines focused on profitability rather than market share 
shipping lines were able to increase freight rates by managing excess vessel capacity through further slow steaming and idling 
as a result  shipping lines operating performance through the third quarter was markedly improved over however  shipping lines financial performance is likely to remain under pressure as it is anticipated that the volume of new vessels entering service over the next several years will be in excess of trade growth 
operating expenses 
our direct operating expenses were million in  compared to million in our direct operating expenses increased during mainly due to higher storage and repair costs resulting from a higher volume of redeliveries and slightly lower utilization  and increased inspection costs due to the higher volume of new units built and inspected during the year 
our administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of reflecting higher compensation costs 
the limited change in our administrative expenses over the last several years highlights the leverage we have over our fixed costs 
tal has existing business relationships with essentially all of the world major shipping lines  and our global operating infrastructure covers most of the world major export and import locations 
as a result  we have not needed to significantly grow our organization as we have rapidly grown our business 
over the last few years  the ratio of our administrative expenses to our leasing revenues decreased from in to in  and in 
table of contents dividends we paid the following quarterly dividends during the years ended december  and on our issued and outstanding common stock record date payment date aggregate payment per share payment december  december  million september  september  million june  june  million march  march  million december  december  million september  september  million june  june  million march  march  million historically  most of our dividends have been treated as a non taxable return of capital  and based on our current estimates we believe that of our dividends paid in will be treated as a non taxable return of capital to tal shareholders 
the taxability of the dividends to tal shareholders does not impact tal corporate tax position 
investors should consult with a tax advisor to determine the proper tax treatment of these distributions

per diem revenue increased by million  or  compared to the primary reasons for the increase in per diem revenue are as follows million increase due to an increase in the average number of units on hire 
this reflects an increase in the average number of units on hire from approximately  in to approximately  in  million increase due to the recognition of revenue during the first half of for the early termination of certain lease contracts  and million decrease due to lower average per diem rates 
the decrease in average per diem rates was primarily due to a million decrease resulting from lower average lease rates for refrigerated containers  which reflects the downward trend of the cost of refrigeration machines experienced over the last few years and aggressive pricing from new entrants seeking to build market share 
average lease rates for dry containers and chassis were million lower in due to the completion of large sale leaseback transactions for older dry containers at the end of the first half of this year 
these older containers were purchased for prices well below the current cost of new containers  and the leaseback rate is substantially below our current portfolio average 
average lease rates for dry and refrigerated containers were also negatively impacted by the widespread availability of attractively priced financing for container leasing companies 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million due to higher average lease rates for special containers

as long term interest rates have decreased  the current market rate on interest rate swap agreements with similar terms decreased relative to our existing interest rate swap agreements  which caused their fair value to decline 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in  compared to million in the effective tax rate was in and in while we record income tax expense we do not currently pay any significant federal  state or foreign income taxes due to the availability of net operating loss carryovers and accelerated tax depreciation for our equipment

asset backed securitization term notes our asset backed securitization abs facilities have been the primary funding source used to finance our existing container fleet and new container purchases 
under the facilities  our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries issue asset backed notes 
the issuance of asset backed notes is the primary business objective of those subsidiaries 
our borrowings under the abs facilities amortize in equal monthly installments 
the borrowing capacity under the abs facilities is determined by applying an advance rate against the sum of the net book values of designated eligible containers and accounts receivable for sold containers not aged more than days plus of restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to either or of original equipment cost  depending on the type of equipment 
advance rates under the abs facilities range from to 
we are required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in designated bank accounts equal to either five or nine months of interest expense depending on the type of facility 
term loan facilities we utilize our term loan facilities as an important funding source for the purchase of containers and other equipment 
the term loan facilities generally amortize in monthly installments 
the borrowing capacity under the term loan facilities is determined by applying an advance rate in the range of to against the net book values of designated eligible containers  which is determined under the terms of each facility 
asset backed warehouse facility the asset backed warehouse facility has a maximum borrowing capacity of million 
under the amended facility  funds are available on a revolving basis until august   after which if the facility is not refinanced  the notes will convert to term notes with a maturity date of august  
table of contents the term notes will amortize on a level basis over the four year term period to of the outstanding balance 
we primarily use the proceeds of this facility to finance the acquisition of equipment 
the borrowing capacity under the asset backed warehouse facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the sum of the net book values of designated eligible containers and accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days plus of restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating the company borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to either or of original equipment cost depending on equipment type 
the company is required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in a designated bank account equal to three months of interest expense 
revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility has a maximum borrowing capacity of million and matures on november  we are required to maintain unencumbered assets equivalent to of the maximum commitment 
capital lease obligations we have entered into a series of lease transactions with various financial institutions to finance chassis and containers 
each lease is accounted for as a capital lease  with interest expense recognized on a level yield basis over the period preceding early purchase options  if any  which is generally five to ten years from the transaction date 
debt covenants we are subject to certain financial covenants under our debt agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
below are the primary financial covenants to which we are subject minimum earnings before interest and taxes covenant ebit to cash interest expense  minimum tangible net worth tnw  and maximum indebtedness to tnw 
non gaap measures we primarily rely on our results measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in evaluating our business 
covenant ebit  cash interest expense  tnw  and indebtedness are non gaap financial measures defined in our debt agreements that are used to determine our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt agreements and should not be used as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
however  we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap information provides additional information to investors regarding our debt covenant compliance 
minimum covenant ebit to cash interest expense for the purpose of this covenant  covenant ebit is calculated based on the cumulative sum of our earnings for the last four quarters excluding income taxes  interest expense  amortization  net gain or loss on interest rate swaps and certain non cash charges 
cash interest expense is calculated based on interest expense adjusted to exclude interest income  amortization of deferred financing costs  and the difference between current and prior period interest expense accruals 
minimum covenant ebit to cash interest expense is calculated on a consolidated basis and for certain of our wholly owned special purpose entities spes  whose primary activity is to issue asset 
table of contents backed notes 
covenant ebit for each of our spes is calculated based on the net earnings generated by the assets pledged as collateral for the underlying debt issued 
the actual covenant ebit to cash interest expense ratio for each spe may differ depending on the specific net earnings associated with those pledged assets 
as of december   the minimum and actual consolidated covenant ebit to cash interest expense ratio and covenant ebit to cash interest expense ratio for each of the issuers of our debt facilities whose initial borrowing capacity was approximately million or greater were as follows entity issuer minimum covenant ebit to cash interest expense ratio actual covenant ebit to cash interest expense ratio consolidated tal advantage i  llc tal advantage ii  llc tal advantage iii  llc tal advantage iv  llc minimum tnw and maximum indebtedness to tnw covenants we are required to meet consolidated minimum tnw and maximum indebtedness to tnw covenants 
for the purpose of calculating these covenants  all amounts are based on the consolidated balance sheet of tal international group  inc tnw is calculated as total tangible assets less total indebtedness  which includes equipment purchases payable and  in certain cases  the fair value of derivative instruments liability 
for the majority of our debt facilities  the minimum tnw is calculated as million plus of cumulative net income or loss since january  as of december   the minimum and actual tnws for each of our spes were million and million  respectively 
as of december   the maximum and actual indebtedness to tnw ratios for each of our debt facilities whose initial borrowing capacity was approximately million or greater was as follows entity issuer maximum indebtedness to tnw ratio actual indebtedness to tnw ratio tal advantage i  llc tal advantage ii  llc tal advantage iii  llc tal advantage iv  llc as of december   our outstanding debt on facilities whose initial borrowing capacity was approximately million or greater was approximately  million 
failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the related credit agreements and could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the creditors

we are also obligated under various commercial commitments  including obligations to our equipment manufacturers 
our equipment purchase obligations are in the form of conventional accounts payable  and are satisfied from cash flows from operating and or long term financing activities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  does not include amounts potentially due under guarantees  as amounts  if any  are indeterminable contractual obligations by twelve month periods ending december  contractual obligations total and thereafter dollars in millions total debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases mainly facilities purchase obligations equipment purchases payable equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligations amounts include actual and estimated interest 
for floating rate debt  we have estimated interest based on december  rates and the net effect of our interest rate swaps 
amounts include interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically have initial contractual terms ranging from three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advance billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire  but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers considered to be non performing is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification no 
 revenue recognition asc  we recognize billings to customers for damages and certain other operating costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
as principal  we are responsible for fulfillment of the services  supplier selection and service specifications  and have ultimate responsibility to pay the supplier for the services whether or not it collects the amount billed to the lessee 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include an option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term for an amount determined to be a bargain 
equipment trading revenues and expenses equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of equipment purchased for resale and are recognized as units are sold and delivered to the customer 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
leasing equipment in general  we purchase new equipment from equipment manufacturers for the purpose of leasing such equipment to customers 
we also purchase used equipment with the intention of selling such equipment in one or more years from the date of purchase 
used units are typically purchased with an existing lease in place or were previously owned by one of our third party owner investors 
leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives and residual values of our leasing equipment are based on historical disposal experience and our expectations for future used container prices 
we review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in depreciation policies  useful lives of equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
after conducting our regular depreciation policy review  we decided to increase the estimated residual values used in our equipment depreciation policy 
the new residual value estimates were put 
table of contents into effect beginning october  we last changed our estimated residual values in the fourth quarter of due to the consistent excess of disposal prices over our estimated residual values 
since then  we have continued to experience relatively high gains on the sale of equipment as disposal prices have remained well in excess of residual values 
accordingly  we increased the estimated residual values for certain of our major container types to be more reflective of our recent disposal history and our expectations for future used container sale prices 
the estimated useful lives of all leasing equipment remain the same 
the estimated useful lives and residual values for the majority of our leasing equipment from the date of manufacture are as follows residual values useful lives years effective october  effective october  prior to october  dry containers foot foot foot high cube refrigerated containers foot foot high cube special containers foot flat rack foot open top tank containers chassis as a result of our regular depreciation policy review  we have also decided to revise the estimated depreciation start date used in our leasing equipment depreciation policy 
under our revised estimate  depreciation on leasing equipment will begin on the date of initial on hire 
this change had no impact in costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we charge to expense inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and include these costs in direct operating expenses 
if indicators of impairment are present  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of our fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
leasing equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recovered 
key indicators of impairment on leasing equipment include  among other factors  a sustained decrease in operating profitability  a sustained decrease in utilization  or indications of technological obsolescence 
when testing for impairment  leasing equipment is generally grouped by equipment type  and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities 
some of the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine future undiscounted cash flows and the measurement for impairment are the remaining useful life  expected utilization  expected future lease rates and expected disposal prices of the equipment 
we consider the assumptions on expected utilization and the remaining useful life to have the greatest impact on our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
these estimates are principally based on our historical experience and management judgment of market conditions 
an allowance is recorded in the provision for doubtful accounts for equipment on lease to customers considered to be non performing 
the allowance is based on a percentage of the net book 
table of contents value of equipment on hire to those customers that  based on historical experience  we believe will ultimately not be recovered 
equipment held for sale when leasing equipment is returned off lease  we make a determination of whether to repair and re lease the equipment or sell the equipment 
at the time we determine that equipment will be sold  we reclassify the appropriate amounts previously recorded as leasing equipment to equipment held for sale 
in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 property  plant and equipment asc  equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its estimated fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell  or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within days 
subsequent changes to the fair value of those assets  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments may not exceed the respective equipment carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net gain on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as net gain on sale of leasing equipment  and cash flows associated with the disposal of equipment held for sale are classified as cash flows from investing activities 
equipment held for resale trading activity on an opportunistic basis  we purchase equipment with markings or specifications different from our own equipment for purposes of reselling it for a net profit 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as equipment held for sale when the timeframe between when the equipment is purchased and when it is sold is expected to be short  generally less than one year 
cash flows associated with equipment purchased for resale having a short expected holding period are classified as cash flows from operating activities 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as leasing equipment when the timeframe between when the equipment is purchased and leased back to the seller  and when it is sold is expected to be one year or greater 
cash flows associated with equipment purchased for resale having a long expected holding period are classified as cash flows from investing activities 
equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of this equipment  while equipment trading expenses include the cost of equipment sold  any costs to sell such equipment  including administrative costs  and costs associated with the related inventory of equipment  such as storage and handling charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based upon a review of the collectability of our receivables 
this review is based on the risk profile of the receivables  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts  and economic conditions 
generally  we do not require collateral on accounts receivable balances 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in the receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in existing receivables 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 income taxes asc using the asset and liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing our ability to realize deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if applicable  we accrue income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions by evaluating whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in an audit and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
deferred financing costs deferred financing costs represent the fees incurred in connection with our debt obligations  and are amortized using the effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the related obligation  depending on the type of debt obligation to which they relate 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off when the related debt obligations are refinanced or extinguished prior to maturity  and are determined to be an extinguishment of debt 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc 
asc requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
in connection with the acquisition that occurred in  we recorded million of goodwill 
management determined that the company has two reporting units  equipment leasing and equipment trading  and allocated million and million  respectively  to each reporting unit 
we have elected to bypass the qualitative approach permitted under asc for testing goodwill for impairment  but may elect to perform the qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment in future periods 
the annual impairment test is conducted by comparing the company carrying amount to the fair value of the company using a market capitalization approach 
market capitalization of the entity is compared to the carrying value of the entity since virtually all of the goodwill is allocated to  and nearly all of the market capitalization is attributable to  the equipment leasing reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the entity exceeds its market capitalization  then a second step would be performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any excess fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our annual review of goodwill  conducted in the fourth quarter of  indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk in general  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates on a portion of our floating rate debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap agreements is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of one or more of our counterparties to perform their financial obligations under a derivative instrument 
all of our derivative instruments are with highly rated financial institutions 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative instrument to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   we had net interest rate swap agreements in place to fix the interest rates on a portion of our borrowings under debt facilities with floating interest rates as summarized below net notional amount weighted average fixed leg pay interest rate weighted average remaining term million years changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as net gains or losses on interest rate swaps as we do not apply hedge accounting treatment for these agreements 
during  our net loss on interest rate swaps was million  compared to million in since approximately of our floating rate debt is economically hedged using interest rate swap agreements  our interest expense is not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
however  a basis point increase in the interest rates on our floating rate debt primarily libor would result in an increase of approximately million in interest expense over the next months 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the large majority of our leases and obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in and were denominated in us dollars 
however we pay our us staff in local currencies  and certain of our direct operating expenses and disposal transactions for our older containers are structured in foreign currencies 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of million and million  respectively 
these losses resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates related to our euro and pound sterling transactions and related assets and liabilities 
in april  we entered into foreign currency rate swap agreements to exchange euros for us dollars based on expected payments under our euro denominated finance lease receivables 
the foreign currency rate swap agreements expire in april as of december  and  the 
table of contents fair value of these agreements were million and million  respectively  and are reported as assets in fair value of derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets
