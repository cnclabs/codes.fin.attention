table of contents page overview liquidity capital resources results of operations off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations overview general 
we are a self managed and self administered reit formed under the laws of the state of maryland 
we operate primarily in one segment  single tenant real estate assets  and our primary business is the investment in and acquisition  ownership  financing and management of a geographically diverse portfolio consisting of predominantly single tenant office  industrial and retail properties 
as of december   we had equity ownership interests in approximately consolidated real estate properties  located in states and encompassing approximately million square feet  approximately of which was leased 
a majority of these properties are subject to net or similar leases  where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs  including cost increases  for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and ordinary repairs 
our revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
as a result  growth in revenues and cash flows is directly correlated to our ability to acquire income producing real estate assets  re lease properties that are vacant  or may become vacant  at favorable rental rates and earn fee income 
since  we have seen an increase in acquisition opportunities and strengthening in the availability of capital 
however  our business continues to be impacted in a number of ways by the uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets  including a need to preserve capital  generate additional liquidity and improve our overall financial flexibility  our ability to find attractive financing  challenges in acquiring suitable property investments and tenant uncertainty with respect to future space needs 
however  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  the economy will fully recover 
in an effort to diversify our risk  we invest across the united states in properties leased to tenants in various industries  including finance insurance  technology  energy  automotive and consumer products 
however  industry declines  to the extent we have concentration  and general economic declines could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to corporate level borrowings  none of which matures in or  as of the date of filing this annual report  we have consolidated property specific non recourse mortgage debt with an aggregate of million and million in balloon payments that mature in and  respectively 
business strategy 
our current business strategy is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving our long term growth prospectus 
see business in part i  item of this annual report for a detailed description of our current business strategy 
we believe a positive impact continues to result from our business strategy 
in  we increased our net assets by approximately million as compared to in  we completed acquisitions build to suit transactions for an aggregate capitalized cost of approximately million and reduced our weighted average interest rate on outstanding consolidated indebtedness by approximately basis points primarily by refinancing higher interest rate debt 
in and  we reduced our overall consolidated indebtedness by million and million  respectively  primarily by repurchasing our exchangeable guaranteed notes and through the sale  transfer or other disposition of properties to third parties and lenders 
we expect our business strategy will enable us to continue to improve our liquidity and strengthen our overall balance sheet 
we believe liquidity and a strong balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise  which will create meaningful shareholder value 
investment trends 
making investments in income producing single tenant net leased real estate assets is one of our primary focuses 
the challenge we face is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising our real estate underwriting criteria 
we believe we have access to acquisition opportunities due to our relationships with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
when we acquire real estate assets  we look for general purpose office and industrial real estate assets subject to a long term net lease which have one or more of the following characteristics a credit worthy tenant  adaptability to a variety of users  including multi tenant use and an attractive geographic location 
commencing in  acquisition activity decreased as we focused on retiring senior debt and preferred securities to improve our balance sheet 
in response to the compression in capitalization rates for investment opportunities  we refocused our efforts into repurchasing our senior debt at what we believe were attractive and secure yields to maturity and disposing of real estate assets in compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to see an increase in our acquisition activity 
our acquisition volume for and consisted primarily of build to suit transactions whereby we provide capital to developers who are engaged in build to suit transactions and or commit to purchase the property from developers upon completion or acquire a property subject to a single tenant net lease and engage a developer to complete construction of a build to suit property as required by the lease 
we believe these arrangements offer developers and or tenants access to capital while simultaneously providing us with attractive risk adjusted projected yields 
we generally mitigate our cost exposure by requiring purchase agreements  development agreements and or loan agreements to specify a maximum price and or loan commitment amount prior to our investment 
cost overruns are generally the responsibility of the developer  or in some cases the prospective tenant 
to further mitigate risk  we believe we perform stringent underwriting procedures such as  among other items  requiring payment and performance bonds and or completion guarantees from developers and or contractors  engaging third party construction consultants and or engineers to monitor construction progress and quality  only hiring developers with a proven history of performance  requiring developers to provide financial statements and in some cases personal guarantees from principals  obtaining and reviewing detailed plans and constructions budgets  requiring a long term tenant lease to be executed prior to funding  and securing liens on the property to the extent of construction funding

we can provide no assurance with respect to the completion  cost or timing of these on going build to suit transactions 
loan investments 
we invest in loan assets secured by single tenant real estate assets  which we feel comfortable owning for our investment should the borrower default for reasons other than an underlying tenant default or are necessary for an efficient disposition of our equity interest in the property 
during the the year ended december   we entered into an arrangement to fund the construction of a charter school in homestead  florida 
the loan  which had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million as of december   matures in august and accrues interest at per annum 
during the fourth quarter of  we contracted to lend up to million for the construction of a data center in norwalk  connecticut 
the interest only loan bears interest at and matures in november the loan had an outstanding principal balance of million as of december  during  we loaned million to the buyer in connection with the sale of a vacant industrial property for million 
the loan was secured by the property  bore interest at and was satisfied in full in in  we made a million mezzanine loan secured by a pledge of all equity interests in the entities which owned two  to be constructed distribution facilities 
the loan was scheduled to mature in june and had an interest rate of for the first year and for the second year 
the loan was fully satisfied in november for a payment of million which included accrued interest and yield maintenance 
during and  we made a mortgage loan secured by an office building in schaumburg  illinois  which was scheduled to mature in january but could have been extended one additional year by the borrower for a basis point fee 
the mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  the property is leased through december  for an average annual rent of million 
the tenant made a claim for a million tenant improvement allowance  which is being offset by withholding rent 
the borrower defaulted on the mortgage loan and we have initiated foreclosure proceedings 
if we are successful on the foreclosure proceedings we will be required to pay the balance of the tenant improvement allowance 
during  we made a million loan secured by a combination of limited partner interests in entities that owned  and second mortgage liens or mortgage liens against  five medical facilities 
this loan was guaranteed by a parent entity and principal and initially matured in december and required payments of interest only at a rate of through february and thereafter 
the borrower prepaid an aggregate million in december and february in connection with the sale of certain collateral  and repaid the remaining million in december also as of december   the tenant of the property in westmont  illinois  which we sold in but issued a purchase mortgage to the buyer  exercised its option to terminate its lease effective november as of december   our note receivable was million 
despite the current economic uncertainty  we have seen an increase in our acquisition pipeline  mostly consisting of build to suit transactions 
we have several commitments and letters of intent for future acquisitions as of the first quarter of  and we anticipate continued acquisition activity for however  we can provide no assurances that any of these transactions will be consummated or  if consummated  will be successful 
leasing trends 
re leasing properties that are currently vacant or as leases expire at favorable effective rates is one of our primary asset management focuses 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are the period of time required to find a new tenant  whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  the significance of leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and the payment of capital expenditures and operating costs such as real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance with no offsetting revenue 
our property owner subsidiaries try to mitigate these risks by staying in close contact with our tenants during the lease term in order to assess the tenant current and future occupancy needs  maintaining relationships with local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
however  no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
generally  a tenant in a single tenant office property commences lease extension discussions well in advance of lease expiration 
if the lease has a year or less remaining until expiration  there is a high likelihood that the tenant will not extend the lease 
if a property cannot be re let to a single user and the property can be adapted to multi tenant use  we determine whether the costs of adapting the property to multi tenant use outweigh the benefit of funding operating costs while searching for a single tenant 
certain of the long term leases on properties in which we have an ownership interest contain provisions that may mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled fixed base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the leases on the single tenant properties in which we have an ownership interest require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the leases on single tenant properties in which we have an ownership interest are generally structured in a way that minimizes our responsibility for capital improvements 
since  tenants have been more aggressive in lease and lease renewal negotiations with respect to rental rate  tenant concessions and landlord responsibilities 
as a result  the obligations of our property owner subsidiaries on new leases and newly renewed or extended leases have generally increased to include  among other items  some form of responsibility for capital repairs and replacements 
during  we entered into new leases and lease extensions encompassing approximately million square feet 
the average gaap base rent on these extended leases was approximately per square foot compared to the average gaap base rent on these leases before extension of per square foot 
the weighted average cost of tenant improvements and lease commissions was approximately per square foot for new leases and per square foot for extended leases 
we expect renewal rents to be lower than expiring rents and tenant improvement allowance and leasing costs to remain at their current levels in the near future 
we continue to monitor the credit of tenants of properties in which we have an interest by subscribing to s p and moody  so that we can monitor changes in the ratings of our rated tenants  reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease  monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses and monitoring the timeliness of rent collections 
under current bankruptcy law  a tenant can generally assume or reject a lease within a certain number of days of filing its bankruptcy petition 
if a tenant rejects the lease  a landlord damages  subject to availability of funds from the bankruptcy estate  are generally limited to the greater of one year rent and the rent for  of the remaining term of the lease not to exceed three years rent 
a vacant property in each of tulsa  oklahoma and clive  iowa in which we had an interest were disposed of in foreclosure in our property owner subsidiaries may convey properties to lenders or the property owner subsidiary may declare bankruptcy in the future if a property owner subsidiary is unable to refinance  re let or sell its vacated property or if a tenant renews at a lower rent or a new tenant pays a lower rent that does not justify a value of the property in excess of the mortgage balance 
impairment charges 
during  and  we incurred impairment charges on our assets of million  million and million  respectively  due primarily to the assets being sold below their carrying value and a deterioration in economic conditions since the acquisition of such assets 
these real estate assets were primarily non core assets including retail properties  under performing and multi tenant properties 
given the continued uncertainty in general economic conditions  we cannot estimate if we will incur  or the amount of  future impairment charges on our assets

critical accounting policies 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require our management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
a summary of our significant accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this annual report and incorporated herein 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies  which require some of management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting 
the financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our consolidated subsidiaries 
we consolidate our wholly owned subsidiaries  partnerships and joint ventures which we control through voting rights or similar rights or by means other than voting rights if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  which we refer to as a vie 
entities which we do not control and entities which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are generally accounted for by the equity method 
significant judgments and assumptions are made by us to determine whether an entity is a vie such as those regarding an entity equity at risk  the entity equity holders obligations to absorb anticipated losses and other factors 
in addition  the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie requires judgment to determine the party that has power over the significant activities of the vie and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
judgments and estimates 
our management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our management best estimates and judgment 
our management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions 
our management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate 
the most significant estimates made include the recoverability of accounts receivable  allocation of property purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the determination of vies and entities that should be consolidated  the determination of impairment of long lived assets  loans receivable and equity method investments  valuation and impairment of assets held by equity method investees  valuation of derivative financial instruments and the useful lives of long lived assets 
purchase accounting and acquisition of real estate 
the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of fair value adjustments for assumed mortgage debt related to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and improvements and fixtures and equipment is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building and improvements based on our management determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by our management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  our management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
our management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and management estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods and bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationship values  is measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property over the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationship values based on management evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationships is amortized to expense over the applicable lease term plus expected renewal periods 
revenue recognition 
we recognize lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent if the renewals are not reasonably assured 
in those instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when we determine that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
the lease incentive is recorded as a deferred expense and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight line basis over the respective lease term 
determining if a tenant allowance is a lease incentive requires significant judgment 
we recognize lease termination payments as a component of rental revenue in the period received  provided that there are no further obligations under the lease  otherwise the lease termination payment is amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining obligation period 
all above market lease assets  below market lease liabilities and deferred rent assets or liabilities for terminated leases are charged against or credited to rental revenue in the period the lease is terminated 
all other capitalized lease costs and lease intangibles are accelerated via amortization expense to the date of termination 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized based on the specific timing of the sale as measured against various criteria related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
to the extent we sell a property and retain a partial ownership interest in the property  we recognize gain to the extent of the third party ownership interest 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections from our tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that we have identified 
impairment of real estate 
we evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible real estate assets for possible impairment when an event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset 
if such cash flows are less than the asset carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the asset carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
impairment of equity method investments 
we assess whether there are indicators that the value of our equity method investments may be impaired 
an investment value is impaired if we determine that a decline in the value of the investment below its carrying value is other than temporary 
the assessment of impairment is highly subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about our intent and ability to recover our investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment  including the level of our involvement therein  among other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated value of the investment 
loans receivable 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans  if circumstances warrant  to determine whether the loan is impaired 
a loan is considered to be impaired  when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
significant judgments are required in determining whether impairment has occurred 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loan effective interest rate  the loan observable current market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
interest on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis 
acquisition  development and construction arrangements 
we evaluate loans receivable where we participate in residual profits through loan provisions or other contracts to ascertain whether we have the same risks and rewards as an owner or a joint venture partner 
where we conclude that such arrangements are more appropriately treated as an investment in real estate  we reflect such loan receivable as an equity investment in real estate under construction in the consolidated balance sheets 
in these cases  no interest income is recorded on the loan receivable and we record capitalized interest during the construction period 
in arrangements where we engage a developer to construct a property or provide funds to a tenant to develop a property  we will capitalize the funds provided to the developer tenant and internal costs of interest and real estate taxes  if applicable  during the construction period 
the accounting for these critical accounting policies and implementation of accounting guidance issued in the future involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management current estimates 
liquidity general 
since becoming a public company  our principal sources of liquidity have been undistributed cash flows generated from our investments  the public and private equity and debt markets  including issuances of op units  property specific debt  corporate level borrowings  commitments from co investment partners and proceeds from the sales of our investments 
our ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon our existing leverage  the value of the assets we are attempting to leverage and general economic and credit market conditions  which may be outside of management control or influence 
cash flows 
we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  corporate level borrowings  capital recycling proceeds  issuances of equity  mortgage proceeds and our other principal sources of liquidity  will be available to provide the necessary capital required to fund our operations and allow us to grow 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows totaled million for  million for and million for cash flows from operations in was primarily impacted by the receipt of a lease termination payment on our lenexa  kansas property 
the underlying drivers that impact working capital and therefore cash flows from operations are the timing of the collection of rents and tenant reimbursements  loan interest payments from borrowers  and advisory fees  and the payment of interest on mortgage debt and operating and general and administrative costs 
we believe the net lease structure of the leases encumbering a majority of the properties in which we have an interest mitigates the risks of the timing of cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant 
collection and timing of tenant rents is closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by investing activities related primarily to proceeds from the sale of properties  collection of loans receivable  distributions from non consolidated entities in excess of accumulated earnings  proceeds from the sale of interests in non consolidated properties and changes in escrow deposits and restricted cash 
cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties  co investment programs and loans receivable  and an increase in deferred leasing costs  deposits and restricted cash 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of common shares  contributions from noncontrolling interests  non recourse mortgages and corporate borrowings  offset by dividend and distribution payments  repurchases of equity interests  forward equity commitment payments  net  an increase in deferred financing costs and debt payments and repurchases 
public and private equity and debt markets 
we access the public and private equity and debt markets when we believe conditions are favorable and have a compelling use of proceeds 
during  and  we raised net proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the issuance of common shares 
we primarily used these proceeds to retire indebtedness 
during  we issued an aggregate million of exchangeable guaranteed notes due in since  we repurchased and retired all notes for million in cash and million common shares having a value at issuance of million or per share 
during  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the notes pay interest semi annually in arrears and mature in january the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes in january  january and january for cash equal to of the principal of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
we may not redeem any notes prior to january  except to preserve our reit status 
thereafter  we may redeem the notes for cash equal to of the principal of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
as of the date of filing this annual report  the notes have a conversion rate of common shares per  principal amount of the notes  representing a conversion price of approximately per common share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  including increases in our dividend rate above a certain threshold and the issuance of stock dividends 
the notes are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances for cash  common shares or a combination of cash and common shares at our election 
during  holders of the notes converted an aggregate million of notes for million common shares and an aggregate cash payment by us of million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
during and  we repurchased and retired all outstanding series b preferred shares approximately million and approximately million series c preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  which was at a million discount to the liquidation preferences of the preferred shares 
during  we entered into a forward equity commitment to purchase million of our common shares at a price of per share and we agreed to make floating payments during the term of the forward purchase at libor plus basis points per annum and we retained all cash dividend payments 
we prepaid million of the million purchase price during and we settled the commitment in october for a cash payment of approximately million and retired approximately million common shares 
we may access these markets and other markets in the future to implement our business strategy and to fund future growth 
however  the continued general economic uncertainty and the volatility in these markets makes accessing these markets challenging 
upreit structure 
our upreit structure permits us to effect acquisitions by issuing op units to a property owner as a form of consideration in exchange for the property 
substantially all outstanding op units are redeemable by the holder at certain times on a one op unit for approximately common shares or  at our election  with respect to certain op units  cash 
substantially all outstanding op units require us to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units equal to the dividends paid to our common shareholders on an as redeemed basis and the remaining op units have stated distributions in accordance with their respective partnership agreement 
to the extent that our dividend per share is less than a stated distribution per unit per the applicable partnership agreement  the stated distributions per unit are reduced by the percentage reduction in our dividend 
we are party to funding agreements with our operating partnerships under which we may be required to fund distributions made on account of op units 
no op units have a liquidation preference 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests should be expected to decrease increase  as such op units are redeemed for our common shares 
as of december   there was a total of approximately million op units outstanding other than op units held by us 
of this total  approximately million are held by related parties 
as a result of the general deterioration in real estate values which commenced in  few sellers of real estate are seeking op units as a form of consideration 
property specific debt 
as of december   our property owner subsidiaries have related balloon payments of million and million maturing in and  respectively 
with respect to mortgages encumbering properties where the expected lease rental revenues are sufficient to provide an estimated property value in excess of the mortgage balance  we believe our property owner subsidiaries have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet these obligations through future cash flow from operations  the credit markets and  if determined appropriate by us  a capital contribution from us from either cash on hand million at december   borrowing capacity on our primary credit facility million as of december  
in the event that the estimated property value is less than the mortgage balance  the mortgages encumbering the properties in which we have an interest are generally non recourse to us and the property owner subsidiaries  such that a property owner subsidiary may  if appropriate  satisfy a mortgage obligation by transferring title of the property to the lender or permitting a lender to foreclose 
there are significant risks associated with conveying properties to lenders through foreclosure which are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
we expect to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages in certain situations as we believe that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with the terms of a lease  our cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
however  the current economic environment has impacted our ability to obtain property specific debt on favorable terms in many cases 
in  property specific mortgage lending nearly ceased 
since then  the number of lenders and available loan proceeds have diminished significantly 
in addition  the required loan to value ratios have decreased and the covenants  including required reserve amounts  have increased 
accordingly  we expect to primarily use corporate level borrowings to finance our acquisitions and debt maturities 
in and  we obtained  through consolidated property owner subsidiaries  million and million  respectively  in non recourse mortgage loans with interest rates ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from to corporate borrowings 
in  we procured a million secured term loan from wells fargo bank  national association  as agent 
the secured term loan matures in january and requires regular payments of interest only at an interest rate dependent on our leverage ratio  as defined therein  ranging from to over libor 
upon the date when we obtain an investment grade debt rating from at least two of s p  moody s and fitch  the interest rate under the secured term loan will be dependent on our debt rating 
we may not prepay any outstanding borrowings under the secured term loan facility through january   but may prepay outstanding borrowings anytime thereafter  however at a premium for the next three years 
we entered into aggregate interest rate swap agreements to fix libor at an aggregate weighted average rate of on million of borrowings under the secured term loan for seven years 
as of the date of filing of this annual report  million was outstanding  the collateral securing the term loan was released and we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the term loan agreement 
in addition  in  we refinanced our secured million revolving credit facility procured in january with keybank  as agent  with a million secured revolving credit facility 
the secured revolving facility required payments of interest at rates ranging from to over libor depending on our leverage ratios  as defined therein 
the secured revolving credit facility was to mature in january  but could be extended to january at our option 
see part i  item business  for disclosure relating to the refinancing of our secured credit facility with an unsecured credit facility and the amendment of our secured term loan to an unsecured term loan subsequent to december  as of the date of filing of this annual report  no amounts were outstanding on our unsecured credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our unsecured credit facility 
in march  we obtained million and million original principal amount secured term loans from keybank 
the loans were fully satisfied in january with proceeds from the secured term loan and our credit facility 
also in january  we fully satisfied the remaining million original principal amount outstanding of our exchangeable guaranteed notes due in obtained in during  we issued million in trust preferred securities  which bear interest at a fixed rate of through april and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus basis points through maturity 
these securities are classified as debt  due in and currently redeemable by us 
as of december  and  there were million of these securities outstanding 
while property specific mortgages have become harder to obtain  corporate level borrowings have generally been available and we expect this to continue to be the case in the near future 
we may seek a credit rating from certain credit agencies to improve the cost of our corporate level borrowings 
however  no assurance can be given that we will seek such a rating or what rating we may receive 
co investment programs and joint ventures 
we believe that entering into co investment programs and joint ventures with institutional investors and other real estate companies is a good way to access private capital while mitigating our risk in certain assets and increasing our return on equity to the extent we earn management or other fees 
however  investments in co investment programs and joint ventures limit our ability to make investment decisions unilaterally relating to the assets and limit our ability to deploy capital 
if we continue to grow  we expect to enter into co investment programs and joint ventures primarily with respect to assets that we ordinarily would not have invested in such  as non core assets 
we believe this mitigates our exposure to the risks inherent in non core assets 
in  we entered into two joint ventures which invested in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital and a retail property 
capital recycling 
part of our strategy to effectively manage our balance sheet involves pursuing and executing well on property dispositions and recycling of capital 
during  we disposed of our interests in properties  including a non consolidated property  for a gross price of million 
these proceeds were used to retire indebtedness encumbering properties in which we have an interest and make investments 
liquidity needs 
our principal liquidity needs are the contractual obligations set forth under the heading contractual obligations  below  and the payment of dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of op units 
as of december   we had approximately billion of indebtedness  consisting of mortgages and notes payable outstanding  convertible notes and trust preferred securities  with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the ability of a property owner subsidiary to make debt service payments depends upon the rental revenues of its property and its ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  or access capital from us or other sources 
a property owner subsidiary ability to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the risks described under risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
if we are unable to satisfy our contractual obligations and other operating costs with our cash flow from operations  we intend to use borrowings and proceeds from issuances of equity or debt securities 
if a property owner subsidiary is unable to satisfy its contractual obligations and other operating costs  it may default on its obligations and lose its assets in foreclosure or through bankruptcy proceedings 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we expect to continue paying regular dividends to our shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  we generally intend to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio  reserving such amounts as we consider necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in our portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as our board of trustees considers appropriate 
we paid approximately million in cash dividends to our common and preferred shareholders in although our property owner subsidiaries receive the majority of our base rental payments on a monthly basis  we intend to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by us in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
capital resources general 
due to the net lease structure of a majority of our investments  our property owner subsidiaries historically have not incurred significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain the properties in which we have an interest 
however  particularly since  as leases have expired  our property owner subsidiaries have incurred costs in extending the existing tenant leases  re tenanting the properties with a single tenant  or converting the property to multi tenant use 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
single tenant properties 
we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures at the single tenant properties in which we have an interest that are subject to net or similar leases since the tenants at these properties generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs 
however  at certain properties subject to net leases  our property owner subsidiaries are responsible for replacement and or repair of certain capital items  which may or may not be reimbursed 
at certain single tenant properties that are not subject to a net lease  our property owner subsidiaries have a level of property operating expense responsibility  which may or may not be reimbursed 
multi tenant properties 
primarily as a result of non renewals at single tenant net lease properties  we have interests in multi tenant properties in our consolidated portfolio 
while tenants are generally responsible for increases over base year expenses  our property owner subsidiaries are generally responsible for the base year expenses and capital expenditures at these properties 
vacant properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  our property owner subsidiary would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
if a property is vacant for an extended period of time  our property owner subsidiary may incur substantial capital expenditure costs to re tenant the property 
property expansions 
under certain leases  tenants have the right to expand the facility located on a property in which we have an interest 
in the past  our property owner subsidiary has generally funded  and in the future our property owner subsidiary intends to generally fund  these property expansions with either additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which was  and will be  funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties or capital contributions from us 
ground leases 
the tenants of properties in which we have an interest generally pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to our property owner subsidiary as increased rent 
however  our property owner subsidiaries are responsible for these payments under certain leases and at vacant properties 
environmental matters 
based upon management ongoing review of the properties in which we have an interest  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of these properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  changes in law  the conduct of tenants or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the properties in which we have an interest  will not expose us to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the tenants of properties in which we have an interest

without acquisitions  the sources of growth in net income are limited to index adjusted rents such as the consumer price index  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and variable rate indebtedness and by controlling other variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates and tenant monetary defaults and the other risks described in this annual report

funds from operations we believe that funds from operations  or ffo  which is a non gaap measure  is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
we believe ffo is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
as a result  ffo provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization  providing perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
nareit clarified its computation of ffo to exclude impairment charges on depreciable real estate owned directly or indirectly 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we present reported company ffo  which differs from ffo as it includes our op units  our series c preferred shares  and our convertible notes  because these securities are convertible  at the holder option  into our common shares 
management believes this is appropriate and relevant to securities analysts  investors and other interested parties because we present reported company ffo on a company wide basis as if all securities that are convertible  at the holder option  into our common shares  are converted 
we also present company ffo  as adjusted  which adjusts reported company ffo for certain items which we believe are non recurring and not indicative of the operating results of our real estate portfolio 
we believe this is an appropriate presentation as it is frequently requested by security analysts  investors and other interested parties 
since others do not calculate funds from operations in a similar fashion  reported company ffo and company ffo  as adjusted  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by others 
reported company ffo and company ffo  as adjusted  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

the real estate investments owned by these entities are generally financed with non recourse debt 
non recourse debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the assets collateralized by the debt 
the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the members or partners of the borrower  except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents 
these exceptions generally relate to bad boy acts  including fraud and breaches of material representations 
we have guaranteed such obligations for certain of our property owner subsidiaries 
we have also agreed to indemnify a third party for any draws on a letter of credit securing similar non recourse exceptions with respect to an investment we formerly owned but now manage 
upon expiration of such letter of credit  we have agreed to deliver a replacement million letter of credit 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  s and thereafter total notes payable interest payable fixed rate operating lease obligations includes balloon payments 
amounts shown exclude a debt discount of million and exclude million in outstanding letters of credit 
includes ground lease payments and office rents 
amounts disclosed do not include rents that adjust to fair market value 
in addition certain ground lease payments due under bond leases allow for a right of offset between the lease obligation and the debt service and accordingly are not included 
in addition  we guarantee certain tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions on behalf of certain property owner subsidiaries when required by the related tenant or lender 
however  we do not believe these guarantees are material to us as the obligations under and risks associated with such guarantees are priced into the rent under the lease or the value of the property 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to our variable rate debt and fixed rate debt 
as of december  and  we had no consolidated variable rate indebtedness not subject to an interest rate swap agreement 
during and  our variable rate indebtedness had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher  our interest expense for and would have been increased by approximately million and thousand  respectively 
as of december  and  our consolidated fixed rate debt was approximately billion and billion  respectively  which represented of total long term indebtedness in each year 
for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values 
the following fair values were determined using the interest rates that we believe our outstanding fixed rate debt would warrant as of december  and are indicative of the interest rate environment as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we estimate that the fair value of our fixed rate debt is billion as of december  our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
we generally enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of the date of filing this annual report  we have five interest rate swap agreements in our consolidated portfolio
