the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy staar s strategy is to be valued as a leading global provider of innovative intraocular lens system technologies 
staar employs a commercialization strategy that focuses on achieving sustainable profitable growth 
performance against key operational metrics two principal strategic goals guided staar s key operational metrics in to lay the groundwork for further growth and to achieve and maintain profitability 
in pursuit of these goals  staar aligned its business initiatives during along five key operational metrics that it used to gauge its performance during the year 
based on performance relative to our targets  on august   staar decreased the targets for three of the five metrics  and in final form they are as follows increase total revenue by high single digits for the full year 
as discussed below in results of operations  our total revenue increased by in grow icl sales by for the second half of and for the full year 
as discussed below in results of operations  icl sales grew for the second half of and for the year 
increase gross profit margins to achieve a level of for the full year 
as discussed below in results of operations  gross profit margins increased from in to in achieve profitability in three quarters of as discussed below in results of operations  we achieved profitability on a gaap basis only in the first quarter of manage the manufacturing consolidation with no material disruption to customer supply requirements 
our consolidation efforts proceeded according to our plans and we expect this to continue during as a result of certain consolidation related expenses being pulled forward from  spending levels were higher than projected for the year ended december  other highlights general in  staar increased its investment in the future by increasing research and development expense by over prior year to of net sales 
we expect this investment to result in revenue enhancing  patent protected next generation products 
staar also increased its investment in its sales and marketing teams by hiring new sales and marketing employees domestically and throughout our top eleven global refractive markets 
the new marketing employees are focusing on enhancing global consumer awareness initiatives for the icl product line  expanding social media messaging  including a redesigned web site  increasing support for icl awareness campaigns and added consumer marketing in the asia pacific region 
these new hires  along with their increased marketing activities  resulted in a increase in sales and marketing expense 
in addition  during staar transitioned its sales efforts in spain from a distributor to direct sales model and incurred approximately million in transition expenses related to this change 
staar also increased its manufacturing consolidation efforts in in preparation of transferring swiss and japanese manufacturing activities to our monrovia facility 
these non recurring consolidation and facility expansion efforts increased our expenses by million over consolidation efforts in global visian icl and ticl sales staar is the only company with approval to sell a posterior segment phakic iol  known as the icl 
in  sales of the icl products represented approximately of staar s business 
staar continues to focus its icl marketing and sales efforts in the top eleven refractive markets  based on the success of this strategy from through these markets include the us  japan  korea  china  india  spain  middle east  germany  italy  uk  and latin america 
in september  staar launched the vc model of the icl with centraflow technology  the ks aquaport in countries that recognize the ce mark 
the centraflow technology uses a proprietary port in the center of the icl optic of a size intended to optimize the flow of fluid within the eye  and eliminates the need for the surgeon to perform a yag peripheral iridotomy procedure days before the icl implant or a surgical iridotomy at time of implant 
by simplifying the procedure and increasing patient comfort  the icl with centraflow technology makes the superior visual outcomes of the icl available through a surgical implantation experience closer to lasik  which should attract new surgeons and patients to the product 
the launch of iclvc follows the september introduction of the iclvb model  which offers an expanded range of correction  in territories that recognize the ce mark 
the expanded range includes icls with lower levels of myopia correction in quarter diopter increments  toric hyperopic icls to treat astigmatism and far sightedness  and toric icls in the low to zero range of myopia to treat patients primarily affected by astigmatism 
these product line extensions more than double the number of patients who could benefit from products in europe and other territories that accept the ce mark 
staar believes that increased regulatory approval of the icl with centraflow technology beyond countries that recognize the ce mark  such as korea  india and latin america  will improved the competitiveness of the icl product line and help move staar closer to its goal of positioning the icl and ticl throughout the world as primary choices for refractive surgery 
icl products now address  in countries where approved  all degrees of refractive error that can be treated with laser eye surgery  as well as moderate and severe errors beyond the effective range of laser eye surgery 
in some key markets of the asia pacific region  as well as the us  staar has not yet introduced the iclvb model 
in those countries  staar is seeking approval of the icl with centraflow technology and plans to move directly to that model as quickly as regulatory timelines allow 
staar s ability to maintain or accelerate the rate of growth in icl sales will partly depend on continued improvement in worldwide economic conditions and progress with regulatory agencies 
icl surgery is a relatively expensive elective procedure and is seldom reimbursed by insurers or government agencies 
staar believes that the global recession reduced overall demand for refractive surgery particularly in the us  and it has been reported that consumer spending and consumer confidence has not returned to pre recession levels 
we consider icl sales growth in the us market important because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived worldwide leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
the icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december  staar submitted a pre market approval application supplement for the toric icl to the fda on april   and that application remains open and pending see  item  regulatory requirements in the united states  status of ticl submission 
on october   staar submitted to the fda a day pma supplement regarding the icl with centraflow technology 
after discussion with the fda  we agreed to resubmit the supplement as a pre submission prior to submitting a revised pma supplement 
spain has long been a large icl market in europe for staar 
because staar believes the potential of the spanish market has not been fully realized  staar decided to shift from its independent distributor to a direct sales model when the distributor s contract expires in in the second quarter of  staar had an opportunity to negotiate an early transition to the direct model  with the existing distributor to provide transitional services and ongoing logistics support for a fee 
while the transition caused a short term decline in revenues as the independent distributor ceased purchasing inventory and staar bought back the existing distributor inventory  staar believes that future revenues from spain will increase through enhanced direct marketing efforts and by selling directly to customers 
additional transition expenses will be incurred during the transitional period until march and logistic expenses to our former distributor through the first quarter of the on going weakness and uncertainty in the spanish economy may affect the magnitude and timing of these future benefits 
since  staar experienced noteworthy growth in market penetration in china and korea 
however  in february  it was widely reported throughout the asia pacific region that dr 
ray tsai  a prominent ophthalmologist in taiwan questioned the safety of lasik surgery  and would no longer perform the procedure 
we believe this negative publicity decreased patient interest in china in lasik as well as all other refractive surgeries 
in addition  economic concerns in korea as well as price competition among lasik procedure centers adversely impacted our sales in korea 
our distributor adjusted inventory levels 
we expect sales to increase in china and korea in while no assurance can be given regarding sales  through the first two months of  our sales in korea increased over the first two months of global iol sales 
staar pioneered the development of folding lenses for use in cataract surgery  and iols represented approximately of staar s business in in september  staar launched its nanoflex collamer single piece iol which can be injected through a mm incision with the nanopoint injector system  in the territories that recognize the ce mark 
staar received ce mark approval to market its nanoflex toric iol in november  and expects to begin marketing the lens in nanoflex is staar s largest selling iol product in us markets and staar believes the lens can receive broad commercial acceptance outside the us staar hopes that the biocompatibility and outstanding optical properties of collamer  with which surgeons have become acquainted through the icl  will build interest in the nanoflex iol worldwide 
availability of the toric version of the lens  which corrects pre existing astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery  is expected to increase interest in the nanoflex technology outside the us in may   staar included in its annual report to the fda notification of changes to the lens length and haptic design for the nanoflex iol 
on september   the fda responded that we should submit these changes as a pma supplement 
on november   staar amended its annual report to not include the modified nanoflex 
the company is assessing its options regarding the modified nanoflex iol in the us  while it continues to sell the current version 
staar has marketed its silicone toric iol since and believes that the addition of the nanoflex toric will make the product line more competitive with acrylic toric iols now in the market 
among other things  the nanoflex toric features an aspheric optic  and we believe the bio adhesive nature of the collamer material will provide excellent rotational stability  a key characteristic for toric lenses 
in the fourth quarter of  staar launched in japan and select markets in europe a hydrophobic acrylic preloaded iol  featuring the popular single piece iol format  known as the ks sp 
the market favorably received the ks sp and we received higher demand than originally forecasted 
due to manufacturing capacity constraints occurring at our third party acrylic lens supplier  we currently are experiencing a backlog for the ks sp  as well as the ks x 
the supplier cannot estimate whether or when their expanding manufacturing capabilities will be able to meet our increasing supply requirements 
while we are exploring supply alternatives  there is no guaranty we will identify and validate an alternative supplier 
among staar s initiatives to grow its iol business are the following we plan to introduce a preloaded injector for the nanoflex and nanoflex toric  we are seeking approval to introduce the silicone preloaded iol in the us market to enhance our us iol offering and help staar maintain or increase its market share in the hospital based segment  we plan to seek further approvals for the nanoflex and nanoflex toric in an effort to build a global product franchise for collamer iols  and we are researching presbyopia correcting designs that leverage the unique optical properties of the collamer material 
staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays and  in some cases  approval of regulatory authorities 
manufacturing consolidation project and tax strategy 
during staar devoted significant resources to two initiatives a project to consolidate global manufacturing  and development of a strategy to optimize our global organization for tax purposes 
the goal of these strategies is to further improve upon gross profit margin by streamlining operations  thereby reducing costs and to increase profits in the us to enable the company to utilize its million in net operating loss carryforwards  and at the same time  reduce income taxes in foreign jurisdictions where it pays tax 
staar currently manufactures its products in four facilities worldwide 
it has developed a plan to methodically consolidate its manufacturing in a single site at its monrovia  california location by the end of  which is expected subsequently to yield significant savings in cost of goods and to lower our global administrative and regulatory costs 
by december  all non sterile iols were manufactured in the us  whereas they were previously manufactured in japan 
in december  the company began the first manufacturing icls in the us  whereas they were previously exclusively manufactured in switzerland 
while some us manufactured iols were sold in december  sales of us manufactured iols and icls will comprise a larger portion of our sales in this project  which is subject to significant risks  is further described under risk factors  our manufacturing consolidation plan exposes us to risk 
staar expects its manufacturing consolidation initiatives to cost approximately million over a three year period  of which it spent approximately million during expenditures to date have largely consisted of severance  employee costs  professional fees to advisors and consultants and accruals for asset retirement obligations 
additionally  we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures to consolidate our manufacturing 
in august  staar entered into an eight year lease of an approximately  square foot building immediately adjacent to our current facility in monrovia  california 
the new building  which is accessible from the current facility via two hallways  will allow the company to accommodate the needs associated with our previously announced manufacturing consolidation to monrovia  as well as provide space for additional growth 
the company estimates the annualized cost of the new facility will increase selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in addition  as staar s profitability grows  its liability for income taxes in various jurisdictions has also increased 
staar has developed a strategy to minimize its future tax liabilities as its business grows 
among other things  staar seeks to utilize the approximately million in net operating losses that it has accumulated in the us however  we cannot assure that we will achieve the expected benefits of these initiatives 
among other things  costs could exceed current estimates  product manufacturing transfers can result in delays or supply interruptions  changes in tax laws could reduce or eliminate expected benefits of some or our tax strategies  and future profit margins can be affected by a variety of factors unrelated to our level of manufacturing efficiency 
backlog 
the icl is manufactured to precisely address refractive prescriptions across a broad range of correction  resulting in a large number of stock keeping units skus 
the challenge of maintaining inventory in all models  can result in a backlog in customer orders 
while the dollar amount of backlog orders is not currently significant in relation to our total annual sales  unexpectedly large orders for icls could increase our backlog 
staar believes it has sufficient capacity to ramp up production levels to meet demand and that any backlogs will be temporary 
however  delays in filling orders can result in lost sales if alternative refractive treatments are available to the patient 
because toric icls treat an even greater variety of refractive errors and at times must be custom made for the patient  they are accustomed to a special order procedure and do not expect immediate delivery of toric icls from inventory 
in connection with our manufacturing consolidation project  we have built a safety stock of inventory of our primary products within the icl and iol product lines 
our pre loaded single piece acrylic iol is currently experiencing backlogs due to high demand and manufacturing capacity constraints occurring at our third party acrylic lens vendor 
although the supplier is working to resolve the issue  they cannot estimate whether or when their manufacturing capabilities will be able to meet our increasing supply needs 
while we are exploring supply alternatives  there is no guaranty we will identify and validate an alternative supplier 
status of us ticl submission 
as discussed above under the caption business regulatory matters  staar submitted a pre market approval application pma supplement for the ticl to the fda on april   which the agency has designated as a panel track supplement 
on november   staar received a letter of deficiency from fda further questioning the clinical data  specifically the inclusion of patient data that was obtained outside the study windows  requesting additional information on the lens design and a validation report for the toric icl power calculation software 
after further interactions with the fda throughout  on november   staar submitted clinical data showing no statistical difference in the clinical outcomes with or without the patient data that was obtained outside the study windows  engineering data regarding the lens design  and a validation report for the toric icl power calculation software 
the us represents the largest refractive procedure market and staar will continue to seek approval 
staar cannot predict when  or if  the fda may grant approval of the toric icl 
financing strategy on december   in response to an offer made by the bank  staar japan amended its existing line of credit agreement with mizuho bank 
the amended agreement authorizes the company to increase its borrowings from up to  yen approximately million based on the exchange rate on december   at an interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately as of december  plus  for a total effective rate of  to a new limit of  yen approximately million based on the exchange rate on december   at a lower interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately as of december  
the credit facility may be renewed for an agreed upon term the current line expires on march  
the credit facility is not collateralized 
the company had  yen outstanding on the line of credit as of december  and december  approximately million based on the foreign exchange rates on december   and increased its amount outstanding on the line of credit to  yen approximately million based on the exchange rate on december  on december  in  the company paid approximately  in interest expense related to its borrowings from mizuho and the company expects its interest expense on the bank line to remain approximately the same in while there are no assurances  the company believes the credit line will be renewed in fiscal  similar to the renewals that have occurred since results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period

changes in foreign currency did not materially impact our net sales for the year 
net sales for were million  a increase over the million reported in fiscal the increase in net sales was due to increase in our core product sales iol and icl 
core products represented and of the company s total sales in fiscal year and  respectively 
changes in foreign currency favorably impacted our net sales in by million 
total iol sales were million for fiscal  a decrease from fiscal sales of million 
the primary reason for the decrease was a decrease in us iol sales volume 
the effect of the decrease in unit volume was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices 
preloaded iol sales in international markets decreased  despite a increase in unit volume  because of a decline in average selling prices due to a mix shift to preloaded acrylic iols which have lower average selling prices than most other iol models 
iol sales represented of the company s total sales in fiscal preloaded iol sales represented of total iol sales in fiscal total iol sales were million for fiscal and  respectively 
increased sales of preloaded acrylic iols in china and germany and toric iols in the us were offset by decreased collamer and silicone iol sales 
although iol sales were essentially flat year over year  iol margins were up due to improved average selling prices  costs  and geographic mix 
as an example  sales of our largest selling iol  the preloaded silicone iol  were down year over year 
however  preloaded iol gross profit was up due to higher sales in japan where margins are high and lower sales in europe where margins are low 
iol sales represented and of the company s total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
preloaded iol sales represented of total iol sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal total icl sales for were million  a increase over the million in fiscal unit volume increased and average selling prices increased 
icl sales growth was lower than anticipated due to an decrease in icl sales in korea as the distributor adjusted its inventories levels

the following table presents our marketing and selling expense for the fiscal years presented dollars in thousands marketing and selling expense    percentage of sales marketing and selling expense in fiscal was million or of sales  compared with or of sales in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense was due to the addition of employees during to support the company s icl growth initiatives in asia pacific  europe  and the us and to support global marketing efforts 
marketing and selling expense in fiscal was million or of sales  compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase in marketing and selling expense was due to increased headcount to support sales growth internationally and increased global promotional costs  partially offset by decreased costs in australia resulting from the transition of the business to an independent distribution model 
the following table presents our research and development expense for the fiscal years presented dollars in thousands research and development expense    percentage of sales research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products and the regulatory and clinical activities required to acquire and maintain product approvals globally 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expense in fiscal was million or of sales  compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase in expense is due to an increase in compensation costs  including stock based compensation and due to new product development activities 
the company expects to spend approximately of sales on research and development activities in research and development expense in fiscal was million or of sales  compared with million or of sales in fiscal the increase in expense is due to increased headcount and salaries  travel  and patent legal expenses 
the following table presents other general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years presented dollars in thousands other general and administrative expenses   percentage of sales other general and administrative expenses in fiscal of million compared with million in fiscal represent costs associated with the company s plans to consolidate its manufacturing operations 
this expense was higher than originally planned for the year due to a change in the timing of severance accruals 
overall the project is still expected to be completed generally on budget and on time 
the company expects to spend approximately to million on the project during other general and administrative expenses in fiscal of million represent costs associated with the company s plans to consolidate the manufacturing operations currently conducted in switzerland  japan  and aliso viejo  california  into its monrovia  california location 
these costs include consulting and tax services  accruals for asset retirement obligations  severance  and certain employee costs  including travel

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through operating cash flows  the issuance of common stock and proceeds from stock options and by relying on equipment and other commercial financing 
during  and for the foreseeable future  we will be highly dependent on our net product revenue to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations 
we may  in the future elect  to supplement this with further debt or commercial borrowing the company believes its current cash balances coupled with cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including cost and capital associated with the company s plans to consolidate manufacturing 
staar s need for working capital  and the terms on which financing may be available  will depend in part on its degree of success in maintaining positive cash flow through the strategies described above under the caption strategy

we planned for this increase to provide safety stock during our manufacturing consolidation project 
shelf registration in august  staar filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement covers the future public offering and sale of up to million in equity or debt securities or any combination of such securities 
staar currently has no plans to issue any securities under the shelf registration statement 
among the purposes for which staar could use the proceeds of securities sold in the future under the shelf registration statement are working capital  capital expenditures  expansion of sales and marketing  and continuing research and development 
staar could also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses  assets  products and technologies that are complementary to our own  although we are not currently contemplating or negotiating any such acquisitions or investments 
the availability of financing in the public capital markets through the shelf registration statement depends on a number of factors in place at the time of financing  including the strength of staar s business performance  general economic conditions and investment climate  and investor perceptions of those factors 
if staar seeks financing under the shelf registration statement in the future  we cannot assure that such financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
credit facilities  contractual obligations and commitments credit facilities the company has credit facilities with different lenders to support operations as detailed below 
line of credit the company s wholly owned japanese subsidiary  staar japan  has an agreement  as amended on december   with mizuho bank which provides for borrowings of up to  yen approximately million based on the rate of exchange on december   at an interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately as of december  and may be renewed annually the current line expires on march  
the credit facility is not collateralized 
in case of default  the interest rate will be increased to per annum 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes the credit line will be renewed in fiscal the company had  yen and  yen outstanding on the line of credit as of december  and december   approximately million and million based on the foreign exchange rates on december  and december   respectively which approximates fair value due to the short term maturity and market interest rates of the line of credit 
as of december   there were no available borrowings under the line 
in august  the company s wholly owned swiss subsidiary  staar surgical ag  entered into a credit agreement with credit suisse the bank 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  chf swiss francs  at the rate of exchange on december   to be used for working capital purposes 
accrued interest and commissions on average outstanding borrowings is payable quarterly and the interest rate will be determined by the bank based on the then prevailing market conditions at the time of borrowing 
the credit agreement is automatically renewed on an annual basis based on the same terms assuming there is no default 
the credit agreement may be terminated by either party at any time in accordance with its general terms and conditions 
the credit facility is not collateralized and contains certain conditions such as providing the bank with audited financial statements annually and notice of significant events or conditions as defined in the credit agreement 
the bank may also declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable upon a change of control or a material qualification in staar surgical ag s independent auditors report 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  and the full amount of the line was available for borrowing 
covenant compliance the company is in compliance with the covenants of its credit facilities and lines of credit as of december  contractual obligations the following table represents the company s known contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years more than years line of credit   capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations    pension obligation  severance  open purchase orders total      critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company records revenue from non consignment product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  which is typically at shipping point  except for our staar japan subsidiary  which is typically recognized when the product is received by the customer 
staar japan does not have significant deferred revenues as delivery to the customer is generally made within the same or the next date of shipment 
our products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
we maintain title and risk of loss on consigned inventory 
we recognize revenue for consignment inventory when we are informed the iol has been implanted and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate 
we present sales tax we collect from our customers on a net basis excluded from our revenues 
we ship icls only for use by surgeons who have already been certified  or for use in scheduled training surgeries 
for all sales  we are the principal in the transaction as we  among other factors  bear general inventory risk  credit risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price and bear authorized sales returns inventory risk 
therefore  sales are recognized gross with corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations instead of a single  net amount 
cost of sales includes cost of production  freight and distribution  royalties  and inventory provisions  net of any purchase discounts 
we generally permit returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by our return policies  and in good condition 
we provide allowances for sales returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of  among other factors  historical returns experience and trends  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  the entry of a competitor  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
we consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
sales are reported net of estimated returns 
if the actual sales returns are higher or lower than estimated by management  additional reduction or increase in sales may occur 
we maintain provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
we write off amounts determined to be uncollectible against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected term of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
accounting for warrants 
we account for the issuance of company derivative equity instruments such as the warrants  in accordance with asc we agreed to use our best efforts to register and maintain registration of the common shares underlying certain warrants the warrant shares that were issued by us with debt instruments  so that the warrant holder may freely sell the warrant shares if the warrant is exercised  and we agreed that in any event we would secure effective registration within a certain time period after issuance typically up to five months from issuance 
in addition  while the relevant warrant agreement does not require cash settlement if we do not maintain continuous registration of certain warrant shares  the agreement does not specifically preclude cash settlement 
as a result asc requires us to assume that in the absence of continuous effective registration we may be required to settle some of these warrants for cash when they are exercised 
accordingly  our agreement to register and maintain registration of certain warrant shares without express terms for settlement in the absence of continuous effective registration is presumed to create a liability to settle these warrants in cash  requiring liability classification 
we have issued other warrants under another agreement that expressly provides that if we fail to satisfy registration requirements we will be obligated only to issue additional common stock as the holder s sole remedy  with no possibility of settlement in cash 
in this circumstance  we account for those warrants as equity because additional shares are the only form of settlement available to the holder 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the valuation model to estimate the fair value of all warrants 
we evaluate the balance sheet classification of the warrants during each reporting period 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of the warrant is determined by the amount of time remaining on the original six year term of the relevant warrant agreement 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting period 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrants classified as a liability from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of other income expense 
the warrants that are accounted for as equity are only valued on the issuance date and not subsequently revalued 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until  and if  an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically questioned regarding the amount of taxes due 
these questions may relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions  if necessary 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if we prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
we provide estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  expiring and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if we determine that our inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and we would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
our policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life  is not amortized  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios  including the use of experts 
definite lived intangible assets 
we also have other intangible assets mainly consisting of patents and licenses  developed technologies and customer relationships  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of december  we capitalize the cost of acquiring patents and licenses 
we acquired certain customer relationships and developed technologies in the acquisition of our staar japan subsidiary which was completed on december  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  since the pattern in which the economic benefits realized cannot be reasonably determined  which are based on legal  contractual and other provisions  and range from to years for patents and licenses  years for customer relationships and to years for developed technology 
we review intangible assets for impairment in the assessment discussed above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
employee defined benefit plans 
we have maintained a passive pension plan the swiss plan covering employees of its swiss subsidiary 
the company concluded that the features of the swiss plan conform to the features of a defined benefit plan 
as a result  we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of accounting standards codification transition guidance  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in staar japan  inc  we assumed the net pension liability under staar japan s noncontributory defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all of the employees of staar japan 
staar japan adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of accounting standards codification for defined benefit plans pension on december   the date of the acquisition 
defined benefits plans pension requires recognition of the funded status  or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets  then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability 
we record a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of both plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  and the expected long term rate of asset return based on the market related value of assets 
the fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements pertaining to our employee defined benefit plans could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years had adversely affected our ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which could significantly affect our operating results 
we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency or fluctuations in foreign currencies 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the past three years
