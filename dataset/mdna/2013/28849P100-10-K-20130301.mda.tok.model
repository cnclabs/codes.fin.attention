overview we provide business automation software for a large segment of the mortgage industry in the united states 
our on demand  technology enabled software solutions help streamline and automate the process of originating and funding new mortgage loans  increasing efficiency  facilitating regulatory compliance and reducing documentation errors 
mortgage originators use our encompass software  a comprehensive operating system that handles key business and management functions  in running a mortgage origination business 
mortgage originators use encompass as a single tool for loan processing  marketing and customer communication  as well as to interact electronically with mortgage lenders  investors and service providers over the ellie mae network 
it also enables enforcement of rules and business practices designed to ensure loan quality  adherence to processing standards and regulatory compliance 
we also offer encompass users a variety of other on demand software services  including encompass docs solution  which automatically prepares the disclosure and closing documents necessary to fund a mortgage  centerwise  a bundled offering of edm and websites used for customer relationship management  tql  which offers a suite of fraud detection  valuation  validation and risk analysis services tailored to individual aggregator investor requirements  encompass compliance service  which automatically checks for regulatory compliance throughout the origination process  tax transcript services which provide income verification capability to our customers  and encompass product and pricing service  which allows encompass users to compare loans offered by different lenders and investors to determine the best product and price available to a particular borrower 
by the nature of our on demand service  even with our robust security monitoring and detection systems  we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches and we may need to expend significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences 
the ellie mae network electronically connects the approximately  mortgage professionals using our encompass software to a broad array of investors  mega lenders and third party service providers integral to the origination and funding of residential mortgages 
during the mortgage origination process  mortgage originators may order various services through the ellie mae network  including credit reports  product eligibility and pricing  automated underwriting  secure data transmission to and from lenders and investors  appraisals  title reports  insurance  flood certifications  compliance review  fraud detection  document preparation and verification of income  identity and employment 
we were formed as a california corporation in and reincorporated in delaware in november from inception through  we developed consumer facing websites and initial versions of our network 
we launched our first transaction platform in late  the present version of which is the ellie mae network 
our revenues consist of on demand and on premise revenues 
on demand revenues are generated primarily from software subscriptions we host that customers access through the internet and pay fees based on the number of loans they fund  or success basis  subject to monthly base fees  which we refer to as success based pricing 
on demand revenues also include software services that are sold transactionally as well as ellie mae network transaction fees paid by lender investors  service providers and certain 
table of contents government sponsored entities participating on the ellie mae network 
on premise revenues are typically generated from customer hosted software licenses and related implementations  training and maintenance services 
for further discussion of the sources of our revenue and our revenue recognition policy  please see our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
our on demand revenues generally track the seasonality of the mortgage industry  typically  but not always  with increased activity in the second and third quarters and reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as home buyers tend to purchase their homes during the spring and summer in order to move to a new home before the start of the school year 
given the recent turmoil in the mortgage industry along with ongoing low interest rates  mortgage activity has been less affected by seasonality 
approximately of our revenue historically has been sensitive to factors that impact mortgage volumes  such as interest rate fluctuations  home sale activity and general economic conditions 
the mortgage industry has undergone significant changes since  largely in response to the hundreds of billions of dollars of loan defaults and massive losses suffered by lenders and investors 
our business strategy has evolved to address recent industry trends  including expected lower lending volume  increased quality standards imposed by regulators  lenders and investors  increased regulation affecting lenders and investors  greater focus on operational efficiencies  and customers adopting multi channel strategies we are responding to these trends as follows expected lower lending volume 
mortgage lending volumes are expected to be lower in as compared to  as forecasted by fannie mae  freddie mac and the mortgage bankers association 
since late  we have focused our marketing and sales efforts on our on demand saas encompass offering  and particularly our saas encompass success based pricing model  in contrast to our on premise license model 
in our on demand saas encompass offering  the customer does not pay the significant up front licensing fee associated with our license model  which we believe is particularly attractive in the present climate of the residential mortgage origination market 
our saas encompass success based pricing model builds on this value proposition by aligning customers payments for our software solutions with their own receipts of revenues 
our focus on our saas encompass offering is important in light of lower lending volumes because we typically generate greater revenues per user through our on demand saas encompass offering than through our on premise license offering 
we are also focusing on increasing use of our ellie mae network offerings and our other services  which were introduced from late through late these offerings include our tql initiative  encompass compliance services  encompass product and pricing services and encompass docs solution 
at december  and our encompass users employed the ellie mae network to process on average approximately six and five transactions per loan file  respectively 
by continuing to enhance our service offerings and encouraging providers of settlement services to deliver their services electronically through the ellie mae network  we will continue to build value for ellie mae network participants while increasing the number of transactions for which the ellie mae network is used 
increased quality standards imposed by regulators  lenders and investors 
encompass software is designed to automate and streamline the process of originating mortgages to  among other things  satisfy increased quality requirements of investors 
relevant features of encompass software include enabling customers management to impose processing rules and formats  and providing milestone and process reminders  automated population of forms with accurate data  and accurate and automated transmission of loan files and data from originators to investors and lenders 
our tql initiative is designed to further enhance the quality  compliance and saleability of loans that are originated through our encompass software and at december   we had two tql investor customers 
tql is intended to reduce the opportunities for errors in the process of transferring information from originator to investor and give investors confidence in the accuracy and regulatory compliance of the information that is underlying loan files 
in response to the increased quality standards and compliance mandates affecting the industry  we expect an increased number of mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and replace their legacy systems 
we have increased the size of our customer acquisition  implementation and support teams by approximately from december  to december  in order to take advantage of the anticipated demand for our software solutions 
increased regulation affecting lenders and investors 
regulatory reforms have significantly increased the complexity and importance of regulatory compliance 
we devote considerable resources to continually upgrading software to help customers address regulatory changes 
we offer encompass compliance service  which automatically checks loan files for compliance with the myriad of federal  state and local regulations and alerts users to possible violations of these regulations 
in addition  we have 
table of contents a staff of attorneys and work with compliance experts who help assure that documents prepared using our software and the processes recommended by the encompass work flow comply with applicable rules and regulations 
greater focus on operational efficiencies 
mortgage originators experienced an approximately increase in operational costs between and as a result of increased regulation and investor demands for loan quality  and these trends are expected to continue 
by automating many of the functions of mortgage origination  we enable our users to comply with regulations and process quality loans more efficiently and effectively 
this reduces the cost of originating a loan and lowers the risk of buy back demands from investors resulting from poorly originated or documented loans and or loans that fail to comply with applicable regulations 
with an eye towards providing customers with ever greater tools to enhance efficiency  we will continue to develop new service offerings through the ellie mae network and pursue adoption of our services through initiatives such as our tql initiative 
by integrating and expanding our current and new services  we will provide a more comprehensive benefit to our users 
in addition to providing efficiency enhancing solutions  delivery of our encompass software in an on demand saas environment provides customers with the added benefits of lower up front implementation costs and reduced need for an infrastructure of servers  storage and network devices as well as providing access to the most current release of an application  periodic upgrades and regulatory updates 
customers adopting multi channel strategies 
customers are developing multi channel strategies beyond a single retail  correspondent or wholesale channel in order to grow their businesses 
the requirements of these different channels vary and in order to maintain a single operating system  customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality 
we continually address the changing needs of our customers by developing and enhancing tools to allow for simplified regulatory compliance  increased availability of information  and enhanced system functionality and performance 
acquisition strategy we acquired two software companies in and as our initial entry into the business of providing loan processing software and document preparation services for mortgage originators 
we introduced our internally developed encompass software solution in we acquired software and related assets from online documents  inc  or odi  to enhance our document preparation services in september  commenced our compliance services offering in december through our acquisition of mavent and added our encompass product and pricing service to our encompass software in january through our acquisition of assets from mps 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of dmd  a mortgage lending automation business  to increase our customer base and our product offerings by providing additional proprietary back end mortgage lending software and to broaden the functionality of our encompass solutions 
we believe there are strategic opportunities available to acquire competing software companies or software providers that offer related mortgage origination functionality that will complement and increase the attractiveness of our encompass software offerings and intend to continue pursuing additional strategic acquisitions 
operating metrics revenue per average active encompass user and saas encompass revenue per average active saas encompass user are key operational metrics we use to evaluate our business  determine allocation of our resources and make decisions regarding corporate strategy 
the revenue per average active encompass user metric is calculated by dividing total revenues by average active encompass users during the period 
the saas encompass revenue per average active saas encompass user metric is calculated by dividing total saas encompass revenues by average active saas encompass users during the period 
we focus on these metrics to determine our success in leveraging our user base to increase our revenues 
we track active encompass users and active saas encompass users as well as related revenues generated by each group at the end of a period to gauge the degree of our market penetration 
the components used to calculate these metrics are defined below 
active encompass users 
an active encompass user is a mortgage origination professional who has used encompass software at least once within a day period preceding the measurement date 
an encompass user is a mortgage origination professional working at a mortgage lender  such as a mortgage bank  commercial bank  thrift or credit union  which sources and funds loans and generally sells these funded loans to investors  or a mortgage brokerage  who typically processes and submits loan files to a mortgage lender or mega lender that funds the loan

all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from transaction based fees and fees for software and related services 
we re categorized our revenues beginning with the first quarter of to better align with our strategic plan 
accordingly  our revenues are now described as on demand and on premise revenues 
sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from revenue 
on demand revenues on demand revenues are revenues generated from company hosted software subscriptions that customers access through the internet as well as revenues from a small number of customers that have opted to self host a portion of the software but pay fees based on a per closed loan  or success  basis subject to monthly base fees  which we refer to as success based pricing 
on demand revenues are also comprised of software services sold transactionally and ellie mae network transaction fees 
on premise revenues on premise revenues generally are revenues generated from customer hosted software licenses and related implementation except for customer hosted success based pricing revenues included in on demand revenues described above  training and maintenance services 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
table of contents our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and benefits  including stock based compensation  expenses for document preparation  income verification and compliance services  customer support  data centers  depreciation on computer equipment used in supporting the ellie mae network  saas encompass and centerwise offerings  amortization of acquired intangible assets such as developed technology and trade names  professional services associated with implementation of our software  and allocated facilities costs 
we expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as our revenues increase  as we make additional investments in our technology infrastructure and as we continue to hire additional personnel in our implementation and customer support departments to support new customers 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation  including stock based compensation and commissions  allocated facilities costs  expenses for trade shows  public relations and other promotional and marketing activities  expenses for travel and entertainment  and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer lists and contracts 
we expect that our sales and marketing expense will continue to increase as we continue to hire additional sales personnel in order to take advantage of the anticipated demand for our software solutions as we expect an increased number of mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and replace their legacy systems 
we also intend to increase marketing activities focused on our saas encompass software  our ellie mae network offerings and our other encompass services 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  including bonuses and stock based compensation  fees to contractors engaged in the development and support of the ellie mae network infrastructure  encompass software and other products  and allocated facilities costs 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our products and services and infrastructure  including hiring additional engineering and product development personnel 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  including bonuses and stock based compensation  for employees involved in finance  accounting  human resources  administrative and legal roles  consulting  legal  accounting and other professional services by third party providers  and allocated facilities costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars primarily due to greater amounts of stock compensation expense relating to awards granted to attract and retain the employees needed to continue to grow our business 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments  cash accounts and notes receivable  offset by investment discount amortization and imputed interest expense related to the dmd acquisition holdback payments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and interest expense paid on equipment and software leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  fair value of investments and software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from on demand and on premise fees for software and related services 
we re categorized our revenues beginning with the first quarter of to on demand revenues and on premise revenues to better align with our strategic plan 

table of contents on demand revenues subscription services and usage based fee arrangements 
subscription services and usage based fee arrangements generally include a combination of our products delivered as software as a service  or saas  product updates and support services 
these revenues generally include the following saas encompass revenues 
we offer web based access to our encompass software for a monthly recurring fee 
we provide the right to access our loan origination software and handle the responsibility of managing the servers  providing security  backing up the data and applying updates  however  except where customers self host a portion of the software in a success based pricing structure  customers under saas arrangements may not take possession of the software at any time during the term of the agreement 
associated set up fees are recognized ratably over the life of the relationship with customers  which is generally the life of the contract 
contracts generally range from one to three years 
alternatively  customers can elect to pay on a per closed loan  or success  basis 
success basis contracts generally have a term of two to three years and are subject to monthly base fees  which enable customers to close loans up to a contractually agreed to minimum number of transactions  and additional closed loan fees  which are assessed for loans closed in excess of the minimum 
revenue is earned from both base fees and additional closed loan fees as the result of the customer usage of encompass software 
monthly base fees are recognized over the respective monthly service period as the software is utilized 
additional closed loans fees are recognized when the loans are reported as closed 
this offering also includes centerwise for encompass as an integrated component  which is a combined element of the arrangement that is delivered in conjunction with the saas encompass offering and therefore is not accounted for separately 
in general  upfront non refundable fees received at the inception of an arrangement are deferred and recognized over the longer of the contractual term or the estimated customer relationship period 
centerwise for encompass licensees 
centerwise is a bundled offering of edm and websites used for customer relationship management 
generally  revenue is recognized for centerwise as the service is performed  except when centerwise is automatically included as an integrated component of the saas encompass offering  in which case the associated revenue is recognized as described above 
services revenues 
we provide mortgage related and other business services  including automated documentation preparation and compliance reports 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
transaction revenues 
we have entered into agreements with various lenders  service providers and certain government agencies participating in the mortgage origination process that provide them access to  and ability to interoperate with  mortgage originators on the ellie mae network 
under these agreements  we have the opportunity to earn transaction fees when transactions are processed through the ellie mae network 
transaction revenues are recognized when there is evidence that the qualifying transactions have occurred on the ellie mae network and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
associated set up fees are recognized ratably  beginning upon completion of the integration and continuing over the remaining estimated life of the relationship with its customer  which generally is the remaining life of the contract 
on premise revenues with the exception of revenue from customers that self host a portion of the software in a success based pricing structure  which is recognized as described above  revenue from the sale of software licenses is recognized in the month in which the required revenue recognition criteria are met  generally in the month in which the software is delivered 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is evidenced by a signed agreement  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements for software arrangements with multiple elements eg  undelivered maintenance and support contracts bundled with licenses  revenue is allocated to the delivered elements of the arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  is determinable  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
when vsoe is not determinable  the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue is recognized under this model upon receipt of cash payment from the customer if collectability is not reasonably assured and when other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support obligations related to licenses is based upon the prices paid for the separate renewal of these services by the customer 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contract 
revenues for usage based fee arrangements are recognized when the services are delivered to the customer 
when subscription services involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting  we allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes i vsoe if available  ii third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  and iii the best estimate of selling price  or besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 

table of contents vsoe 
we determine vsoe based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have not historically priced our subscription services within a narrow range 
as a result  we have not been able to establish selling prices for subscription services based on vsoe 
tpe 
when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements  we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services selling prices are on a standalone basis 
as a result  we have not been able to establish selling prices based on tpe 
besp 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service was sold on a standalone basis 
when establishing besp  we review company specific factors used to determine list price and make adjustments as appropriate to reflect current market conditions and pricing behavior 
our process for establishing list price includes assessing the cost to provide a particular product or service  surveying customers to determine market expectations  analyzing customer demographics and taking into account similar products and services historically sold by us 
we continue to review the factors used to establish list price and adjust besp as necessary 
because we have determined that neither vsoe nor tpe are available  we use besp to allocate the selling price to subscription services and usage based fee deliverables 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we provide for tax positions whenever it is deemed likely that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws 
a tax position is only recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock option grants that are ultimately expected to vest based on estimated fair values on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
such expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period 
as of december   estimated future compensation costs related to unvested stock options are million in  million in  million in  and million in we recognize compensation expense related to restricted awards  restricted stock unit awards  or rsus  and performance share awards  or performance awards  based on the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant 
expense related to the restricted awards and the rsus are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period 
expense related to the performance awards is recognized under 
table of contents an accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which recognizes a larger portion of the expense during the beginning of the vesting period than in the end of the vesting period 
we estimate the probable number of shares of common stock that will be granted until the achievement of the performance goals is known 
as of december   estimated future compensation costs related to unvested rsus and performance awards are million in  million in  million in  and million in we are required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust recorded compensation cost accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is based on historical experience and is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from the prior estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will impact the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in future periods  which could be material if actual results differ significantly from our estimates 
all stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the measurement of stock based compensation for non employees is subject to periodic adjustments as the options vest  and the expense is recognized over the period services are rendered 
the following table summarizes the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model relating to stock options in the years ended december   and year ended december  stock option plans risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield volatility employee stock purchase plan risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield volatility employee stock purchase plan established in goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization  as appropriate 
other intangible assets include developed technology  trade names and customer lists and contracts 
intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated periods of benefit  generally one to nine years 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
these tests are performed at the reporting unit level  which is the company as a whole  using a two step  fair value approach 
we completed annual impairment tests for the years ended december   and and determined that our goodwill was not impaired for those years 
if management estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values of any such reporting units and the estimated fair value of goodwill could change significantly  and could result in an impairment charge 
such changes could also result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition therein 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors 
if management estimates 
table of contents of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
fair value of investments all of our investments that have a maturity of greater than days are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
we invest excess cash primarily in investment grade interest bearing securities such as money market accounts  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal and government agency obligations and guaranteed obligations of the us government  all of which are subject to minimal credit and market risks 
fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable  such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
the cost of available for sale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  are reported in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses are included in interest income and other expense  respectively 
interest and dividends are included in interest income when they are earned 
as of december   our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included million of money market funds and million of marketable debt instruments 
of these marketable debt instruments  million was classified as level and million as level all of our money market funds are classified as level when determining fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact  and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
for further information  see fair value of financial instruments in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value 
when fair value is determined using pricing models  such as a discounted cash flow model  the issuer credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value  as appropriate 
our money market funds and marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets 
management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active 
our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period 
when we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets  we classify our marketable financial instruments as level when observable market prices for identical securities are not available  we price our marketable financial instruments using non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data  quoted market prices for similar instruments  or pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 
non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers 
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs  including non binding and binding broker quotes  observable market prices for identical or similar securities  and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and  to a lesser degree  unobservable market inputs 
we corroborate non binding market consensus prices with observable market data as such data exists 
we had no investments classified as level at december  software and website development costs we capitalize costs related to internal use software and website application development 
in each case the software or website application is for internal needs and we do not plan to market the software externally 
costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
our management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
the capitalized costs are included in the property and equipment  net line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for the year ended december   we capitalized software and website application development costs of million 
there were no such costs capitalized in the years ended december  and there was no amortization recorded in the years ended december   and  respectively

the number of active saas encompass users increased by to  users at december  from  users at december  due to the addition of new customers as well as the transition of on premise licensed users to our saas encompass success based pricing offering 
saas encompass revenue per average active saas user increased by for the year ended december  compared to same period of due to an increase in the number of closed loans per active saas user as well as the continued movement of users to our success based pricing model  which offers higher revenue per user compared to our traditional license model
