overview since  broadvision has been a pioneer and consistent innovator of e business solutions 
we deliver a combination of technologies and services into the global market that enable customers of all sizes to power mission critical web initiatives that ultimately deliver high value to their bottom line 
our offering consists of a robust framework for personalization and self service  modular applications and agile toolsets that customers use to create e commerce  portal solutions  and enterprise social networks 
as of december   we had licensed our products to approximately companies 
our objective is to further our position as a global supplier of enterprise social networking solutions through our new clearvale products and to sustain our legacy business agility suite  commerce agility suite and quicksilver solutions 
this will require us to continue to build new functionality into our solutions that offer our customers a compelling value proposition to subscribe or license our solutions rather than design and build custom solutions 
we generate revenue from fees for licenses of our software products and related maintenance  consulting services and customer training 
we generally charge fees for licenses of our software products based on the number of persons registered to use the product  the number of cpus utilized by the machines on which the product is installed  or usage of cloud or saas software as a service  a software model in which vendors host software that customers access remotely 
payment terms are generally days from the date the software products are delivered  the maintenance or subscription contracts are booked  or the consulting services are provided 
we generated net income in years  and  and net loss in years   and our ability to generate profits or positive cash flows in future periods remains uncertain 
our operations in faced three challenges continuing world wide recession  maturity of our major revenue generating legacy products  and ramping up of our new clearvale enterprise social network products 
we continued to invest heavily in clearvale  while also servicing our legacy base 
clearvale revenue grew from to  but the increase was not enough to offset the continuing decline in legacy revenue  due to the currently small customer base of clearvale 
in mid  we moved to our new headquarters  as our old office lease expired 
the move resulted in the elimination of our excess real estate space that began when we reduced our workforce in and we no longer have any excess real estate worldwide 
we strive to anticipate changes in the demand for our services  and manage our costs appropriately 
as part of our budgeting process  cross functional management participates in the planning  reviewing and managing of our business plans 
this process is intended to allow us to adjust our cost structures to changing market needs  competitive landscapes and economic factors

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates this management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivable reserves  stock based compensation  investments  income taxes and restructuring  as well as contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview our revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products  maintenance  consulting services and training 
our revenue recognition policies comply with accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards in accounting standards update asu an update to asc asu for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using best estimated selling price besp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vsoe of selling price or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we adopted asu at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal the application of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact on total net revenues for fiscal year we recognize revenue when all four of the following revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we qualify the second of the above listed criteria differently for different types of revenues  as follows 
software license revenue  non subscription and non hosted products delivery of non subscription and non hosted software products is considered to have occurred when title to the physical media and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
in case of electronic delivery  delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
for products that cannot be used without a licensing key  the delivery requirement is met when the licensing key is made available to the customer 
we do not grant a right of return for non subscription or non hosted software products 
we recognize revenue upon the delivery of our software 
software license revenue  subscription products or hosted products although we make our software available to the customer at a particular point in time  the delivery of subscription software products such as quicksilver and hosted software products such as clearvale and clear is considered to have occurred ratably over the duration of the contract 
we recognize revenue ratably 
services revenues consulting services revenues and training revenues are recognized as such services are performed 
these services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
we record reimbursement from our customers for out of pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues 
maintenance revenue  which includes revenue that is derived from software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to our products  is recognized ratably over the related agreement period  which time period is generally twelve months 
receivable reserves occasionally  our customers experience financial difficulty after we record the sale but before payment has been received 
we maintain receivable reserves for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our normal payment terms are generally to days from the invoice date 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make the contractual payments  additional reserves may be required 
losses from customer receivables in the two year period ended december   have not been significant 
if all efforts to collect a receivable fail  and the receivable is considered uncollectible  we would write off against the receivable reserve 
research and development and software development costs asc  costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed asc  requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model 
to date  costs incurred by us between the completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant 
accordingly  we have charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred 
income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  is not expected to be realized 
we analyze our deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization 
we have established a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent that management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization 
we consider the effects of estimated future taxable income  current economic conditions and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted asc  compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
under asc  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated pre vesting forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
we adopted the alternative transition method provided in asc for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to asc in the fourth quarter of fiscal the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of asc the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
further details related to our stock benefit plans and our adoption of asc are provided in note stockholders equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring through june   we approved restructuring plans to  among other things  reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities 
restructuring and asset impairment charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization 
our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of i lease termination costs and or costs associated with permanently vacating our facilities  and ii other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan 
we account for each of these costs in accordance with asc  exit or disposal of cost obligations asc 
excess facilities costs 
we account for excess facilities costs as follows for exit or disposal activities  we account for lease termination and or abandonment costs in accordance with asc  which requires that a liability for such costs be recognized and measured initially at fair value on the cease use date of the facility 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings to date  the majority of estimates made by management have related to charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charges for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates have related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce our lease obligations 
we based our estimates of sublease income  in part  current market conditions and rental rates  an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
we have recorded the low end of a range of assumptions modeled for restructuring charges 
adjustments to the facilities accrual will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations in current operations based on management most current estimates 
further details related to our restructuring charges and activities are provided in note restructuring in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources background and overview at december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately million 
our management believes that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  will be sufficient to fund operations through at least december  if our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are not sufficient to meet our obligations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms as needed  we may be unable to pay our debts as they become due  develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
as of december   we had million of cash and million of short term investments  with no long term debt borrowings 
the combined cash and short term investment balances at december  declined by million compared to december  levels 
this decrease was mainly due to net cash used for operating activities and cash provided from financing activities  as described in the consolidated statement of cash flow and the reclassification from restricted cash to cash during year revenues in year of million were down from revenues of million 
the decrease was due to product transitioning 
we are investing heavily in our new product  clearvale  while our older products mature 
it will take time for the new product revenue to ramp up 
we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from clearvale  but if we are able to do so  it will take time for such new product revenue to ramp up 
we anticipate that net cash used for operating activities will continue to be the material use of our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
