store technology 
our store based information systems are comprised of a proprietary and integrated point of sale  electronic parts catalog  or epc  and store level inventory management system collectively store system 
information maintained by our store system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our fully integrated system enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our store system provides real time inventory tracking at the store level allowing store team members to check the quantity of on hand inventory for any sku  adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events  automatically process returns and defective merchandise  designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the store system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our hub or pdq networks or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  hub  pdq or directly from the vendor with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated  accurate parts information

store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations store support center in roanoke  virginia  regional office in minneapolis  minnesota  and global sourcing office in taipei  taiwan 
our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories  oil and chemicals 
our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 
in fiscal  we purchased merchandise from approximately vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory productivity 

table of contents our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will generate diy customer traffic and also appeal to our commercial customers 
some of these brands include bosch  castrol  dayco  federal mogul moog  or moog  monroe  prestone  purolator  trico and wagner 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value conscious customers

our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse  hub and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs 
our replenishment system utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand 
our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
the vast majority of our purchase orders are sent to our merchandise vendors via electronic data interchange 
during we opened our remington  in distribution center 
this distribution center will provide needed capacity to support our growth and product availability initiatives 
it incorporates our new warehouse management system  or wms  and state of the art order processing technology which  in addition to the features below  will allow us to provide daily replenishment to many of the stores served by remington 
including the remington facility  we operate nine aap distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with a wms which provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers 
the wms  integrated with material handling equipment  reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems

table of contents ai segment ai business primarily serves the commercial market  with an emphasis on parts for imported cars  from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeastern  mid atlantic and southeastern regions of the united states 
in addition  its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing premium parts  expert customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai product is sold under its own proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer approximately  skus through routine replenishment from its supply chain with access to an additional  to  skus through local sourcing networks 
ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september at december   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states location number of stores location number of stores location number of stores alabama maryland ohio connecticut massachusetts pennsylvania delaware north carolina rhode island dc new hampshire south carolina florida new jersey vermont georgia new york virginia maine the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed approximately  full time team members and approximately  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption 
we believe that our team member relations are good 
intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  autopart international  driverside  motologic and service is our best part  for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 

table of contents competition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc 
and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators  v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internet based parts providers 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include customer service  product offerings  availability  quality  price and store location 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing collection  transportation and recycling of automotive lead acid batteries  used automotive oil and other recyclable items  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring automotive lead acid batteries  used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead acid batteries  used oil and other recyclable items at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries  used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
our third party vendors who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries  used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date 
item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks  both known and unknown 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors 
these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons  including the number and average age of vehicles being driven  because the majority of vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under the manufacturers warranties and tend to need maintenance and repair 
if the number and average age of vehicles being driven were to decrease it would negatively impact demand for our products 

table of contents the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  conversely  during periods of favorable economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  the weather  because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven  because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturer dealer network using dealer parts  and lower vehicle mileage  which may be affected by gas prices and other factors  decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts  our vendors  because if any of our key vendors do not supply us with products on terms that are favorable to us or fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected  our reputation and our brands  because our reputation is critical to our continued success 
if we fail to maintain high standards for  or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to  product safety  quality or integrity  it could reduce demand for our products 
the product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands 
if the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic  repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers  our revenues may decline  and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including name recognition  location  price  quality  product availability and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators  v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internet based parts providers 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  store locations  store layouts  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases  more favorable vendor relationships  lower prices  and better product warranties 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending  which would lower our revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines  require us to discontinue current product offerings  or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources  expertise  consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we may lose customers  our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively  or if these initiatives are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

table of contents successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition to the aforementioned risk factors  adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending  our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share  and our ability to continue our commercial sales growth 
for that portion of our inventory manufactured and or sourced outside the united states  geopolitical changes  changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  shipping related issues  natural disasters  pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings  the successful integration of any acquired businesses or the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new store openings we have increased our store count significantly in the last ten years from  stores at the end of fiscal to  stores at december  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions 
we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful 
as we open more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things the availability of desirable store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources  including access to capital at cost effective interest rates  and our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates 
we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis  or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 
acquisition integration on december   we acquired bwp distributors  inc strategic acquisitions have been and may continue to be an element of our growth strategy in the future 
acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations  examples of such risks include the following we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms  our management attention may be distracted  we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses  we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses we acquire to realize economic  operational and other benefits  and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we  as a successor owner or operator  may be liable 

table of contents supply chain our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and hub stores 
as we service our growing store base  we will need to increase the capacity of our supply chain network in order to provide the added parts availability under our superior availability strategy while maintaining productivity and profitability expectations 
we cannot be assured of the availability of potential locations on lease or purchase terms that would be acceptable to us  of our ability to integrate those new locations into our existing supply chain network or of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels 
we are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards 
if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality  we could experience lost sales  increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk 
all of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws  and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 
to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design and or manufacturing processes  the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise 
in addition  negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs  resulting in lost sales 
in those circumstances  it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members  whom we may not be able to attract and retain 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members 
at february   we employed approximately  team members 
we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 
the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions 
downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
if similar litigation were instituted against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management attention and resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
deterioration in global credit markets and changes in our credit ratings and deterioration in general macro economic conditions  including unemployment  inflation or deflation  consumer debt levels  high fuel and energy costs  and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions impacts us through i potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets ii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers and iii an increase in operating costs from higher energy prices 
impact of credit market uncertainty and changes in credit ratings significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in and resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms 
we can provide no assurance that the credit market events during and will not occur again in the foreseeable future 
conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and long term borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt 
it is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 

table of contents our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control 
the interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings 
accordingly  any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements 
in addition  it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program  where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions  which could result in increased working capital requirements 
an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact on our suppliers our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms 
one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions 
these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short term or long term and meet our product requirements 
financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them 
we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers  and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices 
we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies  work stoppages  labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 
impact on our customers deterioration in macro economic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth  financial resources and disposable income 
while macro economic conditions have improved since and  unemployment rates have remained at historically high levels  consumer confidence continues to fluctuate at lower levels and payroll taxes have recently increased for most us workers as a result of the changes in tax legislation effective for this impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories  maintenance or repair of their vehicles  which results in lower sales in our stores 
higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed

in the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident  we could experience certain operational problems or interruptions  incur substantial additional costs  or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings  any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace 
the nature of our business requires us to receive  retain and transmit certain personally identifying information that our customers provide to purchase products or services  register on our websites  or otherwise communicate and interact with us 
while we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information and the functioning of our computer systems  website and other online offerings  a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or other operational problems or interruptions 
we develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring  but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change  privacy and information security regulations change  and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 
consequently  despite our efforts  our security measures have been breached in the past and may be breached in the future due to cyber attack  team member error  malfeasance  fraudulent inducement or other acts  and unauthorized parties have in the past obtained  and may in the future  obtain access to our data or our customers data 
while costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant  any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 
while we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect confidential information  there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by third parties may be compromised 
if a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and  possibly  subject us to additional legal  regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace 
business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours  operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability

some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores 
terrorist attacks  war in the middle east  or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil  gasoline  diesel fuel and energy costs 
such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers  and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business  sales  profit margins and results of operations

we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  including litigation arising from claims of employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims by current and former team members

our western auto subsidiary  together with other defendants including automobile manufacturers  automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers  has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products 
we and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits 
the plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured  distributed and or sold by the various defendants 
these products have primarily included brake parts 
many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation 
the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial 
additionally  some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy  which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants 
although we diligently defend against these claims  we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits  and may enter into settlement agreements  if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
we also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance 
based on discovery to date  we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us 
however  if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance  these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
historically  our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in type and number and have been immaterial 
as a result  we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the company in the future 
if the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products increases substantially  the costs associated with concluding these claims  including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and cash flows in future periods

introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  accessories  batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states 
our stores carry an extensive product line for cars  vans  sport utility vehicles and light trucks 
we serve both diy and commercial customers 
our commercial customers consist primarily of delivery customers for whom we deliver product from our store locations to our commercial customers places of business  including independent garages  service stations and auto dealers 
at december   we operated  stores throughout states  puerto rico and the virgin islands 
we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts  or aap  and autopart international  or ai 
the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the northeastern  mid atlantic  southeastern and midwestern inclusive of south central regions of the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands 
these stores operate under the trade name advance auto parts except for certain stores in the state of florida  which operate under the advance discount auto parts trade name 
at december   we operated  stores in the aap segment 
our aap stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks 
through our integrated operating approach  we serve our diy and commercial customers from our store locations and online at www 
advanceautoparts 
com 
our online website allows our diy customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to their home or business 
our commercial customers can conveniently place their orders online 
at december   we operated stores in the ai segment under the autopart international trade name 
ai business serves the commercial market from its store locations primarily in the northeastern  mid atlantic and southeastern regions of the united states 
management overview we generated earnings per diluted share  or diluted eps  of during fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in our diluted eps was driven by a lower average share count during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in operating income 
throughout most of fiscal  our sales remained constrained  particularly in our colder weather markets  driven by the unseasonably warmer temperatures which has decreased the demand for failure and maintenance parts 
the uncertainty in the us economy also impacted our sales consistent with many other retailers  including our peer companies in the automotive aftermarket industry  as consumers faced high unemployment  fluctuating gas prices and low consumer confidence 
in response to the difficult sales environment  we focused on providing better service to our commercial customers and improving weekend staffing to better serve our diy customers 
despite our lower performance in fiscal  we remain encouraged by i the long term dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry  ii initiatives that are underway in support of our strategies and iii our growth potential in the more fragmented and faster growing commercial market 
while our operating income in fiscal declined from the comparable period of last year  we generated a significant amount of operating cash flow to enable us to invest in capital projects and initiatives to support our strategies 
as discussed later in the business and industry update  we remain committed to investing in our two key strategies superior availability and service leadership 

table of contents fiscal highlights a high level summary of our financial results and other highlights from our fiscal include financial total sales during fiscal increased to  million as compared to fiscal  primarily driven by the addition of net new stores partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
our operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of total sales  operating income was  a decrease of basis points  due to the deleverage of our sg a rate partially offset by a slightly higher gross profit rate 
our inventory balance as of december  increased million  or  over the prior year driven primarily by our inventory availability initiatives  including store upgrades  the opening of our new distribution center  continued expansion of our hub network and new store growth 
we generated operating cash flow of million during fiscal  a decrease of compared to fiscal  with the largest portion of the decrease consisting of an increase in accounts receivable resulting from the in sourcing of our commercial credit program 
other in january we issued million of senior unsecured notes  due in  with an interest rate of 
we opened our tenth distribution center in remington  in which will provide needed warehouse capacity and upgraded supply chain technology 
we in sourced our commercial credit function and rolled out our motologic diagnostic and repair resource to support the continued investment in our commercial business 
subsequent to fiscal  we completed the acquisition of bwp distributors  inc  a leading commercial provider in the northeast 
refer to the results of operations and liquidity sections for further details of our income statement and cash flow results  respectively 
business update our two key strategies  superior availability and service leadership  remained unchanged in fiscal and continue to serve as the foundation for all of the initiatives we undertake 
superior availability is focused on consistently improving product availability and maximizing the speed  reliability and efficiency of our local market availability 
service leadership relies on superior availability and a more consistent execution of serving our diy and commercial customers needs whether in our stores or online 
through these two key strategies  we believe we can continue to build on the initiatives discussed below and produce favorable financial results over the long term 
sales to commercial customers remain the biggest opportunity for us to increase our overall market share in the automotive aftermarket industry 
our commercial sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
table of contents we believe our current initiatives are key for our long term sales growth and improvement in our gross profit rate 
combined with our focus on balancing support and discretionary expenses with the additional cost of investments in our key strategies  we are committed to achieving our longer term growth and profitability goals 
as we enter fiscal  the key initiatives under our strategies include growing our commercial business through improved delivery speed and reliability  increased customer retention and increased volume with national and regional accounts  improving localized parts availability through the continued increase in number of hubs  strengthened focus on key store availability and leveraging the advancement of our supply chain infrastructure  accelerating our new store growth rate  and continuing our focus on store execution through more effective scheduling  product on hand accuracy  sales training and customer engagement 
acquisition on december   we acquired bwp distributors  inc bwp  a privately held company that supplies  markets and distributes automotive aftermarket parts and products principally to commercial customers 
bwp operates or supplies locations in the northeastern united states 
we believe this acquisition will enable us to continue our expansion in the competitive northeast  which is a strategic growth area for us due to the large population and overall size of the market  and to gain valuable information to apply to our existing operations as a result of bwp expertise in commercial 
as a result of this transaction  we will operate bwp company owned stores and two distribution centers 
we will begin integrating the bwp locations in fiscal automotive aftermarket industry operating within the automotive aftermarket industry  we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors similar to those affecting the overall retail industry 
these factors include  but are not limited to  fuel costs  unemployment rates  consumer confidence and competition 
the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment continues to impact us and the retail industry in general 
while we believe that the current macroeconomic environment continues to constrain consumer spending  we remain confident that the long term dynamics of the automotive aftermarket industry are positive 
furthermore  we continue to believe we are well positioned to serve our customers by meeting their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 
we believe that two key drivers of demand within the automotive aftermarket are i the number of miles driven in the us and ii the number and average age of vehicles on the road 
miles driven we believe that the number of total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance of vehicles 
as the number of miles driven increases  consumers vehicles are more likely to need repair and maintenance  resulting in an increase in the need for automotive parts and maintenance items 
historically  the long term trend in miles driven in the us has steadily increased  however  according to the department of transportation  total miles driven in the us remained relatively flat from to as the us experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions 
historically  rapid increases in fuel prices have also negatively impacted total miles driven as consumers react to the increased expense by reducing travel 
average gasoline prices increased approximately during this same time frame 
while gas prices remain somewhat volatile and are not predicted to return to pre recessionary levels  gas prices were relatively flat when comparing the average price of gas in to and the number of miles driven in increased approximately as measured through october 
we believe that as the us economy continues to recover  and gasoline prices stabilize further  annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand in the automotive aftermarket industry 
number of registered vehicles and increase in average vehicle age we believe that the total number of vehicles excluding medium and heavy duty trucks on the road and the average age of vehicles on the road also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry 
there were million vehicles on the road in which is higher than in while recent industry data reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia indicates that the growth in number of vehicles on the road has decelerated and new vehicle registrations are increasing  the average age of vehicle continues to increase 
the average age of vehicles has gradually increased over the last five years from years in to years in we believe that the average age of vehicles continues to increase due to relatively constant scrappage rates  a rate of new car sales well under the year trend and an increase in overall quality of vehicles 
as the average age of a vehicle increases  a larger percentage of the 
table of contents miles driven are outside of the manufacturer warranty period 
these out of warranty  older vehicles generate a stronger demand for automotive aftermarket products due to routine maintenance cycles and more frequent mechanical failures 
we believe that consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy slowly recovers contributing to the trend of an aging vehicle population 
store development by segment the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and by segment

our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been open for complete accounting periods approximately one year and by including e commerce sales 
we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective merchandise and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix  ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  iii vendor programs  iv inventory shrinkage  v defective merchandise and warranty costs and vi warehouse and distribution costs 
we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume commitments  when we believe it is advantageous 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent and depreciation  advertising expenses  commercial delivery expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  share based compensation expense  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses  self insurance costs  closed store expense  impairment charges  if any  and other related expenses

table of contents quarterly consolidated financial results in thousands  except per share data weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended net sales gross profit net income net income per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits  the purchase of inventory  contractual obligations  capital expenditures and the payment of income taxes 
in addition  we have used available funds for acquisitions  to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offering as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to december  the end of fiscal 
this increase in cash was primarily a result of cash generated from operations and the issuance of senior unsecured notes partially offset by investments in property and equipment and net payments on our credit facilities 
additional discussion of our cash flow results  including the comparison of fiscal activity to fiscal  is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 
at december   our outstanding indebtedness was million  or million higher when compared to december   and consisted of borrowings of million under our senior unsecured notes and million outstanding on economic development notes 
additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility to million 
subsequent to year end  we used million of cash on hand to fund the purchase price and related expenses for our acquisition of bwp as discussed earlier in this management discussion and analysis and more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued new store openings  maintenance of existing stores  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  and the development of both proprietary and purchased information systems 
while we lease the vast majority of our store locations  we develop and own a small percentage of new store locations depending on market conditions 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open within a given year and the investments we make in our existing stores  information technology and our supply chain network 
in fiscal  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 
these investments will be primarily driven by new store development leased and owned locations  investments in our existing stores and investments under our superior availability and service leadership strategies  including continued investments in our supply chain network and new systems 
we anticipate opening to aap stores and to ai stores during fiscal excluding the bwp stores acquired on december  

table of contents stock repurchase program our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the sec 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share 
at december   we had million remaining under our million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on may  additionally  during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  in connection with the net settlement of shares issued as a result of the vesting of restricted stock 
dividend since fiscal  our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends of per share to stockholders of record 
on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on april  to all common stockholders of record as of march  commercial credit program during fiscal  we transitioned our commercial credit program from using a third party financial institution to settle credit transactions with our commercial customers to processing those transactions internally 
benefits we expect to realize include a higher level of service with our commercial customers and having a capability in place to increase the amount of commercial sales on credit while realizing cost savings over the long term 
our concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances  which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base 
we also mitigate our exposure to credit risk through a credit approval process including credit checks  pre determined credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures 
analysis of cash flows a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal  and is reflected in the table and following discussion 
fiscal year in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
this net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million decrease in cash flows from receivables primarily related to the transition of our in house commercial credit program  a million decrease in cash flows from inventory  net of accounts payable  due to a increase in inventory over the prior year driven by our inventory availability initiatives  including store upgrades to a greater coverage of parts  the opening of our new distribution center  continued expansion of our hub network and new store growth  coupled with a smaller increase in our accounts payable ratio versus the prior year  a million decrease in provision for deferred income taxes due to the lapse of certain corporate tax legislation  a million decrease in cash flow from other assets primarily related to timing of refundable income taxes and other working capital  a million decrease in cash flow from the excess tax benefit from share based compensation  and a million decrease in net income 

table of contents partially offsetting the decrease in operating cash flow was a million increase in cash flows provided by an increase in accrued expenses related to timing of the payment of certain expenses 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
this net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million increase in cash flows from inventory  net of accounts payable  as a result of the continued increase in our accounts payable ratio in fiscal combined with the deceleration of inventory growth during the second half of fiscal  an increase in net income of million  and a million increase in provision for deferred income taxes 
investing activities for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million 
the decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the decrease in cash used for business acquisitions 
for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million 
the increase in cash used was primarily driven by investments in our existing stores  supply chain and information technology as well as the acquisition of two small technology companies in support of our e commerce strategy 
the majority of the increase in our supply chain investments is related to the completion of our remington distribution center 
financing activities for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million 
this increase was primarily a result of a million decrease in cash used for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program  and million provided by the issuance of senior unsecured notes 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in net borrowings on credit facilities 
for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities increased by million to million 
cash used in financing activities increased as a result of a million decrease in financed vendor accounts payable  and a million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of share based compensation awards 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in net borrowings 
long term debt bank debt we have a million unsecured five year revolving credit facility with our wholly owned subsidiary  advance stores company  incorporated  or stores  serving as the borrower 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed million 
we may request  subject to agreement by one or more lenders  that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding million up to a total commitment of billion during the term of the revolving credit facility 
voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part  at our option  in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures on may  
table of contents as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for our self insurance policies 
the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based  at our option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the current margin is per annum for each of the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings 
a facility fee is charged on the total amount of the revolving credit facility  payable in arrears 
the current facility fee rate is per annum 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the interest rate and facility fee are based on our credit rating 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability to  among other things permit the subsidiaries of advance stores to create  incur or assume additional debt  incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments including acquisitions  guarantee obligations  engage in certain mergers and liquidations  change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries  enter into certain hedging transactions  and change our status as a holding company 
we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with our covenants in place at december  and december   respectively 
our revolving credit facility also provides for customary events of default  covenant defaults and cross defaults to other material indebtedness 
senior unsecured notes our senior unsecured notes were issued in april at of the principal amount of million and are due may  the notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
our senior unsecured notes were issued in january at of the principal amount of million and are due january  the notes or collectively with notes  the notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year 
we served as the issuer of the notes with certain of our domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors 
the terms of the notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures collectively the indenture among us  the subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time  at the redemption price described in the indenture 
in addition  in the event of a change of control triggering event as defined in each of the indentures for the notes  we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
the notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors 
we will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the notes under the circumstances described in the indenture i upon the release of the guarantee of our other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt  ii upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor  or iii upon our exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option 
as of december   we had a credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and from moody s investor service of baa the current outlooks by standard poor s and moody s are both stable 
the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings 
if these credit ratings decline  our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited 
in addition  it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment program  where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions  which could result in increased working capital requirements 
conversely  if these credit ratings improve  our interest rate may decrease 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item of the sec regulations 
we include other off balance sheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments  interest payments on our notes and revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 

table of contents contractual obligations in addition to our notes and revolving credit facility  we utilize operating leases as another source of financing 
the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations 
our future contractual obligations related to long term debt  operating leases and other contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt interest payments operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations note for additional information refer to note  long term debt  note  income taxes  note  lease commitments  note  contingencies  and note  benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item exhibits  financial statement schedules  of this annual report on form k 
long term debt primarily represents the principal amount of our notes and notes  which become due in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions 
these provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments which are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term 
any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations 
primarily includes the long term portion of deferred income taxes  self insurance liabilities  unrecognized income tax benefits  closed store liabilities and obligations for employee benefit plans for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond months from december  accordingly  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable  legally binding and specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancelation penalty under the agreement 
our open purchase orders related to merchandise inventory are based on current operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short period of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders binding agreements 
accordingly  we have excluded open purchase orders from the above table 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional considerations 
many of these incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less short term 
volume rebates and cooperative advertising allowances not offsetting in sg a are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 

table of contents cooperative advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor products are included as an offset to sg a when the cost is incurred 
certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met 
amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes 
total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
similarly  we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
however  these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
short term incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any short term agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables  net except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets  net 
we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations 
historically  the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant 
a difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
an increase to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase to our cost of sales 
conversely  a decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as a decrease to our cost of sales 
our inventory reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise  among other things 
we establish reserves for estimated store shrink at a point in time based on results of physical inventories conducted by independent third parties in substantially all our stores over the course of the year  results from other targeted inventory counts in our stores and historical and current loss trends 
in our distribution facilities  we perform cycle counts throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements 
we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our shrink reserve and that any differences in our shrink rate in the future would not have a material impact on our shrink reserve 
while our shrink expense increased in fiscal from a loss of inventory as determined by the completion of physical inventories in our stores  our shrink rate has fluctuated less than basis points over the last three years 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrink reserve 
furthermore  we have consistently completed a similar number of physical inventories at comparable times throughout the year 
our inventory consists primarily of parts  batteries  accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives 
although the risk of obsolescence is minimal  we also consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for effectively managing slower moving inventory 
we strive to optimize the life cycle of our inventory to ensure our product availability reflects customer demand 
we have return rights with many of our vendors and the majority of excess inventory is returned to our vendors for full credit 
we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels  ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions 
in certain situations  we establish reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory  changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  warranty reserves we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties  the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer warranty is borne by our vendors 
however  we have an 
table of contents obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer 
merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks 
we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense  the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
a change in the warranty reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  self insurance reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
historically  our total self insurance reserves have steadily increased due to our continued growth  including an increase in stores  team members and commercial delivery vehicles 
in fiscal  we experienced a reduction in our self insurance reserves primarily due to a drop in severity of medical claims and favorable claims development related to our workers compensation claims 
our self insurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed  claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims and is established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
specific factors include  but are not limited to  assumptions about health care costs  the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims 
generally  claims for automobile and general liability and workers compensation take several years to settle 
effective january   we classified million of our self insurance liability as long term because the timing of future payments is now more predictable based on the historical patterns and maturity of the program and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding sg a could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units 
these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units 
the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units  including but not limited to size and projected growth 
we have allocated our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets within each of our reportable segments to multiple reporting units in our aap segment and to the entire ai segment  respectively 
during the year  management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the periods presented  no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

table of contents income tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law  codes  regulations  pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  the evolution of tax law  codes  regulations and court cases  along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  new accounting pronouncements for a description of recently announced accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects  if any  on our consolidated financial statements  see new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
interest rate risk our primary financial market risk is due to changes in interest rates 
historically  we have reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements 
we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances 
our interest rate hedge instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges 
from september through january  we executed a series of forward treasury rate locks in anticipation of the issuance of the notes 
the treasury rate locks  which are derivative instruments  were designated as cash flow hedges to offset our exposure to increases in the underlying us treasury benchmark rate 
this rate was used to establish the fixed interest rate for our notes which was comprised of the underlying us treasury benchmark rate  plus a credit spread premium 
upon issuance of the notes  the cumulative change in fair market value of the treasury rate locks was not significant due to the narrow margin between the lock rate and the underlying treasury rate 
the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based  at the company s option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
at december  we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
however  if we elect to borrow on our revolving credit facility  we may be exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in libor or an alternate base rate 
there is no interest rate risk associated with our notes or notes  as the interest rates are fixed at and  respectively  per annum 
credit risk our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables 
we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers 
our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances  which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base 
we strive to maintain a close working relationship with our vendors and frequently monitor their financial strength 
we have not historically had significant credit losses
