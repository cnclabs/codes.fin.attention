item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a delaware holding company organized in that offers scheduled passenger services through our wholly owned operating air carrier subsidiaries chautauqua airlines  inc chautauqua  shuttle america corporation shuttle  republic airline inc republic airline and frontier airlines  inc frontier 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the terms the company  we  us  or our  refer to republic airways holdings inc and our subsidiaries 
as of december   our operating subsidiaries offered scheduled passenger service on  flights daily to cities in states  the bahamas  canada  costa rica  dominican republic  jamaica  mexico  and the turks and caicos islands under scheduled passenger service or pro rate operations as frontier airlines and through fixed fee code share agreements with amr corp  the parent of american airlines  inc american  continental airlines  inc 
continental  delta air lines  inc delta  united air lines  inc 
united  and us airways  inc us airways collectively referred to as our partners 
currently  we provide our partners with fixed fee regional airline services  operating as americanconnection  continental express  delta connection  united express  or us airways express  including service out of their hubs and focus cities 
fleet composition the following table outlines the type of aircraft our subsidiaries operate and their respective operations within our business units as of december  schedule of operational aircraft operating subsidiaries aircraft size seats frontier american continental delta united us airways spares number of aircraft chautauqua to shuttle america to republic airline to frontier to total number of operating aircraft during  our operational fleet remained the same at the company returned to the lessor or sold two erj s  five es  two as  and four as 
three erj s were subleased  and the company took delivery of one a aircraft and fifteen q aircraft 
included in the operational fleet there are three erj aircraft that operated as charter service  serve as operational spares  or are temporarily parked 
our frontier operations consist of all airbus operations at frontier 
additionally  included within the republic segment are regional jet aircraft operated by republic under a pro rate agreement with frontier 
frontier  which we purchased out of bankruptcy in  is a low fare carrier in denver  colorado 
during  we successfully restructured frontier and reported operating income improvement of million in we view frontier as an efficient  low cost producer of narrowbody capacity and believe it is well positioned to compete in denver 
we have fixed fee regional jet code share agreements with each of our partners that require us to maintain specified performance levels 
pursuant to these fixed fee agreements  which provide for minimum aircraft utilization at fixed rates  we are authorized to use our partners two character flight designation codes to identify our flights and fares in our partners computer reservation systems  to paint our aircraft in the style of our partners  to use their service marks and to market ourselves as a carrier for our partners 
our fixed fee agreements have historically limited our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
separation the company continues to make progress with its efforts to sell frontier  however  we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing of when  or if  such a transaction could be consummated 
we do believe any such transaction would have a material impact to our financial position and results of operations  and could have a significant impact to the price of our common stock 
segments based on our continual monitoring of the long term economic characteristics  airline processes  class of customer  and route operations flown as a part of our operating segments  we identified a change in our operating segments during the first quarter of the company has adjusted its presentation of business segments in and has revised the prior two year information to conform to the current period segment presentation 
we believe this segmentation is appropriate based upon operating decisions and performance assessments by our chief operating decision maker 
the company has identified two reportable segments republic and frontier 
our republic segment includes all regional flying performed under fixed fee and pro rate agreements  subleasing activities  regional charter operations and the cost of any unallocated regional aircraft 
the frontier segment includes passenger service revenues and expenses for operating our airbus fleet  as well as charter and cargo operations at frontier 
pro rate agreements under the company pro rate agreements  republic is allocated an industry standard pro rata portion of ticket revenue  while frontier retains all connect revenues as well as ancillary revenues on regional flights 
frontier maintains certain rights to deploy the regional aircraft and maintains control of pricing and revenue management 
frontier also retains responsibility for all customer service expenses  including airport rents 
selling and distribution costs are shared between republic and frontier 
republic incurs fuel expense based on gallons consumed flying under the pro rate agreement 
business strategy republic continue to operate a high quality fleet of aircraft across an efficient network we intend to maintain a modern  high quality fleet of regional aircraft that meets or exceeds stringent industry operating standards and complies with the terms of our fixed fee regional aircraft code share agreements 
we believe we have highly efficient flight and maintenance operations due to leveraging large crew and maintenance bases across multiple partners networks 
continue to provide efficient and effective solutions to our partners we have strong  long term relationships with each of our partners and have historically worked together with them to meet their operational and network needs 
historically  we have provided safe  reliable  and cost efficient solutions for our partners 
we remain focused on anticipating and continuing to assist our partners with their business strategies 
take advantage of growth opportunities to operate larger regional jets network carrier consolidation  along with high fuel prices  has limited the economic use of smaller regional jets 
our partners have shown an interest in having more  larger regional jets in their networks 
we believe our existing relationship with our partners and our strong relationship with embraer make us well positioned to take advantage of any growth opportunities 
on january   the company announced that it had reached an agreement with american to operate embraer e aircraft under the american eagle brand with service to start in june  this agreement was subsequently amended on february  to reduce the number of covered aircraft from to the amended agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court on march  in the american bankruptcy proceedings 
frontier compete effectively by providing our customers with low fares on our low cost  narrowbody aircraft frontier offers a differentiated customer experience with its livetv and bundled fare offerings through its classic and classic plus products  which are available for purchase on flyfrontier 
com 
we believe the restructuring completed in provides frontier with low cost narrowbody aircraft  which allows us to compete effectively in our highly contested markets 
further lower our unit costs cost per available seat mile casm to become an ultra low cost carrier we are focused on our effort to further reduce operating costs at frontier by increasing seat density and reducing sales and distribution costs 
frontier continues to simplify its fleet by removing regional aircraft flown by our other subsidiaries 
additionally  frontier will continue to replace smaller a and a aircraft with larger a aircraft as opportunities arise  which will help reduce casm 
continue to work towards brand preference in denver  colorado and expand frontier network in other strategic locations we remain focused on right sizing our network in denver and we are developing new point to point opportunities in markets where we have competitive advantages because of our low costs 
increase ancillary sales per passenger by utilizing ultra low cost carrier methodologies historically  frontier ancillary revenues have been lower than other low cost carriers 
we are evaluating other ancillary revenue opportunities and anticipate an increase in our ancillary sales per passenger in future periods 
revenue fixed fee service under our code share arrangements with our partners  we receive fixed fees  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior performance 
for the years ended december   and  all of our fixed fee revenue was earned under our fixed fee arrangements 
the number of aircraft we operate and aircraft utilization are the most significant drivers of our revenue  as opposed to the number of passengers we carry or the fare the passengers pay 
passenger service branded passenger service includes passenger ticket revenue and pro rate revenue on our frontier airline 
unlike our fixed fee business  the most significant drivers of our revenue are the number of passengers we carry and the fare paid by the passenger 
charter and other revenue charter and other revenue primarily consists of revenue related to our dedicated and co sold scheduled charters  the marketing component of our co branded credit cards  cargo revenues  interline and ground handling fees  and lease revenue for aircraft subleased under operating leases 
charter and cargo revenues are recognized at the point that our charter service and cargo revenue is realizable and earned  which is when the transportation is provided 
all other revenue is recognized as revenue when the related goods and services are provided 
charter revenue for the twelve months ended december   and was million  million  and million respectively 
the increase in charter revenues is due to the start up of our relationship with apple vacations that began in october operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expenses line items follows 
wages and benefits this expense includes not only wages and salaries  but also expenses associated with various employee benefit plans  employee incentives  stock compensation  and payroll taxes 
these expenses will fluctuate based primarily on our level of operations  changes in wage rates for contract  and non contract employees and changes in costs of our benefit plans 
aircraft fuel as of december   all of our aircraft fuel for the fixed fee operations is supplied directly by our code share partners  and thus  we do not record expense or the related revenue for those gallons of fuel 
beginning in july  we did not record fuel expense and the related revenue for the united operations 
we also did not pay for or record fuel expense and the related revenue for continental  american  delta or us airways operations 
all fuel costs including into plane fees and taxes are expensed as incurred for our frontier operations 
aircraft fuel also includes the realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments on fuel derivatives 
landing fees and airport rents this expense consists of an estimate of fees charged by airports for each aircraft landing and airport rental fees for ticket counter  gate and common space 
under our fixed fee agreements  we are generally reimbursed for the actual costs of landing fees 
landing fees and airport rents are expensed as incurred for the frontier operations 
aircraft and engine rent this expense consists of the costs of leasing aircraft and spare engines 
the leased aircraft and spare engines are operated under long term operating leases with third parties 
aircraft rent is reduced by the amortization of deferred credits received from the aircraft manufacturer for parts and training 
the credits are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease of the aircraft 
maintenance and repair maintenance and repair expenses include all parts  materials  tooling and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
we have entered into long term maintenance power by the hour service contracts with third party maintenance providers under which we are charged fixed rates for each flight hour accumulated by the majority of our engines and some of the major airframe components 
the effect of such contracts is to reduce the volatility of aircraft maintenance expense over the term of the contract 
all other maintenance is expensed as incurred under the direct expense method of accounting 
insurance and taxes this expense includes the costs of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance  war risk insurance and all other insurance policies  other than employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes personal and real property taxes  including aircraft property taxes 
under our current fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of passenger liability insurance  war risk insurance  aircraft hull insurance and property taxes  subject to certain restrictions 
under our us airways and united fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of such items other than aircraft hull insurance  which is reimbursed at agreed upon rates 
depreciation and amortization this expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft  and the amortization of intangible assets with definite lives 
promotion and sales this expense is incurred on our frontier operation only and consists of advertising costs  passenger reservation and booking fees  credit card processing fees and commissions 
other impairment charges this expense includes the impairment of aircraft and other equipment  trade names  and other assets 
other this expense includes the costs of crew training  crew travel  airport  passenger and ground handling related expenses  all hangar and administrative lease expenses  professional fees  and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
additionally  if incurred  this expense will include aircraft return costs  gains and losses on disposal of assets  reorganization costs  severance costs and bad debt expenses 
results of operations based on our continual monitoring of the long term economic characteristics  airline processes  class of customer  and route operations flown as a part of our operating segments  we have identified each of our operating segments below as reportable segments 
we changed our presentation of business segments in primarily due to changes in management and organizational structure  and we have revised information for all periods presented to conform to the current period segment presentation 
we believe this segmentation is appropriate based upon operating decisions and performance assessments by our chief operating decision maker 
we have identified two reportable segments republic and frontier 
our republic segment includes all regional flying performed under fixed fee and pro rate agreements  subleasing activities  regional charter operations and the cost of any unallocated regional aircraft 
the frontier segment includes passenger service revenues and expenses for operating our airbus fleet  as well as charter and cargo operations at frontier 
under our pro rate agreements  republic is allocated an industry standard pro rata portion of ticket revenue  while frontier retains all connect revenues as well as ancillary revenues on regional flights 
frontier maintains certain rights to deploy the regional aircraft and maintains control of pricing and revenue management 
frontier also retains responsibility for all customer service expenses  including airport rents 
selling and distribution costs are shared between republic and frontier

revenue passenger miles are the number of scheduled miles flown by revenue passengers 
available seat miles are the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of scheduled miles those seats are flown 
passenger load factor is revenue passenger miles divided by available seat miles 
total operating costs divided by available seat miles 
costs in all periods exclude impairments and other expenses not attributable to either republic or frontier segments 
total operating and interest expenses excluding other impairment charges is not a calculation based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered as an alternative to total operating expenses

the decrease in pro rate flying represents approximately million 
the company removed aircraft throughout from pro rate service for frontier 
some of these aircraft were redeployed erj aircraft for cpa flying  erj aircraft for sublease flying  however erj aircraft were sold and erj aircraft was returned to lessor  resulting in an overall reduction in flying compared to the prior year 
this decrease was offset by an increase in cpa flying of million primarily driven by the aircraft we redeployed as discussed above 
in addition  effective july   united agreed to supply fuel directly to our flights under its code share agreements and the company will no longer recognize the cost of fuel and related revenue for fuel used under the united code share agreement 
the reduction in pass through fuel revenue represented approximately million of the overall reduction in republic revenue 
factors relating to changes in operating expenses are discussed below the increase in wages and benefits unit cost of per asm was primarily related to an increase in benefit costs and normal merit and seniority related increases 
in addition  during the company began to reduce its administrative fee to frontier for overhead and support services 
this reduced level of synergies negatively impacted the republic segment 
wages and benefits may continue to increase for our republic segment in future periods as we continue to prepare for the possible separation of frontier 
the decrease in aircraft fuel was primarily due to united paying for fuel for cpa flying in the second half of the year  coupled with the decrease in gallons consumed because of a reduction in pro rate flying for frontier 
maintenance and repair unit cost increased per asm primarily due to an increase in scheduled heavy check maintenance on all aircraft and engine restorations on seat aircraft 
the decrease in promotion and sales unit cost was primarily related to the reduction in pro rate flying for frontier 
the impairment in was primarily attributable to charge on the erj aircraft and related aircraft equipment and spare parts on the q aircraft 
there were no impairment charges in frontier compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased by as a result of an improvement in frontier unit revenues that was driven by a higher load factor  coupled with an increase in charter and other revenue 
we continue to strive to improve frontier unit revenues by continuing to find opportunities to exchange our a a aircraft for a aircraft 
factors relating to changes in operating expenses are discussed below wages and benefits cost decreased by per asm  due primarily to an increase in the average seat density of the airbus aircraft and a decrease in the administrative fees charged by republic as discussed above 
aircraft fuel unit cost increased primarily due to the rise in the cost per gallon  in compared to in  partially offset by a reduction in gallons consumed 
promotion and sales unit cost decreased primarily due to the company consistent strategy to reduce marketing costs and advertising expense  and a measurable shift in passenger bookings to internal channels 
other expenses unit cost decreased primarily due to lower write offs of maintenance reserves during compared to consolidated we recorded an income tax expense of million or effective tax rate during  compared with an income tax benefit of million or effective tax rate during the effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate due to miscellaneous permanent tax adjustments in the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate due to non deductible meals and entertainment expense  primarily for our flight crews

as of december   the company was under a capacity purchase agreement for flying between republic and frontier 
since frontier recorded the entire amount of ticket revenue in  the million of payments made to republic by frontier during under the cpa was recorded as a reduction of expense in the republic segment 
the segments were previously disclosed in three reportable segments fixed fee  branded  and other 
fixed fee services were typically operated under an agreement with a domestic network airline partner 
branded operations related to the passenger service revenues and expenses generated under the company branded airlines 
the other segment consisted of slot leasing activities  charter operations  and idle or unallocated aircraft not currently assigned to other operations 
based on the the new segments for the company reclassified the segments by combining fixed fee  other  cpa flying  and midwest flying to form the republic segment and the branded segment was reclassified to form the frontier segment 
operating revenues operating revenue increased by 
this increase is mainly related to the difference in recording revenue under the pro rate agreement with frontier in compared to the legacy capacity purchase agreement with frontier that was recorded as a reduction of expense for factors relating to changes in operating expenses are discussed below wages and benefits cost per available seat mile decreased primarily due to a reduction in merit increases for compared to as well as an increase in the the administrative fee charged to frontier 
the increase in aircraft fuel was primarily due to an increase in the average cost per gallon  coupled with an increase in gallons consumed because of pro rate fuel being recorded on the republic segment 
maintenance and repair unit cost increased per asm primarily due to higher scheduled heavy check maintenance and more engine restorations on seat aircraft 
as discussed above  the million credit represents payments from frontier to republic under the cpa 
this balance is eliminated in the consolidated financial statement 
the decrease in promotion and sales unit cost was primarily related to the reduction in advertising expense year over year 
the increase in impairment charges unit cost was related to the write down of our erj aircraft and related aircraft equipment 
the increase in other expenses unit cost to in compared to in was related to increased costs in restructuring and other transition expenses 
frontier compared to operating revenues operating revenue in decreased by  the decrease is mainly related to the pro rate revenue being recorded on the republic segment under the pro rate agreement during  whereas all ticket revenue was recorded on the frontier segment during under the legacy capacity purchase agreement 
factors relating to changes in operating expenses are discussed below wages and benefits cost per available seat mile increased to for compared to in primarily due to an increase in the administrative fee charged by republic as discussed above 
the increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily due to the increase in the average cost per gallon  partially offset by a decrease in gallons 
the increase in aircraft and engine rent unit cost was primarily due to the addition of eight leased a aircraft into our frontier fleet in as discussed above  the million expense represents expense recorded on frontier for republic flying under the cpa 
this balance is eliminated in the consolidated financial statement 
the increase in impairment charges was primarily attributable to a charge on a aircraft in there were no impairment charges in the decrease in other expense unit cost was primarily due to a decrease in integration expense in  partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs in consolidated we incurred an income tax benefit of million during  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
in and  the rate was lower than the statutory rate due to non deductible meals and entertainment expenses  primarily for flight crews  that are non deductible for federal and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources compared to as of december   we had total cash of million of which million was unrestricted 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
the company currently anticipates that its unrestricted cash on hand  the cash generated from operations  and other financings will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we are required to maintain million of unrestricted cash on certain financial agreements 
our ability to maintain unrestricted cash levels above this minimum unrestricted cash covenant is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations to fund operating expenses  maintenance deposits for leased aircraft  maturities of debt  capital expenditures and other contractual obligations 
the company currently anticipates that its unrestricted cash on hand  the cash generated from operations  and potential other liquidity initiatives  including but not limited to asset sales  or financings will be sufficient to meet its minimum cash covenants and anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  however  there can be no assurances to that effect 
working capital deficits are customary for airlines since the air traffic liability and a portion of the deferred frequent flyer revenue are classified as current liabilities 
our liquidity depends on the number of passengers who fly in our frontier operations  the fares they pay  the cost of fuel  our operating and capital expenditures  our financing activities  the financial strength of our partners in relation to our fixed fee business  and the amount of cash holdbacks imposed by our credit card processors 
we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  an economic recession  a global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the increase in net income and timing differences in our working capital in compared to net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
in  the company had proceeds from the sale of e aircraft and other assets of million  offset by capital expenditures of million compared to proceeds from the sale of aircraft and other assets of million  offset by capital expenditures of million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in net cash used was million 
the company made scheduled principal repayments of million and extinguished million of aircraft debt compared to repayments of million and extinguishments of million in the company received proceeds related to spare parts financing and restructuring of our small jet business of million in  compared to million in other liquidity initiatives the company possible financing sources include the issuance of new debt secured by spare parts  sale of aircraft  the sale or monetization of certain assets  the issuance of unsecured debt  the refinancing of aircraft debt  and the issuance of our common stock 
a substantial portion of the company assets are encumbered  and the company has a limited quantity of assets that could be used as collateral in future financings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining financings at sufficient levels or at acceptable terms 
an inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company financial condition 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under certain of our financing arrangements 
we are required to maintain million of unrestricted cash and comply with certain operational related non financial covenants on certain financing agreements 
if the company fails to meet such covenants  the company would incur a million per month reduction in liquidity 
as of december   we were in compliance with all our covenants 
letters of credit as we enter new markets  increase the amount of space we lease  or add leased aircraft  we are often required to provide the airport authorities and lessors with a letter of credit 
we also provide letters of credit for our workers compensation insurance 
as of december  and  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  all of which are bond and cash collateralized 
the cash collateralized against the letters of credit are recorded in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
aircraft and other leases we have significant obligations for aircraft and engines that are classified as operating leases and  therefore  are not reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet 
aircraft leases expire between and as of december   our total mandatory payments under operating leases for aircraft aggregated approximately billion and total minimum annual aircraft rental payments for the next months under all non cancelable operating leases is approximately million 
other non cancelable operating leases consist of engines  terminal space  operating facilities  office space and office equipment 
the leases expire through as of december   our total mandatory payments under other non cancelable operating leases aggregated approximately million 
total minimum annual other rental payments for the next months are approximately million 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with continental airlines  inc to operate q aircraft under the united express brand 
the aircraft and spare engines will be operated under operating leases and therefore are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
our aircraft leases for these aircraft expire between and if there is a breach in the agreement  the liability to the company is no longer mandatory  and lease responsibility reverts back to the original lessor 
as of december   our total payments under the operating leases for aircraft and engines aggregated approximately million and total minimum annual aircraft and engine rental payments for the next months under these operating leases is approximately million 
commitments and obligations as of december   the company had firm orders to purchase cs aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in early and continuing through  and sixty airbus neo aircraft and twenty airbus neo aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in early and continuing through the company also has a commitment to acquire six spare aircraft engines and expects to take delivery of two engines in  three engines in and one engine beyond on january   the company announced that it had reached an agreement with american to operate embraer e aircraft under the american eagle brand 
the aircraft are expected to be phased into operation at approximately two to three aircraft per month beginning in mid through the first quarter of this agreement was subsequently amended on february  to reduce the number of covered aircraft from to the amended agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court on march  in the american bankruptcy proceedings 
the total commitment for the aircraft is up to billion over the year phase in period 
the company has arranged suitable financing with current market commercial terms 
this commitment is not outstanding in the table below  as commitment was not outstanding at december  we expect to fund future capital and funding commitments through internally generated funds  third party aircraft financings  and debt and other financings 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  include the following in millions payments due by period beyond total long term debt including interest operating leases tax liability for uncertain tax positions debt or lease financed aircraft purchase obligations engines under firm orders total contractual cash obligations we have maintenance agreements for engines  auxiliary power units apu and other airframe components for our e  e  q and airbus aircraft 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the engines  apus  avionics  wheels and brakes  and select rotable parts through december  june  december  june  and september  respectively 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the avionics  wheels and brakes  apus  engines  emergency slides  and select rotable parts through december  february  july  december  may  and january  respectively 
for our q aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the tires  brakes  apus  spare parts  engines  and propellors through july  august  july  july  june  and july  respectively 
for our airbus aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the brakes  tires  and avionics through december  december  and december  respectively 
under these agreements  we are charged for covered services based on a fixed rate for each flight hour or flight cycle accumulated by the engines or airframes in our service during each month 
the rates are subject to annual revisions  generally based on certain bureau of labor statistics labor and material indices 
we believe these agreements  coupled with our ongoing maintenance program  reduce the likelihood of unexpected levels of engine  apu  avionics  wheels and brakes  emergency slides  and select rotable parts maintenance expense during their term 
certain of these agreements contain minimum guarantee amounts  penalty provisions for either the early removal of aircraft or agreement termination for activity levels below the minimums 
we do not have long term maintenance agreements for our airbus aircraft and some embraer aircraft except for the information above  and we have made significant deposits with the aircraft lessors for future maintenance events which will reduce future cash requirements 
as of december  and we had maintenance deposits of million and million  respectively 
total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant tax payments in critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
some of those estimates and judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and we reasonably could have used different estimates in the current period  or changes in these estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period as new information becomes available  and a change in these estimates would have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations 
we continually evaluate the estimates and judgments used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical based on the criteria above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in any one period 
revenue recognition passenger service passenger service revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided or after the tickets expire which is either immediately upon the scheduled departure of the flight or up to thirteen months after the date of issuance depending on the type of ticket purchased  and are net of excise taxes  passenger facility charges and security fees 
passenger service revenues that have been deferred are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as air traffic liability 
included in passenger service revenue are change fees imposed on passengers for making schedule changes to non refundable tickets 
change fees are recognized as revenue at the time the change is made for the passenger as these fees are a separate transaction that occur subsequent to the date of the original ticket sale 
the company is required to charge certain taxes and fees on passenger tickets 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes 
these taxes and fees are legal assessments on the customer  for which the company has an obligation to act as a collection agent 
because the company is not entitled to retain these taxes and fees  such amounts are not included in passenger service revenue 
the company records a liability when the amounts are collected and reduces the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier 
frequent flyer programs the company has a frequent flyer program that offers incentives to travel on its airlines and promotes customer loyalty 
the program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on frontier and through participating companies  such as credit card companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
the company also sells mileage credits to nonairline businesses 
the mileage credits may be redeemed for free air travel on frontier  as well as hotels  rental cars  and other awards 
mileage credits earned on frontier the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated selling price of the air transportation for mileage credits awarded and recognizes that amount as passenger service revenue when the mileage credit is redeemed and the transportation is provided 
the estimated selling price of the air transportation component is determined utilizing the deferred revenue method as further described below 
the initial revenue deferral is presented as deferred frequent flyer revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
when recognized  the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as passenger service revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company s accounting policy for its frequent flyer program is the deferred revenue method 
the deferred revenue method is to record the frequent flyer obligation by allocating an estimated selling price to each outstanding mile based on projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed 
such value is estimated assuming redemptions on our airline  and other redemption choices and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service and redemption choices 
the estimated selling price of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required 
for example  management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on the company s airline versus on other redemption choices 
since the estimated selling price of miles redeemed on frontier and other redemption choices can vary greatly  this assumption can materially affect the estimated selling price from period to period 
the company accounts for expired mileage credits under the expiration recognition method 
frequent flyer liability is reduced in the period when mileage credits become inactive or expire unused in accordance with the then existing early returns program requirements 
management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of frontier customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles  each of which can have materially different estimated values 
such choices include different classes of service and award levels 
customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes  which occur from time to time  introducing new award choices or making material changes to the terms of existing award choices 
management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior  which requires the use of significant judgment 
management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates  but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior patterns  which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in historical changes to deferred frequent flyer revenue balances and to recognized revenue 
the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles  regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award 
eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to redeem awards  or their account will deactivate after a period of inactivity  in which case the company will recognize the related revenue when the miles expire as passenger service revenue 
during  we notified frontier early returns members that program rules would change such that miles will now expire in an account with no activity in the last months as compared to months prior to the change 
early return members were notified early in the fourth quarter that they needed to add miles to their account by december  in order to keep their account active assuming their account did not have positive activity for the past months as of december  
as a result of this change in the early returns program for frontier  we recognized additional revenue and a corresponding decrease in the frequent flyer liability of approximately million due to the expiration of mileage credits on december  current and future changes to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred frequent flyer revenue balance as well as recognized revenue from the program 
impairments to long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and residual values for our definite lived assets 
as a result of the company s impairment test for the indefinite lived other intangible assets and aircraft and other equipment the company recorded an impairment for aircraft and other equipment during there were no impairment charges in see note in item aircraft maintenance and repair 
the company charges expenses as incurred under the direct expense method 
engines and certain airframe component overhaul and repair costs are subject to power by the hour contracts with external vendors and are expensed as the aircraft are flown 
the company also has deposits related to leased aircraft 
deposits are reimbursed based on the specific event for each specified deposit  as determined by the lease 
as of december   the company has evaluated the carrying amount of maintenance deposits and believes the deposits are recoverable when the future maintenance event occurs and the company is reimbursed 
the company has determined that it is probable that substantially all maintenance deposits will be refunded through qualifying maintenance activities  except for deposits related to certain aircraft that are expected to be returned to the lessor in and this analysis was performed by lease and by deposit type 
the company will continue to evaluate whether it is probable the deposits will be returned to reimburse the costs of the maintenance activities incurred 
deposits will be recognized as additional expense when they are less than probable of being returned 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
certain of our nols generated prior to july and acquired from business acquisitions are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of deferred tax asset  and other carry forwards becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized 
at december   we had estimated federal net operating loss carry forwards  which we refer to as nols  of billion for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in we have recorded a valuation allowance for million of those nols 
section of the internal revenue code  which we refer to as section  imposes limitations on a corporation ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
in the event of an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section any unused nols in excess of the annual limitation may be carried over to later years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have been and are subject to market risks  including commodity price risk such as  to a limited extent  aircraft fuel prices and interest rate risk 
interest rates our earnings can be affected by changes in interest rates due to the amount of cash and securities held and variable rate debt 
at december  and  approximately million and million of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates  respectively 
a one hundred basis point change in the libor rate would have increased or decreased interest expense by million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through the manufacturer  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements  our reimbursement rates may not be adjusted higher or lower to reflect any changes in our aircraft rental rates 
aircraft fuel price risk our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk  we periodically purchase call options  enter into fuel swap agreements  or enter into costless collars on various oil derivative commodities 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we choose not to designate these derivatives as hedges  and  as such  realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments are included in aircraft fuel expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a one dollar change in price per barrel of crude oil will increase or decrease our fuel expense by million 
a one cent change in the cost of each gallon of fuel would impact our pre tax income by approximately million per year based on our current fleet and aircraft fuel consumption 
under our fixed fee agreements we are not exposed to changes in fuel prices 
our fixed fee agreements provide for our partners to purchase fuel directly or reimburse us for fuel expense as a pass through cost 
as of december   the company outstanding hedge position was immaterial to the financial statements 
the company has a hedge position on of its anticipated volume of fuel through the nd quarter of we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and may take advantage of more fuel hedging opportunities as they become available
