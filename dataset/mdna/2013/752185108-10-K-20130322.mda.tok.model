business overview rand capital corporation rand was incorporated under the law of new york in beginning in  rand operated as a publicly traded  closed end  diversified management company that was registered under section of the investment company act of the act 
in  rand elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the act 
in  rand formed a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of operating it as a small business investment company sbic licensed by the us small business administration sba 
the subsidiary received an sba license to operate as an sbic in august the subsidiary  which had been organized as a delaware limited partnership  was converted into a new york corporation on december   at which time its operations as a licensed small business investment company were continued by a newly formed corporation under the name of rand capital sbic  inc rand sbic 
on february  the sec granted an order of exemption for rand with respect to the operations of rand sbic 
at that time  although rand sbic was operated as if it were a bdc  it was registered as an investment company under the act 
upon the corporation s receipt of the order granting the exemptions described above  on march   rand sbic filed an election to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
the following discussion describes the operations of rand and its wholly owned subsidiary rand sbic collectively  the corporation 
the corporation anticipates that most  if not all  of its investments in the next year will be originated through rand sbic 
the corporation s primary business is making subordinated debt and equity investments in small and medium sized companies that meet certain criteria  including a qualified and experienced management team a new or unique product or service with a sustainable competitive advantage high potential for growth in revenue and cash flow potential to realize appreciation in an equity position  if any 

table of contents the corporation typically makes initial investments of  to  directly in a company through equity shares or in debt or loan instruments 
the debt instruments generally have a maturity of not more than five years and usually have detachable equity warrants 
interest is either paid currently or deferred 
the corporation s management team identifies investment opportunities through a network of investment referral relationships 
investment proposals may  however  come to the corporation from many other sources  including unsolicited proposals from companies and referrals from banks  lawyers  accountants and other members of the financial community 
the corporation believes that its reputation in the investment community and experience provide a competitive advantage in originating qualified new investments 
in a typical private financing  the management team of the corporation will review  analyze  and confirm  through due diligence  the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company 
additionally  the corporation will become familiar with the portfolio company s industry and competitive landscape and may conduct reference checks with customers and suppliers of the portfolio company 
following an initial investment in a portfolio company  the corporation may make follow on investments in the portfolio company 
follow on investments may be made to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to the corporation or to increase or maintain the corporation s position in a promising portfolio company 
the corporation may also be called upon to provide an additional investment to a portfolio company in order for that company to fully implement its business plans  to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems 
follow on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated individually and may be subject to regulatory restrictions 
the corporation may exit investments through the maturation of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place  such as the sale  recapitalization  or initial public offering of a portfolio company 
the method and timing of the disposition of the corporation s portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return 
the corporation generally expects to dispose of its equity securities through private sales of securities to other investors or through an outright sale of the company or a merger 
the corporation anticipates its debt investments will be repaid with interest and hopes to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments it receives in connection with the origination of the investment 
the corporation funds new investments and operating expenses through existing cash balances  investment returns  and interest and principal payments from its portfolio companies 
highlights and outlook in general  the united states and global economic conditions continued to improve throughout although the us economy did shrink during the fourth quarter of for the first time since mid analysts are attributing the fourth quarter contraction to non recurring matters but a full economic recovery may take longer than expected due to various national and international issues which may have an adverse economic impact on all businesses  particularly small businesses 
to the extent the financial market conditions continue to improve  the corporation believes its financial condition and the financial condition of the portfolio companies will improve 
it remains difficult to forecast when future exits will happen 
the corporation s net asset value increased  or during  closing the year at per share  up from at december  at december   the corporation s total investment portfolio was valued at million  which exceeds its cost basis of million  reflecting million in net unrealized appreciation 
the corporation s common stock traded below its net asset value per share during and  closing at per share 
during  the corporation recognized  in total investment income  an increase of  from  of investment income in the increase is attributable to an increase in dividend income from  in to  in the corporation received dividends from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies  which as a group comprise approximately of the value of the corporation s portfolio at december  dividends from these portfolio companies may fluctuate from period to period based not only on the profitability of the portfolio company but also on the timing of distributions the companies make 

table of contents the corporation recognized a realized net gain of  during and its investment valuation changes resulted in a net increase in unrealized appreciation of  total expenses remained fairly steady at  for the year ended december   which represented a  or increase from the expense amount of  critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance a reader s ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most important estimate in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
the corporation invests in loan instruments  debt instruments  and equity instruments 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment and employing a consistent valuation process 
the corporation analyzes and values each investment quarterly  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if the corporation s assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
on january   the corporation adopted accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
loan investments are defined as traditional loan financings with no equity features 
debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights  stock purchase warrants  and or stock purchase options 
a financing may also be categorized as a debt financing if it is accompanied by the direct purchase of an equity interest in the company 
the corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment 
the main approaches are loan and debt securities are valued at cost when it is representative of the fair value of an investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds exist from a sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value 
the loan and debt securities may be valued at an amount other than the price the security would command in order to provide a yield to maturity equivalent to the current yield of similar debt securities 
a loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality  collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist 
equity securities may be valued using the market approach or income approach 
the market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions 
it may 
table of contents include the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment 
additionally  the corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated  unrelated new investor 
the income approach employs a cash flow and discounting methodology to value an investment 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  used in the corporation s valuation at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value 
financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  which is not necessarily an indication of risks associated with the investment 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation 
under the valuation policy  the corporation values unrestricted publicly traded securities at the average closing bid price for these securities for the last three trading days of the month 
restricted publicly traded securities are valued at the average closing bid price for the last three trading days of the month and are discounted for the time restriction 
see subsequent event footnote disclosure regarding synacor 
in the valuation process  the corporation values private securities using the financial information from these portfolio companies  which may include audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio companies 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
the fair value determination of each portfolio investment categorized as level required one or more of the following unobservable inputs financial information obtained from each portfolio company  including unaudited statements of operations  balance sheets and operating budgets current and projected financial  operational and technological development of the portfolio company  current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations  the current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur  pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company  current information regarding any offers to purchase the company  or past sales transactions  current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed  changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company  internal occurrences that may have an impact both positive and negative on the operating performance of the portfolio company  qualitative assessment of key management  contractual rights  obligations or restrictions associated with the investment  and other factors deemed relevant 

table of contents equity securities equity securities may include preferred stock  common stock  warrants and limited liability company interests 
the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the corporation s equity investments are ebitda and revenue multiples  where applicable  the financial  technological development and operational performance of the business  or the senior equity preferences which may exist in a deemed liquidation event 
standard industry multiples may be used when available  however the corporation s portfolio companies are typically small and in early stages of development and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of the portfolio company 
due to the nature of certain investments  fair value measurements may be based on other criteria  which may include third party appraisals 
significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors by the portfolio company 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
when appropriate the black scholes pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of warrants for gaap accounting purposes 
this model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return in addition to variables for the valuation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies 
significant increases decreases in any of these unobservable inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement 
for recent investments  the corporation generally relies on the cost basis  which is judged to represent the fair value  unless other fair market value inputs form a basis to depart from cost 
loan and debt securities the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the corporation s loan and debt securities are the financial  technological development and operational performance of the portfolio company as well as the market acceptance for the portfolio company s products or service 
these inputs will provide an indicator as to the probability of principal recovery of the investment 
the corporation s debt investments will often be junior secured or unsecured debt securities  lacking sufficient collateral 
fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate 
significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement 
for recent investments  the corporation generally relies on its cost basis  which is deemed to represent the fair value  unless other fair market value inputs are identified causing the corporation to depart from this level 
revenue recognition interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
the rand sbic interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 

table of contents the corporation may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies 
these distributions are classified as dividend income on the statement of operations and are recognized when the amount can be reasonably estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements topic  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss asu 
asu results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the adoption of asu did not have a significant impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations
