introduction our company 
webmd health corp 
is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering on september  our common stock trades under the symbol wbmd on the nasdaq global select market 
from the completion of our initial public offering through the completion of our merger which we refer to as the merger with hlth corporation which we refer to as hlth on october   we were more than owned by hlth 
on october   the merger was completed  with hlth merging into webmd and webmd continuing as the surviving corporation 
accordingly  in this md a  webmd or the use of we  our  or similar words refers not only to webmd itself but also  where the context requires  to hlth 
the specific names of hlth and webmd are used only where there is a need to distinguish between the legal entities 
in the merger  each share of hlth common stock was converted into shares of webmd common stock 
our business 
we are a leading provider of health information services to consumers  physicians and other healthcare professionals  employers and health plans through our public and private online portals  mobile platforms and health focused publications 
our public portals for consumers enable them to obtain health and wellness information including information on specific diseases or conditions  check symptoms  locate physicians  store individual healthcare 
table of contents 
index to financial statements information  receive periodic e newsletters on topics of individual interest and participate in online communities with peers and experts 
our public portals for physicians and healthcare professionals make it easier for them to access clinical reference sources  stay abreast of the latest clinical information  learn about new treatment options  earn continuing medical education which we refer to as cme credit and communicate with peers 
we also provide mobile health information applications for use by consumers and physicians 
we generate revenue from our public portals primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products  as well as cme services 
our public portals sponsors and advertisers include  but are not limited to  pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  healthcare services companies  and consumer products companies whose products relate to health  wellness  diet  fitness  lifestyle  safety and illness prevention 
we also generate revenue from advertising sold in webmd magazine  a consumer magazine distributed to physician office waiting rooms 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of certain information products 
our private portals enable employers and health plans to provide their employees and members with access to personalized health and benefit information and decision support tools that help them to make more informed benefit  treatment and provider decisions and motivate them to make healthier lifestyle choices 
we also provide health and condition management programs for use by our private portals clients employees and members to help them achieve their wellness goals 
in addition  we offer clients telephonic  online and onsite health coaching services for their employees and members 
we generate revenue from our private portals through the licensing of our technology and content to employers and health plans  either directly or through our distributors 
we offer our health coaching services and our health and condition management programs on a per participant basis 
background information on certain trends and developments affecting our business 
key trends and developments affecting the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing and our ability to generate revenue from those services include the following use of the internet by consumers and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare related issues  motivated by the desire to become better informed patients and to become more engaged healthcare consumers because of the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers 
the internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information  enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet has become a primary source of information for physicians and other healthcare professionals seeking to improve clinical practice and to interact with their peers 
the internet has also become one of the primary means for physicians and other healthcare professionals to obtain cme and ce 
traffic trends 
in  the webmd health network reached an average of approximately million monthly unique visitors and delivered approximately billion page views during the year  increases of and over the prior year  respectively 
approximately of page views during and during were from international users of the webmd health network 
the prior year comparisons exclude traffic from webmd s former affiliate partner sites  which were phased out at the end of our professional sites received average total physician visits of approximately million per month in consumers and healthcare professionals are increasingly using smartphones  tablets and other mobile devices to access the internet  with physicians increasingly using mobile devices during treatment at the point of care 
accordingly  the portion of our page views from mobile devices has increased rapidly in the past several years 
approximately of our page views in and in were delivered to us mobile devices 
we are focused on delivering a multi screen platform that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements extends the user experience beyond the desktop portal onto the mobile device 
mobile  while not yet a meaningful source of revenue for us  could be an important area of growth for the future 
however  if users access our services through mobile devices as a substitute for access through personal computers  or if our page views from desktop computers decline for other reasons  and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile services  our financial results could be negatively affected 
online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of the advertisers and sponsors of our public portals  are aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians 
in addition  in an effort to improve operating efficiencies  some pharmaceutical companies have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years 
however  notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand  we cannot predict the extent or the pace of any shift by pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies of their marketing expenditures to online services 
in addition  as discussed under recent developments affecting our business and the demand for our services below  many of these companies have been reducing their overall marketing and education spending and are expected to continue to do so 
furthermore  our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including general economic and regulatory conditions and the following the majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months 
we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program  as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered  may be longer than expected  especially for medium sized and larger contracts  and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals  including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products 
we experienced  from time to time  a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  which has resulted in delays in contracting as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts and which may continue to cause such delays 
other factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors  or receipt of revenue under such contracts  include the timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products  the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of products from the market  consolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  the timing of roll outs of new or enhanced services on our public portals  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 
recent developments affecting our business and the demand for our services 
in  we experienced reduced public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue  compared to the prior year period  as a result of what we believe has been a more cautious business outlook by many of our larger customers 
in  some of our pharmaceutical company customers experienced patent expirations for certain of their products and  since then  other such customers have experienced such patent expirations or are expected to experience patent expirations in and over the next several years 
in the pharmaceutical industry  patent expirations allow for competition from lower priced generic versions of these drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug 
additionally  we believe that these 
table of contents 
index to financial statements patent expirations have also led to  and may continue to lead to  significant overall reductions in marketing  selling and educational expenditures by a number of these pharmaceutical companies across their entire product portfolios  as well as delays in their budgeting and purchase decisions 
we expect the trends that caused reductions in our revenue during to continue in as companies deal with both the ongoing and anticipated impact of patent expirations across their businesses as well as greater than expected delays in new product launches 
in addition to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  our public portals advertisers and sponsors include consumer products companies  particularly for their products that relate to health  wellness  diet  fitness  lifestyle  safety and illness prevention 
we are in the process of implementing a redesign of our online healthy living and lifestyle content  including in the areas of beauty  diet  food and fitness  and family and pregnancy  and are developing proprietary content and tools that help individuals live a healthy lifestyle 
revenues from consumer products companies are more likely to reflect general economic conditions  and to be reduced to a greater extent during economic downturns  than revenues from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies 
accordingly  revenues from these customers may continue to decline and may be subject to significant quarter to quarter variations 
our advertising and sponsorship services are subject to competition from numerous alternatives  including traditional media  internet search engines  social media internet sites  and general interest consumer sites 
such competition may result in smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices  both of which could reduce our revenues and profit margins 
in response to changes in the preferences of our advertisers and sponsors  particularly our pharmaceutical company clients  we have modified our sales and product approach to offer services that can be executed more quickly and we are simplifying our products and pricing 
we believe this will enable these clients to better compare our services  and the value they provide  to other digital alternatives 
we are also investing in more robust data and analytics capabilities 
this includes adding new capabilities in order to improve the user experience  better differentiate during the sales process and provide our customers with new value measurements and insights through proprietary analytics tools 
use of health management applications 
in a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been shifting to consumers  use of information technology to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that  through our private portals  we are well positioned to play a role in this environment 
however  our strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our private portals clients from those services 
increasing usage of our private portal services requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of online healthcare decision support tools and health management applications 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
we also expect that  for clients that have been adversely affected by general economic conditions or are seeking to reduce expenses for other reasons  we may continue to experience some reduction in contract renewals for our private portal services  as well as some reductions in the size of existing contracts 
international 
we are pursuing opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the united states 
in certain markets outside the united states  we expect that we would accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region  while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources 
in october  we launched our first major consumer portal outside the united states in partnership with boots  the united kingdom s leading pharmacy led health and beauty retailer 
in addition  in certain markets outside of the united states  we are providing some of our online services in the local language directly to healthcare professionals and  to a lesser extent  consumers 
the provision of online services in foreign languages presents additional challenges 
our company has only recently begun this activity and  therefore  has limited experience in this area 

table of contents 
index to financial statements healthcare reform legislation 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of which we refer to as the reform legislation  was signed into law in march the reform legislation makes extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the united states 
in general  the reform legislation seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal united states residents by  among other things  requiring individuals to carry  and certain employers to offer  health insurance or be subject to penalties 
the reform legislation also imposes new regulations on health insurers  including guaranteed coverage requirements  prohibitions on certain annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to plan members  increased restrictions on rescinding coverage  establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements  a requirement to cover certain preventive services on a first dollar basis  the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages  and greater limitations on how health insurers price certain of their products 
the reform legislation also contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies  including new taxes on certain sales of their products 
many of the provisions of the reform legislation that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until  and many provisions require regulations and interpretive guidance to be issued before they will be fully implemented 
some provisions do not apply to health plans that were in place when the reform legislation was enacted and have not been substantially changed since 
in addition  it is difficult to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the reform legislation 
furthermore  the reform legislation will result in future state legislative and regulatory changes  which we are unable to predict at this time  in order for states to comply with certain provisions of the reform legislation and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities 
in addition  congress has considered various proposals to repeal some or all of the reform legislation 
while we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on webmd as a direct result of the application of the reform legislation to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer  we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts of the reform legislation will be on webmd s business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants  including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of our public portals and employers and health plans that are clients of our private portals 
healthcare industry participants may respond to the reform legislation or to uncertainties created by the reform legislation by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions  including expenditures for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we believe that certain aspects of the reform legislation and future implementing regulations that seek to reduce healthcare costs may create opportunities for webmd  including with respect to our personal health record applications and health and benefits decision support tools and  more generally  with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education 
for example  the reform legislation encourages use of wellness programs through grants to small employers to establish such programs  permission for employers to offer larger rewards than under prior law  in the form of waivers of cost sharing  premium discounts  or additional benefits  to employees for participating in these programs and meeting certain standards  and the inclusion of wellness services and chronic disease management among the essential health benefits that certain plans are required to provide 
in addition  we believe that  as the reform legislation is implemented and consumers begin shopping for health insurance in the new markets that it creates  webmd will be well positioned to provide information and decision support tools to assist consumers in choosing an appropriate health plan for their needs 
however  we cannot yet determine the scope of any such opportunities or what competition we may face in our efforts to pursue such opportunities 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online and mobile services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our business from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements background information on certain significant developments and transactions restructuring 
on december   we announced a plan to streamline our operations  simplify our organizational structure  reduce costs and better focus our resources 
we expect that these actions will result in a reduction in annualized operating expenditures  including the impact of a workforce reduction of approximately positions  or roughly of our employees at that time 
in connection with this reduction in workforce  we recorded a restructuring charge of  during the three months ended december  related to severance and other employee benefits that were provided to terminated employees 
the remaining accrual related to this charge is  and is reflected within accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  voluntary surrender of certain option grants 
on february   our directors and certain officers voluntarily surrendered certain grants of non qualified options to purchase webmd common stock made to them  one of which was made in  some in and some in and all of which were out of the money at the time of surrender 
none of these individuals received any consideration or promise of consideration in exchange for the surrender of these stock options 
these options were originally granted under our long term incentive plan which we refer to as the plan  and therefore  upon their surrender  the shares underlying these options were returned to the plan and became available for grant under such plan 
these surrenders of stock options were intended to allow webmd to use the shares that became available under the plan to attract new employees and to motivate and retain current key employees 
during the first quarter of  we recorded pre tax stock based compensation expense of  related to the voluntary surrender of these options  which represented the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation amounts for such grants 
tender offers 
on april   we completed a tender offer for our common stock and repurchased  shares at a price of per share for a total cost of  which includes of costs directly attributable to the purchase 
on september   we completed a tender offer for our common stock and repurchased  shares at a price of per share for a total cost of  which includes of costs directly attributable to the purchase 
on april   we completed a tender offer which we refer to as the tender offer for our common stock and repurchased  shares at a price of per share for a total cost of  which includes of costs directly attributable to the purchase 
each of the tender offers described in this paragraph represented an opportunity for webmd to return capital to stockholders who elected to tender their shares of webmd common stock  while stockholders who chose not to participate in a tender offer automatically increased their relative percentage interest in our company at no additional cost to them 
stock repurchase programs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  through our stock repurchase programs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  through our stock repurchase programs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  through our stock repurchase programs 
convertible notes 
on january   we issued  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due which we refer to as the notes in a private offering 
unless previously converted  the notes will mature on january  net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately  after deducting the related offering expenses  of which approximately  was used by us to repurchase  shares of webmd common stock at a price of per share  the last reported sale price of webmd common stock on january   which repurchase settled on january  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on january and july of each year  commencing july  under the terms of the notes  as adjusted in april following completion of the tender offer  holders may surrender their notes for conversion into webmd common stock at a conversion rate of shares of webmd common stock per thousand dollars principal amount of the notes 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
in the aggregate  the notes are convertible into  shares of common stock following the april  adjustment

index to financial statements on march   we issued  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due which we refer to as the notes in a private offering 
unless previously converted  the notes will mature on march  net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately  after deducting the related offering expenses  of which approximately  was used to repurchase  shares of webmd common stock at a price of per share  the last reported sale price of webmd common stock on march   which repurchase settled on march  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing september  under the terms of the notes  as adjusted in april following completion of the tender offer  holders may surrender their notes for conversion into webmd common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per thousand dollars principal amount of the notes 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
in the aggregate  the notes are convertible into  shares of common stock following the april  adjustment 
auction rate securities 
effective april   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sold our holdings of auction rate securities which we refer to as ars  for an aggregate of  under the terms of the agreement  we retained an option which we refer to as the ars option  for a period of two years from the date of the agreement a to repurchase from the purchaser the same principal amount of any or all of the various series of ars sold  at the agreed upon purchase prices received on april   and b to receive from the purchaser additional proceeds upon certain redemptions of the various series of ars sold 
through the ars option  we received cash proceeds of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded pretax gains of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the ars option 
as of march   we no longer had any remaining positions related to the ars option and will receive no further cash proceeds 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal  primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and generally increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  many of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assets  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and website development costs  the carrying value of investments  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses  contingencies  litigation and related legal accruals and the value attributed to employee stock options and other stock based awards 
critical accounting policies we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  information services and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period that we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables that were entered into prior to january   revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on its relative fair value  which is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
in certain instances where fair value did not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements to the extent vsoe exists for the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value did not exist for the undelivered elements  the entire consideration is recognized over the period that the last element is delivered 
contracts that contain multiple deliverables that were entered into subsequent to january  are subject to accounting standards update no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu requires the allocation of revenue to each deliverable of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
it also changes the level of evidence of selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a company to make its best estimate of the selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
we adopted asu on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or subsequent to january  beginning january   pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on relative selling price 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our revenue recognition policies over the period that delivery occurs 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical pricing trends for specific products and services 
tpe is based on competitor prices of similar deliverables when sold separately 
we are generally not able to determine tpe of selling price as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors selling prices are for comparable services  combined with the fact that our services often contain unique features and customizations such that comparable services do not exist 
the determination of best estimate of selling price is a judgmental process that considers multiple factors including  but not limited to  recent selling prices and related discounting practices for each service  market conditions  customer classes  sales channels and other factors 
as a result of the adoption of asu  revenue for the year ended december  was higher by than the revenue that would have been recognized under the previous accounting standard 
this resulted from services that were provided or partially provided during the year ended december   for certain deliverables of our multiple deliverable arrangements for which we would have previously deferred the related revenue under the previous accounting standards 
during the year ended december   we assigned value to these deliverables using our best estimate of selling price  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements recognized revenue as they were delivered 
the multiple deliverable arrangements that were impacted by asu related to our public portal revenues and the services underlying such arrangements are generally delivered over periods of twelve months or less 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on fair value using exit price and market participant view  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level only when  after completing a qualitative analysis  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in fair value of investments in auction rate securities ars 
through april   we held investments in ars which were backed by student loans  guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of these ars holdings approximated par value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  substantially all auctions involving these securities have been unsuccessful 
effective april   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sold all of our holdings of ars for an aggregate of  under the terms of the agreement  we retained an option which we refer to as the ars option  for a period of two years from the date of the agreement a to repurchase from the purchaser the same principal amount of any or all of the various series of ars sold  at the agreed upon purchase prices received on april   and b to receive additional proceeds from the purchaser upon certain redemptions of the various series of ars sold 
since april   the ars option has been classified as a level asset as its valuation required substantial judgment 
the historical redemption activity of the specific ars underlying the ars option was the most significant assumption used to determine the estimated value of the ars option 
we were required to reassess the value of the ars option at each reporting period and changes in value were recorded within the statement of operations 
during  and  we recognized aggregate gains of   and  respectively  related to the ars option  and received cash proceeds of   and  during  and  respectively 
the value of the ars option as of december  was estimated to be  as of march   we no longer had any remaining positions related to the ars option 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding our ars option 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of the share based payment awards 
as of december   there was approximately  of unrecognized stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards held by employees  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years  related to our stock based compensation plans 
deferred taxes 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits 
these net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements significant portion of our net deferred tax assets  including the portion related to excess tax benefits of stock based awards  are reserved for by a valuation allowance as required by relevant accounting literature 
the remaining portion of our net deferred tax assets are no longer reserved for by a valuation allowance 
management determines the need for a valuation allowance by assessing the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
tax contingencies 
our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from applications of various statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable 
however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
consistent with our historical financial reporting  we have elected to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax benefit provision

table of contents 
index to financial statements explanatory note regarding adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed as supplemental to  and not as an alternative for  loss income from continuing operations or net loss income calculated in accordance with gaap 
our management uses adjusted ebitda as an additional measure of performance for purposes of business decision making  including developing budgets  managing expenditures  and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures 
period to period comparisons of adjusted ebitda help our management identify additional trends in financial results that may not be shown solely by period to period comparisons of loss income from continuing operations or net loss income 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by our management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions 
in addition  we believe that providing adjusted ebitda  together with a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to loss income from continuing operations or to net loss income  helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies that may have different capital structures  different effective income tax rates and tax attributes  different capitalized asset values and or different forms of employee compensation

our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  implementation of new or updated application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments and potential future acquisitions 
in addition  our ability to generate cash flow is subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic  regulatory and other matters affecting us and our customers

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the update simplifies how a company tests goodwill for impairment by allowing both public and nonpublic entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under that option  an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   which for us was the first quarter of the adoption of this amendment did not have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  entities have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
for public entities  the amendment was effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which for us was the first quarter of the adoption of this amendment resulted in a change to our presentation of comprehensive income  but otherwise had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to the existing guidance on fair value measurement 
the amendments are intended to create consistency between us generally accepted accounting standards and international financial reporting standards on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including i the application of the highest and best use valuation premise concepts  ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and iii quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level in addition  the amendments require additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
for public entities  the amendments were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us was the first quarter of these changes are required to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
