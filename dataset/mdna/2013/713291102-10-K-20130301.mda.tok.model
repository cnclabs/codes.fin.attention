risk factors the businesses of each reporting company are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of any one or more of the reporting companies  including  depending on the circumstances  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
unless otherwise noted  each risk factor set forth below applies to each reporting company 
phi s utility subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation which may significantly affect their operations 
phi s utility subsidiaries may be subject to fines  penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these requirements 
the regulated utilities that comprise power delivery are subject to extensive regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is regulated by the state agencies for each service territory in which it operates  with respect to  among other things  the manner in which utility service is provided to customers  as well as rates it can charge customers for the distribution and supply of electricity and  additionally for dpl  the distribution and supply of natural gas 
nerc has also established  and ferc has approved  reliability standards with regard to the bulk power system that impose certain operating  planning and cyber security requirements on pepco  dpl  ace and pepco energy services 
further  ferc regulates the electricity transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace 
approval of these regulators is required in connection with changes in rates and other aspects of the utilities operations 
these regulatory authorities  and nerc with respect to electric reliability  are empowered to impose financial penalties  fines and other sanctions against the utilities for non compliance with certain rules and regulations 
in this regard  in december  the mpsc sanctioned pepco related to its reliability in connection with major storm events that occurred in july and august these sanctions included imposing a fine on pepco and requiring pepco to file a work plan detailing  among other things  its reliability improvement objectives and progress in meeting those objectives  while raising the possibility of additional fines or cost recovery disallowances for failing to meet those objectives 
the mpsc also stated that it would consider in pepco s latest maryland retail base rate case the potential disallowance of the recovery of costs which may be determined to have been imprudently incurred 
in this base rate case  the mpsc set rates at a level that was not adequate to recover costs that pepco will incur during the period the rates are in effect 
nerc s eight regional oversight entities  including rfc  of which pepco  dpl  ace and pepco energy services are members  and npcc  of which pepco energy services is a member  are charged with the day to day implementation and enforcement of nerc s standards 
rfc and npcc perform compliance audits on entities registered with nerc based on reliability standards and criteria established by nerc 
nerc  rfc and npcc also conduct compliance investigations in response to a system disturbance  complaint  or possible violation of a reliability standard identified by other means 
pepco  dpl  ace and 
table of contents pepco energy services are subject to routine audits and monitoring with respect to compliance with applicable nerc reliability standards  including standards requested by ferc to increase the number of assets including cyber security assets subject to nerc cyber security standards that are designated as critical assets 
from time to time  pepco  dpl and ace have entered into settlement agreements with rfc resolving alleged violations and resulting in fines 
there can be no assurance that additional settlements resolving issues related to rfc or npcc requirements will not occur in the future 
the imposition of additional sanctions and civil fines by these enforcement entities could have a material adverse effect on a reporting company s results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
phi s utility subsidiaries  as well as pepco energy services  are also required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses 
although phi believes that each of its subsidiaries has  and each of pepco  dpl and ace believes it has  obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  phi is unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require any one or more of phi s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or significant capital expenditures or to change the way it conducts its operations 
phi s profitability is largely dependent on its ability to recover costs of providing utility services to its customers and to earn an adequate return on its capital investments 
the failure of phi to obtain timely recognition of costs in its rates may have a negative effect on phi s results of operations and financial condition 
the public service commissions which regulate phi s utility subsidiaries establish utility rates and tariffs intended to provide the utility the opportunity to obtain revenues sufficient to recover its prudently incurred costs  together with a reasonable return on investor supplied capital 
these regulatory authorities also determine how pepco  ace and dpl recover from their customers purchased power and natural gas and other operating costs  including transmission and other costs 
the utilities cannot change their rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will consider all costs to have been prudently incurred  nor can there be any assurance that the regulatory process by which rates are determined will always result in rates that achieve full and timely recovery of costs or a just and reasonable rate of return on investments 
in addition  if the costs incurred by any of the utilities in operating its business exceed the amounts on which its approved rates are based  the financial results of that utility  and correspondingly phi  may be adversely affected 
phi s utility subsidiaries are also exposed to regulatory lag  which refers to a shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates 
all of phi s utilities are currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because their investment in the rate base and their operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth 
phi anticipates that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
the failure to timely recognize costs in rates could have a material adverse effect on phi s and each utility subsidiary s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
in recent rate cases  pepco in the district of columbia and maryland  dpl in maryland and delaware and ace in new jersey have proposed mechanisms that would track reliability and other expenses and permit each utility to make adjustments in its approved rates to account for prudent investments as made  thereby seeking to reduce the magnitude of regulatory lag 
however  the mpsc and the dcpsc did not approve in substantial part requests by pepco in maryland and the district of columbia and dpl in maryland to implement regulatory lag mitigation mechanisms 
in delaware  a settlement agreement approved by the dpsc in dpl s electric distribution base rate case did not include these mechanisms  but it did provide that the parties will meet and discuss alternate regulatory methodologies for the mitigation of regulatory lag 
in new jersey  the njbpu has previously approved a similar mechanism  however  ace agreed as part of the settlement of its electric distribution base rate case to withdraw without 
table of contents prejudice its filing with the njbpu to extend and expand that previously approved mechanism 
there can be no assurance that any of the outstanding proposals or any other attempts by pepco  dpl and ace to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved  or that even if approved  the rate recovery mechanisms will fully mitigate the effects of regulatory lag 
if necessary to address in whole or in part the problem of regulatory lag  each utility can file and each utility presently intends to file base rate cases annually or even more frequently to seek to align its revenue and related cash flow levels allowed by the applicable public service commissions with operation and maintenance spending and capital investments 
the inability of phi s utility subsidiaries to obtain relief from the impact of regulatory lag through base rate cases or otherwise may have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition of phi and each utility subsidiary 
the operating results of power delivery and the retail energy supply business of pepco energy services fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
the power delivery business historically has been seasonal and  as a result  weather has had a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally higher in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  each of phi  pepco  dpl and ace historically has generated less revenue and income when temperatures are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer 
in addition  severe weather conditions can produce storms that cause extensive damage to the transmission and distribution systems  as well as related facilities  that can require the utilities to incur additional operation and maintenance expense  as well as capital expenditures 
these additional costs can be significant and the rates charged to customers may not always be timely or adequately adjusted to reflect these higher costs 
in the district of columbia and maryland  pepco and dpl are subject to a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism applicable to retail customers  which decouples distribution revenue for a given reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
the bill stabilization mechanism has the effect in those jurisdictions of reducing the impact of changes in the use of electricity by retail customers due to weather conditions or for other reasons on reported distribution revenue and income 
a comparable revenue decoupling mechanism for dpl electricity and natural gas customers in delaware is under consideration by the dpsc 
in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a bill stabilization adjustment or similar mechanism  operating results continue to be affected by weather conditions 
the retail energy supply business of pepco energy services  the wind down of which is expected to be completed at the latest in  generally produces higher gross margins when temperatures are colder than normal in winter or warmer than normal in summer  and less gross margin when weather conditions are milder than normal in the winter and cooler than normal in the summer 
the energy services business of pepco energy services  which includes providing energy savings performance contracting services principally to federal  state and local government customers  and designing  constructing and operating combined heat and power energy plants for customers  is not seasonal 
facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant capital or operation and maintenance expenditures  which could decrease revenues or increase expenses 
operation of the pepco  dpl and ace transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes  theft of copper wire or pipe  scams  failure of software or hardware  and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to provide reliable operations or to comply with changing environmental requirements 
thefts of copper wire or pipe  which seek to capitalize on the current high market price of copper  increase the likelihood of poor system voltage control  electricity and streetlight outages  damage to equipment and property  and injury or death  as well as increasing the likelihood of damage to fuel lines  which can create an unsafe and potentially explosive condition 
natural disasters and weather  
table of contents including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt transmission and distribution systems 
disruption of the operation of transmission or distribution facilities can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
phi is replacing customers existing electric and gas meters with an ami system 
in addition to the replacement of existing meters  the ami system involves the construction of a wireless network across the service territories of phi s utility subsidiaries and the implementation and integration of new and existing information technology systems to collect and manage data made available by the advanced meters 
the implementation of the ami system involves a combination of technologies provided by multiple vendors 
if the ami system results in lower than projected performance  phi s utility subsidiaries could experience higher than anticipated maintenance expenditures 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks  which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions 
utility companies  including phi s utility subsidiaries  have a large consumer customer base and as a result have been the subject of public criticism focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  public service commissions and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view energy companies such as phi and its subsidiaries in a favorable light  and may cause phi and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight 
unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing phi s operations  such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements  as well as fines  penalties or other sanctions or requirements 
the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on phi s and each utility subsidiary s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
unfavorable regulatory developments and compliance with new or enhanced regulatory requirements will subject phi s utility subsidiaries to higher operating costs 
phi s utility subsidiaries are subject to and will continue to be subject to changing regulatory requirements  including those related to reliability and customer service  in the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
for example  the mpsc has adopted new rules which became effective in may  establishing reliability and customer service regulations 
furthermore  in its most recent electric distribution base rate case filing  pepco has proposed subject to mpsc review and approval a reliability performance based mechanism that would allow pepco to earn up to million as an incentive for meeting enhanced reliability goals in  but provides a credit to customers of up to million in total if pepco does not meet at least the minimum targets 
in addition  in july  the dcpsc adopted regulations that establish specific maximum outage frequency and outage duration levels beginning in and continuing through and thereafter and are intended to require pepco to achieve a reliability level in the first quartile of all utilities in the nation by pepco believes that the dcpsc s standards are achievable in the short term  but believes that the standards may not be realistically achievable at an acceptable cost over the longer term 
the reliability standards permit pepco to petition the dcpsc to reevaluate these standards for the period from to to address feasibility and cost issues 
each of pepco and dpl expect that it will have to incur significant operating and maintenance and capital expenses to comply with these requirements 
furthermore  each of pepco and dpl would be subject to civil penalties or other sanctions if it does not meet the required performance or reliability standards 
other jurisdictions in which phi s utility subsidiaries have operations have reliability and customer service 
table of contents quality standards  the violation of which could also result in the imposition of penalties  fines and other sanctions 
compliance  and any failure to comply  with current  proposed or future regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on phi and each utility subsidiary s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
a recent case law decision involving lease transactions could impact our ongoing litigation against the irs involving certain cross border energy lease investments  could cause us to seek to unwind those lease investments  which may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
phi only pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments involving public utility assets located outside of the united states  which as of december   had a net investment value of approximately billion and from which phi currently derives approximately million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions in excess of rental income 
phi s cross border energy lease investments  each of which is with a tax indifferent party  have been under examination by the irs as part of normal phi federal income tax audits 
in connection with the audits of phi s federal income tax returns from to  the irs disallowed the depreciation and interest deductions in excess of rental income claimed by phi with respect to its cross border energy lease investments 
in addition  the irs has sought to recharacterize the leases as loan transactions 
phi commenced litigation in the us court of federal claims in january to review certain tax benefits claimed by phi on its federal tax returns for and on january   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit issued an opinion in consolidated edison company of new york  inc subsidiaries v 
united states to which phi is not a party that disallowed tax benefits associated with a lease in  lease out transaction 
under applicable accounting standards  the financial statement recognition of the tax benefits of phi s uncertain tax position associated with the cross border energy lease investments is permitted only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained 
further  the carrying value of the cross border energy lease investments must be recalculated if there is a change or a projected change in the timing of the estimated tax benefits generated from these investments 
after analyzing the consolidated edison ruling  phi has determined that its tax position with respect to the tax benefits associated with the cross border energy leases no longer meets the more likely than not standard of recognition for accounting purposes 
accordingly  phi expects to record a non cash charge of between million and million after tax in the first quarter of  consisting of a charge to reduce the carrying value of the cross border energy lease investments and a charge to reflect the anticipated additional interest expense related to changes in its estimated federal and state income tax obligations for the period over which the tax benefits may be disallowed 
after accounting for certain tax benefits arising from matters unrelated to these lease investments  phi estimates that it would be obligated to pay between million and million in additional federal and state taxes and between million and million of interest on the additional federal and state taxes as of march  while phi presently believes that it is more likely than not that no penalty will be incurred  the irs could require phi to pay a penalty of up to of the amount of additional taxes due 
phi continues to weigh its options with respect to its litigation with the irs 
phi is also evaluating the liquidation of all or a portion of its remaining cross border energy lease investments 
while phi estimates that a complete liquidation could be accomplished within one year  the liquidation of any of the lease investments would generally require the consent of the counterparty to that lease investment  and negotiations with the respective lessee or a purchaser of the lease investment may take longer than anticipated 
phi is unable to presently estimate the amount of proceeds that would be realized upon the liquidation of the lease portfolio in whole or in part 
furthermore  even if phi is able to successfully liquidate a lease investment  it may incur losses and additional earnings charges if the net proceeds from such liquidation were less than the then carrying value of the liquidated lease investment 
as a result of these and other uncertainties  the aggregate financial impact of a partial or complete liquidation of the lease investments by phi cannot be presently determined at this time  but phi believes that any such impact on phi s consolidated results of operations and financial condition may be material 

table of contents the transmission facilities of power delivery are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners 
failures of neighboring transmission systems could have a negative impact on power delivery s operations 
the electricity transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace are interconnected with the transmission facilities of neighboring utilities and are part of the interstate power transmission grid 
pepco  dpl and ace are members of the pjm rto  a regional transmission organization that operates the portion of the interstate transmission grid that includes the phi transmission facilities 
although pjm s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities  there can be no assurance that service interruptions originating at other utilities will not cause interruptions in the pepco  dpl or ace service territories 
thus  due to the interconnected nature of the grid  an outage in a neighboring utility could trigger a system outage in either pepco  dpl or ace 
if pepco  dpl or ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its and phi s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
changes in technology and conservation measures may adversely affect power delivery 
increased conservation and end user generation made possible through advances in technology could reduce demand for the transmission and distribution facilities of power delivery and adversely affect phi and one or more of its utility subsidiaries 
alternative technologies to produce electricity  the development of which has expanded due to climate change and other environmental concerns  could ultimately provide alternative sources of electricity 
as these new technologies are developed and become available  the quantity and pattern of electricity usage by customers could decline  which could have a negative impact on the business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition of phi or its utility subsidiaries 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and implementation of new and existing environmental laws may increase operating costs 
the operations of phi s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resource protection  site remediation and health and safety 
these laws and regulations may require significant capital and other expenditures to  among other things  meet emissions and effluent standards  conduct site remediation  complete environmental studies and perform environmental monitoring 
if a company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to achieve compliance 
in addition  phi s subsidiaries are required to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval  or if there is a failure to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
failure to retain and attract key skilled and properly motivated professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on operations 
phi and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated systems and technology 
one of the challenges they face in implementing their business strategy is to attract  motivate and retain a skilled  efficient and cost effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to retirements 
over the course of the next three years  phi estimates that approximately one third of this skilled workforce will reach retirement age 
competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees  especially as existing skilled workers retire in the near future  could adversely affect the business  operations and financial condition of phi or the affected company 

table of contents phi s subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could impact their business and operations 
as of december   of employees of phi and its subsidiaries  collectively  were represented by various labor unions 
phi s subsidiaries are parties to five collective bargaining agreements with four local unions that represent these employees 
collective bargaining agreements are generally renegotiated every three to five years  and the risk exists that there could be a work stoppage after expiration of an agreement until a new collective bargaining agreement has been reached 
labor negotiations typically involve bargaining over wages  benefits and working conditions  including management rights 
phi s last work stoppage  a two week strike by dpl s employees  occurred in during that strike  dpl used management and contractor employees to maintain essential operations 
one of the collective bargaining agreements to which phi s subsidiaries are a party was set to expire on february  and a second agreement will expire on june  the parties amended the agreement that was to expire in february to extend its expiration date  which is now currently march  further extensions of this expiration date may be possible 
though phi believes that a protracted work stoppage is unlikely  such an event could result in a disruption of the operations of the affected utility  which could  in turn  have a material adverse effect upon the business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition of the affected utility and phi 
the energy services business of pepco energy services is highly competitive and is exposed to customer concentration 
phi only unlike phi s regulated business  pepco energy services business is highly competitive and is not assured a rate of return on capital investments through a predetermined rate structure 
this competition puts downward pressure on margins and increases costs 
the energy services business is impacted by new entrants into the market  energy prices  and general economic conditions 
these factors may negatively impact pepco energy services ability to market its services to new customers  or renew existing contracts  as well as the prices pepco energy services may charge 
among the factors on which the energy services business competes are the amount and duration of the guarantees provided in energy savings performance contracts 
in connection with many of its energy savings performance installation projects  pepco energy services guarantees a minimum level of annual energy cost savings over a period typically up to years 
currently  pepco energy services does not insure against this risk  and accordingly could suffer financial losses if a project does not achieve the guaranteed level of performance 
under the budget control act of  mandatory federal spending cuts  or sequestration  becomes effective for years through unless congress agrees to a deficit reduction plan 
in january  congress passed  and the president signed  the american taxpayer relief act of that addressed rising federal income tax rates that would have taken effect on january  the american taxpayer relief act of does not address spending issues or sequestration issues that congress intends to address later in substantial federal spending cuts could make it more difficult for pepco energy services to enter into new energy services performance contracts with federal  state and local government agencies and thus could have a material adverse effect on the energy savings performance services business of pepco energy services 
in addition  revenues associated with pepco energy services combined heat and power generating plant in atlantic city  new jersey are concentrated with a few major customers in the hotel and casino industry 
pepco energy services has long term contracts with these customers  and for the largest customer  the contracts expire in pepco energy services is exposed to the risk that it is not able to renew these contracts or that the contract counterparties fail to perform  and in either case  pepco energy services results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents under its energy savings performance contracts  pepco energy services is responsible for maintaining  repairing and replacing energy equipment  which obligations may require pepco energy services to incur significant costs many years after an installation of a project is completed 
phi only pepco energy services owns energy equipment and is also responsible for operating and maintaining additional energy equipment that it does not own 
in addition  it is generally pepco energy services responsibility to repair or replace this energy equipment in the event of a failure 
these equipment maintenance  repair and replacement obligations could adversely affect phi s results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
the inability of pepco energy services to perform its obligations in connection with its energy services construction projects may have a material adverse effect on phi 
phi only projects undertaken by pepco energy services include design  construction  startup and testing activities related to combined heat and power and other energy facilities  pursuant to guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts 
pepco energy services will generally secure commitments from subcontractors and vendors to perform within contract pricing commitments  equipment performance standards  jobsite safety requirements  and other key parameters 
ultimately  however  pepco energy services will bear responsibility in the event of unexcused failures by these subcontractors and vendors  as well as other third parties  to perform in accordance with the terms of these contracts or otherwise pursuant to the expectations of the parties 
when such events occur  pepco energy services may experience reputational harm and claims for money damages and other relief  which could  depending upon the cause and severity of the failure of performance  adversely affect phi s business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
if phi is not successful in mitigating the risks inherent in its business  its operations could be adversely affected 
phi and its subsidiaries are faced with a number of different types of risk 
phi confronts legislative  regulatory policy  compliance and other risks  including our inability to timely recover capital and operating costs  which may result in a shortfall in revenues  resource planning and other long term planning risks  including resource acquisition risks  which may hinder our ability to maintain adequate resources  financial risks  including credit  interest rate and capital market risks  which could increase the cost of capital or make raising capital more difficult  and macroeconomic risks  including risks related to economic conditions and changes in demand for electricity and natural gas in the service territories of phi s utility subsidiaries  as well as with respect to pepco energy services business  which could negatively impact the operations of the affected business 
phi management seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in the implementation of phi s business strategy through its established risk mitigation process  which includes adherence to phi s business policies and other compliance policies  operation of formal risk management structures and groups  and overall business management 
phi management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing risks  and developing risk management strategies  while the board of directors and its various committees oversee the assessment  management and mitigation of risk 
however  there can be no assurance these risk mitigation efforts will adequately address all such risks or that such efforts will be successful 
phi and its subsidiaries are exposed to contractual and credit risks associated with certain of their operations 
phi and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of contractual and credit risks associated with certain of their operations 
for example  pepco energy services has entered into commercial transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas  as well as derivative and other transactions to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
under these arrangements  pepco energy services is exposed to the 
table of contents risk that the counterparty may fail to perform its obligation to make or take delivery under the contract  fail to make a required payment or fail to return collateral posted by pepco energy services when the counterparty is required to do so 
in addition  phi s pci subsidiary has entered into several cross border energy lease investments located outside the united states 
under these leases  pci is exposed to the risk that the counterparty may fail to make lease payments on time or at all 
many of these contracts provide for phi or a subsidiary to receive collateral or other types of performance assurance from the counterparty  which may be in the form of cash  letters of credit or parent guarantees  to protect against performance and credit risk 
even where collateral is provided  capital market disruptions can prevent the counterparty from meeting its collateral obligations or degrade the value of letters of credit and guarantees as a result of the lowered rating or insolvency of the issuer or guarantor 
in the event of a bankruptcy of a counterparty to any contract to which phi or any of its subsidiaries is a party  bankruptcy law  in some circumstances  could require the surrender of collateral held or payments received 
in the case of pci  the fact that the counterparties are located outside the united states could make it more difficult for pci to seek redress or obtain a judgment or compensation against a foreign counterparty for any breach of the lease agreement by that counterparty 
business operations could be adversely affected by terrorism and cyber attacks 
the threat of  or actual acts of  terrorism may affect the operations of phi and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force an increase in security measures and cause electrical disruptions or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  including natural gas 
utility industry operations require the continued deployment and utilization of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
while phi has implemented protective measures designed to mitigate its vulnerability to physical and cyber threats and attacks  such protective measures  and technology systems generally  are vulnerable to disability or failure due to cyber attack  acts of war or terrorism  and other causes 
as a result  there can be no assurance that such protective measures will be completely effective in protecting phi s infrastructure or assets from a physical or cyber attack or the effects thereof 
if any of pepco s  dpl s or ace s infrastructure facilities  including their transmission or distribution facilities  were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  the operations of phi  pepco  dpl or ace could be adversely affected 
furthermore  any threats or actions that negatively impact the physical security of phi s and its subsidiaries facilities  or the integrity or security of their computer networks and systems and any programs or data stored thereon or therein  could adversely affect phi s and its subsidiaries ability to manage these facilities  networks  systems  programs and data efficiently or effectively  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on phi s or its subsidiaries results of operations and financial condition 
corresponding instability in the financial markets as a result of threats or acts of terrorism or threatened or actual cyber attacks also could adversely affect the ability of phi or its subsidiaries to raise needed capital 
mark to market accounting treatment for instruments pepco energy services uses to hedge the cost of supply used to satisfy retail customer load obligations could cause earnings volatility 
phi only pepco energy services purchases energy commodity contracts in the form of electricity and natural gas futures  swaps  options and forward contracts to hedge commodity price risk in connection with the purchase of natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers 
certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions or do not meet the requirements for normal purchase and normal sale accounting are marked to market through current earnings 
any change in the fair value of the transactions used to hedge price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting and receive mark to market accounting treatment will be reflected in phi s current earnings without any offsetting change in the fair value of its retail load obligations until the settlement date of these contracts in future periods 
pepco energy services has discontinued hedge accounting  so phi s earnings could be more volatile due to the mark to market accounting treatment associated with these commodity contracts 
as of december   the commodity contracts that currently qualify for normal purchase and normal sale accounting and an exception from mark to market accounting are in a significant net loss position on a 
table of contents fair value basis 
if phi could no longer sustain the normal purchase and normal sale designation for these contracts  it would be required to recognize these net losses and future changes in the fair value in earnings  which could result in greater earnings volatility 
it is anticipated that the notional value and the fair value of the supply contracts will decrease considerably during with the wind down of the retail energy business 
new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how a reporting company reports its results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
each reporting company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  the fasb or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require the reporting companies to change their accounting policies 
these changes are beyond the control of the reporting companies  can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how they report their results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
each reporting company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  which could adversely affect its results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 
each reporting company s internal controls  accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable the reporting company to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap  laws and regulations  taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations applicable to it 
such compliance permits each reporting company to  among other things  disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of its costs and with the reporting requirements for each reporting company under federal securities  tax and other laws and regulations 
each reporting company has implemented corporate governance  internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act and relevant sec rules  as well as other applicable regulations 
such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by each reporting company s management and phi s board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws  rules and regulations 
management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls 
while phi believes these controls  policies  practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity  unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting 
the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the affected reporting company 
the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect the ability of a reporting company to access the capital markets 
insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty or property losses that the companies might incur 
phi and its subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds received  if any  will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 

table of contents phi and its subsidiaries are dependent on obtaining access to capital markets and bank financing to satisfy their capital and liquidity requirements 
the inability to obtain required financing would have an adverse effect on their respective businesses 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace each have significant capital requirements  including the funding of construction expenditures and the refinancing of maturing debt 
these companies rely primarily on cash flow from operations and access to the capital markets to meet these financing needs 
the operating activities of phi and its subsidiaries also require access to short term money markets and bank financing as sources of liquidity that are not met by cash flow from their operations 
adverse business developments or market disruptions could increase the cost of financing or prevent phi or any of its subsidiaries from accessing one or more financial markets 
events that could cause or contribute to a disruption of the financial markets include  but are not limited to a recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies or financial institutions  a significant change in energy prices  a terrorist or cyber attack or threatened attacks  the outbreak of a pandemic or other similar event  or a significant electricity or natural gas transmission disruption 
any reductions in or other actions with respect to the credit ratings of phi or any of its subsidiaries could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships 
nationally recognized rating agencies currently rate phi  pepco  dpl and ace  and debt securities issued by pepco  dpl and ace 
ratings are not recommendations to buy or sell securities 
phi or its subsidiaries may  in the future  incur new indebtedness with interest rates that may be affected by changes in or other actions associated with these credit ratings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically  and previous ratings may not be maintained in the future 
rating agencies may also place phi  pepco  dpl or ace under review for potential downgrade in certain circumstances or if any of them seek to take certain actions 
a downgrade of these debt ratings or other negative action  such as a review for a potential downgrade  could affect the market price of existing indebtedness and the ability to raise additional debt without incurring increases in the cost of capital 
in addition  a downgrade of these ratings  or other negative action  could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations  to support business growth and to maintain or improve the current financial strength of phi s business and operations 
the collateral requirements of pepco energy services retail energy supply business also are determined in part by the unsecured debt rating of phi 
negative ratings actions by one or more of the credit rating agencies resulting from a change in phi s or the utility s operating results or prospects would increase funding costs 
any increases in collateral requirements could make such contractual obligations more expensive and make financing more difficult to obtain 
the agreements that govern phi s primary credit facility and its term loan agreement contain a consolidated indebtedness covenant that may limit discretion of each borrower to incur indebtedness or reduce its equity 
under the terms of phi s primary credit facility  of which each reporting company is a borrower  and of phi s term loan agreement entered into in april  the consolidated indebtedness of a borrower cannot exceed of its consolidated capitalization 
if a borrower s equity were to decline or its debt were to increase to a level that caused its debt to exceed this limit  lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable 
to avoid such a default  a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required  which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict the affected reporting company s operational and financing flexibility 

table of contents each borrower s ability to comply with this covenant is subject to various risks and uncertainties  including events beyond the borrower s control 
for example  events that could cause a reduction in phi s equity include  without limitation  a further write down of phi s cross border energy lease investments or a significant write down of phi s goodwill 
even if each borrower is able to comply with this covenant  the restrictions on its ability to operate its business in its sole discretion could harm its and phi s business by  among other things  limiting the borrower s ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that it may believe would be in its best interests or the interests of phi s stockholders to complete 
phi s cash flow  ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its regulated and competitive operating subsidiaries  access to capital markets and other sources of liquidity 
phi s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of its subsidiaries 
phi only phi is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its regulated and competitive subsidiaries  and all of phi s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  phi s cash flow  its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries  each reporting company s access to capital markets and all sources of cash flow and liquidity that may be available to phi 
phi s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by phi or to make any funds available for such payment 
the ability of phi s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to phi may be restricted by  among other things  applicable corporate  tax and other laws and regulations and agreements made by phi and its subsidiaries  including under the terms of indebtedness  and phi s financial objective of maintaining a common equity ratio at its utility subsidiaries of between and 
because the claims of the creditors of phi s subsidiaries are superior to phi s entitlement to dividends  the unsecured debt and obligations of phi are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries  including trade creditors 
in addition  claims of creditors  including trade creditors  of phi s subsidiaries will generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over the claims of phi s creditors 
phi has a significant goodwill balance related to its power delivery business 
a determination that goodwill is impaired could result in a significant non cash charge to earnings 
phi had a goodwill balance at december   of approximately billion  primarily attributable to pepco s acquisition of conectiv in an impairment charge must be recorded under gaap to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  as shown on the consolidated balance sheet 
phi is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that may result in an interim impairment test include a decline in phi s stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value  an adverse change in business conditions or an adverse regulatory action 
if phi were to determine that its goodwill is impaired  phi would be required to reduce its goodwill balance by the amount of the impairment and record a corresponding non cash charge to earnings 
depending on the amount of the impairment  an impairment determination could have a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition and results of operations  but would not have an impact on cash flow 

table of contents the funding of future defined benefit pension plan and post retirement benefit plan obligations is based on assumptions regarding the valuation of future benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
if market performance decreases plan assets or changes in assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations increase plan liabilities  any of the reporting companies may be required to make significant cash contributions to fund these plans 
phi holds assets in trust to meet its obligations under phi s defined benefit pension plan and its post retirement benefit plan 
the amounts that phi is required to contribute including the amounts for which pepco  dpl and ace are responsible to fund the trusts are determined based on assumptions made as to the valuation of future benefit obligations  and the investment performance of the plan assets 
accordingly  the performance of the capital markets will affect the value of plan assets 
a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the plan funding requirements to meet the future benefit obligations 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the valuation of the liabilities of the plans 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially requiring additional funding 
demographic changes  such as a change in the expected timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  also may increase the funding requirements of the plans 
a need for significant additional funding of the plans could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows of any of the reporting companies 
future increases in pension plan and other post retirement benefit plan costs  to the extent they are not recoverable in the base rates of phi s utility subsidiaries  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  cash flow and financial condition of any of the reporting companies 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law and in phi s constituent documents may discourage an acquisition of phi 
phi only phi is governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibit a public delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder as defined in section for a period commencing three years from the date in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the board of directors approved the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of the voting stock of the corporation excluding shares owned by officers  directors  or certain employee stock purchase plans  or at or subsequent to the time the transaction is approved by the board of directors  there is an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder approving the transaction 
section could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover attempts against phi  and accordingly  may discourage or prevent attempts to acquire or control phi through a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  phi s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring phi  even if doing so would be beneficial to its stockholders 
under phi s restated certificate of incorporation  only its board of directors may call special meetings of stockholders 
further  stockholder actions may only be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent 
moreover  directors of phi may be removed by stockholders only for cause and only by the effective vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of phi entitled to vote generally in the election of directors voting together as a single class at a meeting of stockholders called for that purpose 
in addition  under phi s amended and restated bylaws  stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to phi s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and this provision may be amended or repealed by stockholders only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares of phi capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  voting together as a single class 

table of contents issuances of additional series of phi preferred stock could adversely affect holders of phi s common stock 
phi only phi s board of directors is authorized to issue shares of phi preferred stock in series without any action on the part of phi stockholders 
phi s board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock  including with respect to dividend rights  redemption rights and sinking fund provisions  conversion rights  voting rights  and other preferential rights  limitations and restrictions 
if phi issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over phi s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if preferred stock is issued with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of phi s common stock or the market price of such common stock could be adversely affected 
furthermore  issuances of preferred stock can be used to discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring phi where the acquisition might be perceived as being beneficial to stockholders 
because pepco  dpl and ace are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of phi and have directors and executive officers who are also officers of phi  phi can effectively exercise control over their dividend policies and significant business and financial transactions 
pepco  dpl and ace only all of the members of each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors  as well as many of their respective executive officers  are officers of phi  and pepco  dpl and ace are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of phi 
among other decisions  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  and subject to the financial covenants under each company s respective outstanding debt instruments  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on its capital structure  which is based in part on earnings and cash flow  and also may take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

table of contents pepco holdings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc general overview phi  a delaware corporation incorporated in  is a holding company that  through its regulated public utility subsidiaries  is engaged primarily in the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity and the distribution and supply of natural gas power delivery 
through pepco energy services  phi provides energy savings performance contracting services  high voltage underground transmission cabling  construction and operations of combined heat and power and central energy plants and is in the process of winding down its competitive electricity and natural gas retail supply business 
each of power delivery and pepco energy services constitutes a separate segment for financial reporting purposes 
a third segment  other non regulated  consists of a portfolio of cross border energy lease investments 
the following table sets forth the percentage contributions to consolidated operating revenue and operating income from continuing operations attributable to phi segments december  percentage of consolidated operating revenue power delivery pepco energy services other a percentage of consolidated operating income power delivery pepco energy services other a b percentage of power delivery operating revenue power delivery electric power delivery gas a for presentation purposes  this category includes other non regulated and corporate and other 
b includes gains on early termination of finance leases held in trust that represent of the consolidated operating income in and power delivery power delivery electric consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity  and power delivery gas consists of the delivery and supply of natural gas 
power delivery represents a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
each utility comprising power delivery is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each utility is responsible for the distribution of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission in each jurisdiction 
each utility also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service is sos in delaware  the district of columbia and maryland  and bgs in new jersey 
in this report  these supply service obligations are referred to generally as default electricity supply 

table of contents pepco holdings each of pepco  dpl and ace is responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across its service territory 
the rates each utility is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by ferc 
transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc approved formula methodology 
the profitability of power delivery depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
operating results also can be affected by economic conditions  energy prices  the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity and weather 
power delivery s results historically have been seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
for retail customers of pepco and dpl in maryland and of pepco in the district of columbia  revenue is not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bsa for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer rather than a charge based upon energy usage 
the bsa has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a result  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
a comparable revenue decoupling mechanism for dpl electricity and natural gas customers in delaware is under consideration by the dpsc 
in accounting for the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment an adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from distribution sales differs from the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer is recorded representing either i a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or ii a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco and dpl are entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
since  phi has implemented comprehensive reliability enhancement plans which include various initiatives to improve electrical system reliability  including the identification and upgrading of under performing feeder lines  the addition of new facilities to support load  the installation of distribution automation systems on both the overhead and underground network systems  the rejuvenation and replacement of underground residential cables  selective undergrounding of portions of existing above ground primary feeder lines  where appropriate to improve reliability  improvements to substation supply lines  and enhanced vegetation management 
phi s capital expenditures for continuing reliability enhancement efforts are included in the table of projected capital expenditures within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity capital requirements capital expenditures 

table of contents pepco holdings power delivery initiatives and activities smart grid phi is building a smart grid which is designed to meet the challenges of rising energy costs  concerns about the environment  reliability improvement  providing timely and accurate customer information and meeting government energy reduction goals 
the installation of smart meters is subject to the approval of applicable state regulators 
the dcpsc  mpsc and dpsc have approved the creation of regulatory assets to defer ami costs between rate cases  as well as the accrual of returns on the deferred costs 
thus  these costs will be recovered in the future through base rates 
approval of ami has been deferred by the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu for ace in new jersey 
in april  phi signed agreements to formalize million in awards from the us department of energy to support the rollout of smart grid initiatives 
in the pepco service area  million was awarded for ami  direct load control  distribution automation and communications infrastructure  while in the atlantic city electric service area  million was awarded for direct load control  distribution automation and communications infrastructure 
the grants effectively reduce the project costs of these initiatives 
the cumulative award payments received by pepco and ace as of december   were million and million  respectively 
for projected through capital expenditures associated with the smart grid  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity capital requirements 
regulatory lag an important factor in the ability of each of pepco  dpl and ace to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of applicable public service commissions to adequately recognize forward looking costs in the utility s rate structure in order to address the shortfall in revenues due to the delay in time or lag between when costs are incurred and when they are reflected in rates 
this delay is commonly known as regulatory lag 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because its investment in the rate base and its operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth 
in an effort to minimize the effects of regulatory lag  pepco s and dpl s delaware  district of columbia and maryland base rate case filings in each included a request for approval from the applicable state regulatory commissions of i a reliability investment recovery mechanism rim to recover reliability related capital expenditures incurred between base rate cases and ii the use by the applicable utility of fully forecasted test years in future base rate cases 
see note  regulatory matters rate proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements of phi for a discussion of each of these mechanisms 
in both the pepco and dpl base rate case orders in maryland  the mpsc did not approve pepco s and dpl s requests to implement the rim and did not endorse the use by pepco and dpl of fully forecasted test years in future rate cases 
however  the mpsc did permit an adjustment to the rate base of pepco and dpl to reflect the actual cost of reliability plant additions outside the test year 
in the district of columbia  the dcpsc denied pepco s request for approval of a rim  and reserved final judgment on the appropriateness of the use by pepco of a fully forecasted test year in future rate cases 
in delaware  a settlement agreement approved by the dpsc in dpl s electric distribution base rate case did not include approval of a rim or the use of fully forecasted test years in future dpl rate cases  but it did provide that the parties will meet and discuss alternate regulatory methodologies for the mitigation of regulatory lag 
each of phi s utility subsidiaries will continue to seek cost recovery from applicable public service commissions to reduce the effects of regulatory lag 
there can be no assurance that any attempts by phi s utility subsidiaries to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved  or that even if approved  the cost recovery mechanisms will fully mitigate the effects of regulatory lag 
until such time as any cost recovery mechanisms are approved  phi s utility subsidiaries plan to file rate cases at least annually in an effort to align more closely the revenue and cash flow levels of phi s utility subsidiaries with other operation and maintenance spending and capital investments

table of contents pepco holdings pepco energy services since  pepco energy services has been focused on growing its energy savings performance contracting services business in the federal  state and local government markets 
activity in the state and local government markets  which are pepco energy services largest markets  slowed significantly in  due to  among other factors  lower energy prices that have lessened the economic benefits of energy savings projects and the reluctance of state and local governments to incur new debt associated with these projects 
as a result of the slowdown  pepco energy services believes that new business in these markets will remain challenged for the foreseeable future 
consequently  pepco energy services reduced resources and personnel and limited geographic expansion in the energy savings services business  and has refocused its existing resources on developing business in the federal government market and continuing to pursue combined heat and power projects 
phi guarantees the obligations of pepco energy services under certain of its energy savings performance  combined heat and power and construction contracts

table of contents pepco holdings income tax expense phi s consolidated effective tax rates from continuing operations for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of certain tax benefits in that did not recur in and phi s early termination of its interest in certain cross border energy leases in in  certain phi subsidiaries were restructured which subjected phi to state income taxes in new jurisdictions and resulted in current state tax benefits that were recorded in and did not recur in specifically  on april   as part of an ongoing effort to simplify phi s organizational structure  certain of phi s subsidiaries were converted from corporations to single member limited liability companies 
in addition to increased organizational flexibility and reduced administrative costs  converting these entities to limited liability companies allows phi to include income or losses in the former corporations in a single state income tax return  thus increasing the utilization of state income tax attributes 
as a result of inclusions of income or losses in a single state return as discussed above  phi recorded an million benefit by reversing a valuation allowance on certain state net operating losses and an additional benefit of million resulting from changes to certain state deferred tax benefits 
in addition  in november  phi reached final settlement with the irs with respect to its federal tax returns for the years to for all issues except its cross border energy lease investments

at december   phi s current assets on a consolidated basis totaled billion and its current liabilities totaled billion  for a working capital deficit of million 
the increase of million in the working capital deficit from december  to december  was primarily due to an increase in long term debt that will mature within one year and an increase in short term debt for phi  pepco and ace to temporarily support higher spending by the utilities on infrastructure investments and reliability initiatives

table of contents pepco holdings equity forward transaction during  phi entered into an equity forward transaction in connection with a public offering of  shares of phi common stock 
the use of an equity forward transaction substantially eliminates future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions  while mitigating immediate share dilution resulting from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until funds are needed in accordance with phi s capital investment and regulatory plans 
pursuant to the terms of this transaction  a forward counterparty borrowed  shares of phi s common stock from third parties and sold them to a group of underwriters for per share  less an underwriting discount equal to per share 
the equity forward transaction had no initial fair value since it was entered into at the then market price of the common stock 
phi did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the equity forward transaction was settled  and at that time phi recorded the proceeds in equity 
phi concluded that the equity forward transaction was an equity instrument based on the accounting guidance in asc and asc  and that it qualified for an exception from derivative accounting under asc because the forward sale transaction was indexed to its own stock 
as allowed by the terms of the transaction  phi physically settled the equity forward transaction on february  by issuing  shares of common stock at per share to the forward counterparty 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down outstanding commercial paper  a portion of which was issued in order to make capital contributions to the utilities  and for general corporate purposes 
during  the equity forward transaction was reflected in phi s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method 
under this method  the number of shares of phi s common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share for a reporting period would be increased by the number of shares  if any  that would be issued upon physical settlement of the equity forward transaction less the number of shares that could be purchased by phi in the market based on the average market price during that reporting period using the proceeds receivable upon settlement of the equity forward transaction based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of that reporting period 
the excess number of shares is weighted for the portion of the reporting period in which the equity forward transaction is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the equity forward transaction had a dilutive effect of on phi s earnings per share

table of contents pepco holdings contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of phi or the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   a downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of phi and each of its rated subsidiaries to below investment grade would increase the collateral obligation of phi and its subsidiaries by up to million 
of this amount  million is attributable to derivatives  normal purchase and normal sale contracts  collateral  and other contracts under master netting agreements as described in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi 
the remaining million is attributable primarily to energy services contracts and accounts payable to independent system operators and distribution companies on full requirements contracts entered into by pepco energy services 
phi believes that it and its subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and default electricity supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements

table of contents pepco holdings sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  dividends  and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  issuances by phi  pepco  dpl and ace under their commercial paper programs  securities issuances  short term loans  and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect access to certain of phi s potential funding sources 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
cash flow from operations cash flow generated by regulated utility subsidiaries in power delivery is the primary source of phi s cash flow from operations 
additional cash flows are generated by the business of pepco energy services and from the occasional sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank term loans and lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace maintain ongoing commercial paper programs to address short term liquidity needs 
as of december   the maximum capacity available under these programs was million  million  million and million  respectively  subject to available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
during  phi entered into a million term loan agreement pursuant to which phi has borrowed and may not reborrow million 
proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities the issuance of debt securities by phi s principal subsidiaries requires the approval of either ferc or one or more state public utility commissions 
neither ferc approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by phi 
state financing authority pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the dcpsc and mpsc 
dpl s long term financing activities are subject to authorization by the mpsc and the dpsc 
ace s long term and short term consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less financing activities are subject to authorization by the njbpu 
each utility  through periodic filings with the state public service commission s having jurisdiction over its financing activities  has maintained standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 

table of contents pepco holdings ferc financing authority under the federal power act fpa  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by pepco and dpl 
pepco and dpl have obtained ferc authority for the issuance of short term debt 
because pepco energy services also qualifies as a public utility under the fpa and is not regulated by a state utility commission  ferc also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by pepco energy services 
pepco energy services has obtained the requisite ferc financing authority in its market based rate orders 
money pool pepco holdings operates a system money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by ferc 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
regulatory and other matters rate proceedings distribution the rates that each of pepco  dpl and ace is permitted to charge for the retail distribution of electricity and natural gas to its various classes of customers are based on the principle that the utility is entitled to generate an amount of revenue sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service  including a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital 
these base rates are intended to cover all of each utility s reasonable and prudent expenses of constructing  operating and maintaining its distribution facilities other than costs covered by specific cost recovery surcharges 
a change in base rates in a jurisdiction requires the approval of the public service commission 
in the rate application submitted to the public service commission  the utility specifies an increase in its revenue requirement  which is the additional revenue that the utility is seeking authorization to earn 
the revenue requirement consists of i the allowable expenses incurred by the utility  including operation and maintenance expenses  taxes and depreciation  and ii the utility s cost of capital 
the compensation of the utility for its cost of capital takes the form of an overall rate of return allowed by the public service commission on the utility s distribution rate base to compensate the utility s investors for their debt and equity investments in the company 
the rate base is the aggregate value of the investment in property used by the utility in providing electricity and natural gas distribution services and generally consists of plant in service net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred taxes  plus cash working capital  material and operating supplies and  depending on the jurisdiction  construction work in progress 
over time  the rate base is increased by utility property additions and reduced by depreciation and property retirements and write offs 

table of contents pepco holdings in addition to its base rates  some of the costs of providing distribution service are recovered through the operation of surcharges 
examples of costs recovered by phi s utility subsidiaries through surcharges  which vary depending on the jurisdiction  include a surcharge to reimburse the utility for the cost of purchasing electricity from nugs new jersey  surcharges to reimburse the utility for costs of public interest programs for low income customers and for demand side management programs new jersey  maryland  delaware and the district of columbia  a surcharge to pay the transitional bond charge new jersey  surcharges to reimburse the utility for certain environmental costs delaware and maryland  and surcharges related to the bsa maryland and the district of columbia 
each utility subsidiary regularly reviews its distribution rates in each jurisdiction of its service territory  and files applications to adjust its rates as necessary in an effort to ensure that its revenues are sufficient to cover its operating expenses and its cost of capital 
the timing of future rate filings and the change in the distribution rate requested will depend on a number of factors  including changes in revenues and expenses and the incurrence or the planned incurrence of capital expenditures see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview power delivery initiatives and activities regulatory lag 
during  pepco  dpl and ace concluded electric distribution base rate cases filed during in their respective state regulatory jurisdictions 
in the fourth quarter of  pepco filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in maryland  ace filed an electric distribution base rate increase application in new jersey and dpl filed a natural gas distribution base rate case in delaware 
electric distribution base rate increase applications are expected to be filed in early by pepco in the district of columbia and by dpl in delaware and maryland 
in general  a request for new distribution rates is made on the basis of test year balances for rate base allowable operating expenses and a requested rate of return 
the test year amounts used in the filing may be historical or partially projected 
the public service commission may  however  select a different test period than that proposed by the applicable utility 
although the approved tariff rates are intended to be forward looking  and therefore provide for the recovery of some future changes in rate base and operating costs  they typically do not reflect all of the changes in costs for the period in which the new rates are in effect

table of contents pepco holdings transmission the rates pepco  dpl and ace are permitted to charge for the transmission of electricity are regulated by ferc and are based on each utility s transmission rate base  transmission operating expenses and an overall rate of return that is approved by ferc 
for each utility subsidiary  ferc has approved a formula for the calculation of the utility transmission rate  which is referred to as a formula rate 
the formula rates include both fixed and variable elements 
certain of the fixed elements  such as the return on equity and depreciation rates  can be changed only in a ferc rate proceeding 
the variable elements of the formula  including the utility s rate base and operating expenses  are updated annually  effective june of each year  with data from the utility s most recent annual ferc form filing 
in addition to its formula rate  each utility s return on equity is supplemented by incentive rates  sometimes referred to as adders  and other incentives  which are authorized by ferc to promote capital investment in transmission infrastructure 
return on equity adders are in effect for each of pepco  dpl and ace relating to specific transmission upgrades and improvements  as well as in consideration for each utility s continued membership in pjm 
as members of pjm  the transmission rates of pepco  dpl and ace are set out in pjm s open access transmission tariff

critical accounting policies general phi has identified the following accounting policies that result in having to make certain estimates that  as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
phi has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill impairment evaluation substantially all of phi s goodwill was generated by pepco s acquisition of conectiv in and is allocated entirely to the power delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under fasb guidance on goodwill and other intangibles asc 
management has identified power delivery as a single reporting unit because its components have similar economic characteristics  similar products and services and operate in a similar regulatory environment 
phi tests its goodwill impairment at least annually as of november and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors that may result in an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to a change in identified reporting units  an adverse change in business conditions  a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value  an adverse regulatory action  or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for power delivery when estimating the reporting unit s fair value 
in addition  phi selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows 
these judgments are 
table of contents pepco holdings inherently uncertain  and actual results could vary from those used in phi s estimates 
the impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test  which could materially impact the estimated fair value of power delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements 
phi s november  annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
see note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements of phi 
in order to estimate the fair value of the power delivery reporting unit  phi uses two valuation techniques an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using estimated future cash flows and a terminal value that is consistent with power delivery s long term view of the business 
this approach uses a discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital wacc for the reporting unit 
phi determines the estimated wacc by considering market based information for the cost of equity and cost of debt that is appropriate for power delivery as of the measurement date 
the market approach estimates fair value based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda that management believes is consistent with ebitda multiples for comparable utilities 
phi has consistently used this valuation framework to estimate the fair value of power delivery 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors that are sourced from the power delivery reporting unit s business forecast  including but not limited to interest rates  growth assumptions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditure requirements  and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience 
a hypothetical percent decrease in fair value of the power delivery reporting unit at november  would not have resulted in the power delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test  as defined in the guidance  as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been above its carrying value 
sensitive  interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the power delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance  sustained adverse business conditions  change in forecasted revenues  higher operating and maintenance capital expenditure requirements  a significant increase in the cost of capital  and other factors 
phi believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments  and the impact of a change in assumptions and estimates could be material to financial results 
long lived assets impairment evaluation phi believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about when events indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable and how to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in phi s estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on phi s assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the primary assets subject to a long lived asset impairment evaluation are property  plant  and equipment 
the fasb guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as i a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  including an adverse action or assessment by a 
table of contents pepco holdings regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  v a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  and vi a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  phi considers historical cash flows 
phi uses reasonable estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
if necessary  the process of determining fair value is performed consistently with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above 
accounting for derivatives phi believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because management exercises judgment in the following areas  any of which could have a material impact on its financial statements i the application of the definition of a derivative to contracts to identify derivatives  ii the election of the normal purchases and normal sales exception from derivative accounting  iii the application of cash flow hedge accounting  and iv the estimation of fair value used in the measurement of derivatives and hedged items  which are highly susceptible to changes in value over time due to market trends or  in certain circumstances  significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value that could result in actual results being materially different from phi s estimates 
see note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives  and note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements of phi 
phi and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices 
the definition of a derivative in the fasb guidance results in management having to exercise judgment  such as whether there is a notional amount or net settlement provision in contracts 
management assesses a number of factors before determining whether it can designate derivatives for the normal purchase or normal sale exception from derivative accounting  including whether it is probable that the contracts will physically settle with delivery of the underlying commodity 
the application of cash flow hedge accounting often requires judgment in the prospective and retrospective assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness as well as whether it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  internal models use market information when external broker quotes are not available 
for certain long dated instruments  broker or exchange data are extrapolated  or capacity prices are forecasted  for future periods where information is limited 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used for risk management purposes to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans phi believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and opeb benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact phi s expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  which affect the reported amount of annual net periodic pension and opeb cost on the income statement 

table of contents pepco holdings assumptions about the future  including the discount rate applied to benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
the discount rate for determining the pension benefit obligation was and as of december  and  respectively 
the discount rate for determining the postretirement benefit obligation was and as of december  and  respectively 
phi utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to select the discount rate 
the analytical tool utilizes a high quality bond portfolio with cash flows that match the benefit payments expected to be made under the plans 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets was and as of december  and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on postretirement benefit plan assets was and as of december  and  respectively 
phi uses a building block approach to estimate the expected rate of return on plan assets 
under this approach  the percentage of plan assets in each asset class according to phi s target asset allocation  at the beginning of the year  is applied to the expected asset return for the related asset class 
phi incorporates long term assumptions for real returns  inflation expectations  volatility  and correlations among asset classes to determine expected returns for the related asset class 
the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets consist of equity  fixed income  real estate and private equity investments  and when viewed over a long term horizon  are expected to yield a return on assets of as of december  the following table reflects the effect on the projected benefit obligation for the pension plan and the accumulated benefit obligation for the opeb plan  as well as the net periodic cost for both plans  if there were changes in these critical actuarial assumptions while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant in millions  except percentages change in assumptions impact on benefit obligation projected increase in net periodic cost pension plan discount rate expected return a postretirement benefit plan discount rate expected return a health care cost trend rate a a change in the expected return assumption has no impact on the projected benefit obligation 
the impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the average remaining service period of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediate recognition in the statements of income 
for additional discussion  see note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements of phi 
accounting for regulated activities fasb guidance on the accounting for regulated activities  regulated operations asc  applies to power delivery and can result in the deferral of costs or revenue that would otherwise be recognized by non regulated entities 
phi defers the recognition of costs and records regulatory assets when it is probable that those costs will be recovered in future customer rates 
phi defers the recognition of revenues and records regulatory liabilities when it is probable that it will refund payments received from customers in the future or that it will incur future costs related to the payments currently received from customers 
phi believes that the judgments involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i management must interpret laws and regulatory 
table of contents pepco holdings commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of costs in customer rates or the return of revenues to customers when determining whether those costs or revenues should be deferred  ii decisions made by regulatory commissions or legislative changes at a later date could vary from earlier interpretations made by management and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the elimination of a regulatory asset because deferred costs are no longer probable of recovery in future customer rates could have a material negative impact on phi s assets and earnings 
management s most significant judgment is whether to defer costs or revenues when there is not a current regulatory order specific to the item being considered for deferral 
in those cases  management considers relevant historical precedents of the regulatory commissions  the results of recent rate orders  and any new information from its more current interactions with the regulatory commissions on that item 
management regularly evaluates whether it should defer costs or revenues and reviews whether adjustments to its previous conclusions regarding its regulatory assets and liabilities are necessary based on the current regulatory and legislative environment as well as recent rate orders 
for additional discussion  see note  regulatory matters  to the consolidated financial statements of phi 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by phi s utility operations that have not yet been billed 
phi s utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
the calculation is based on the supply of electricity or natural gas distributed to customers but not yet billed  adjusted for estimated line losses estimates of electricity and gas expected to be lost in the process of a utility s transmission and distribution to customers 
phi estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors to the unbilled revenue calculation 
specifically  the determination of estimated line losses is inherently uncertain 
estimated line losses is defined as the estimates of electricity and natural gas expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers 
a change in estimated line losses can change the output available for sale which is a factor in the unbilled revenue calculation 
certain factors can influence the estimated line losses such as weather and a change in customer mix 
these factors may vary between companies due to geography and density of service territory  and the impact of changes in these factors could be material 
phi seeks to reduce the risk of an inaccurate estimate of unbilled revenue through corroboration of the estimate with historical information and other metrics 
accounting for income taxes phi exercises significant judgment about the outcome of income tax matters in its application of the fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes and believes it represents a critical accounting estimate because i it records a current tax liability for estimated current tax expense on its federal and state tax returns  ii it records deferred tax assets for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are more likely than not going to result in tax deductions in future years  iii it determines whether a valuation allowance is needed against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the future tax deductions will not be realized  iv it records deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return determination of pre tax income and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities if it is more likely than not that they are expected to result in tax payments in future years  v the measurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities requires it to estimate future effective tax rates and future taxable income on its federal and state tax returns  vi it asserts that foreign earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested abroad  vii it must consider the effect of newly enacted tax law on its estimated effective tax rate and in measuring deferred tax balances  and viii it asserts that tax positions in its tax returns or expected to be taken in its tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained assuming that the tax positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 

table of contents pepco holdings assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard that is  the cumulative result for a greater than chance of being realized has been met when developing the provision for current and deferred income taxes and the associated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
phi s assumptions  judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws and regulations  interpretation of current tax laws and regulations  the impact of newly enacted tax laws and regulations  developments in case law  settlements of tax positions  and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities 
phi has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although phi believes that these assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws and regulations or its interpretation of tax laws and regulations as well as the resolutions of the current and any future investigations or legal proceedings could significantly impact the financial results from applying the accounting for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
phi reviews its application of the more likely than not standard quarterly 
phi also evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets and the amount of any associated valuation allowance 
the forecast of future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors that can change over time  including growth assumptions  business conditions  returns on rate base  operating and capital expenditures  cost of capital  tax laws and regulations  the legal structure of entities and other factors  which could materially impact the realizability of deferred tax assets and the associated financial results in the consolidated financial statements

general overview pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in the district of columbia and significant portions of prince george s county and montgomery county in suburban maryland 
pepco also provides default electricity supply 
pepco s service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to maryland customers and approximately were to district of columbia customers 
pepco s results historically have been seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
for retail customers of pepco in maryland and in the district of columbia  revenue is not affected by unseasonably warmer or colder weather because a bsa for retail customers was implemented that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer rather than a charge based on energy usage 
the bsa has the effect of decoupling the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
as a result  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from customers in maryland and the district of columbia to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
changes in customer usage due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy savings programs or other reasons from period to period have no impact on reported distribution revenue for customers to whom the bsa applies 
in accounting for the bsa in maryland and the district of columbia  a revenue decoupling adjustment is recorded representing either i a positive adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from maryland and district of columbia retail distribution sales falls short of the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer or ii a negative adjustment equal to the amount by which revenue from such distribution sales exceeds the revenue that pepco is entitled to earn based on the approved distribution charge per customer 
pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of phi 
because phi is a public utility holding company subject to the public utility holding company act of puhca  the relationship between each of phi  phi service company a subsidiary service company of phi  which provides a variety of support services  including legal  accounting  treasury  tax  purchasing and information technology services to phi and its operating subsidiaries and pepco  as well as certain activities of pepco  are subject to ferc s regulatory oversight under puhca reliability enhancement since  pepco has implemented comprehensive reliability enhancement plans in its service territory 
these reliability enhancement plans include various initiatives to improve electrical system reliability  such as the identification and upgrading of under performing feeder lines  the addition of new facilities to support load  the installation of distribution automation systems on both the overhead and underground network systems  the rejuvenation and replacement of underground residential cables  
table of contents pepco selective undergrounding of portions of existing above ground primary feeder lines  where appropriate to improve reliability  improvements to substation supply lines  and enhanced vegetation management 
pepco s capital expenditures for continuing reliability enhancement efforts are included in the table of projected capital expenditures within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital requirements capital expenditures 
smart grid pepco is building a smart grid which is designed to meet the challenges of rising energy costs  concerns about the environment  reliability improvement  providing timely and accurate customer information and meeting government energy reduction goals

regulatory lag an important factor in the ability of pepco to earn its authorized rate of return is the willingness of applicable public service commissions to adequately recognize forward looking costs in its rate structure in order to address regulatory lag 
pepco is currently experiencing significant regulatory lag because its investment in the rate base and its operating expenses are outpacing revenue growth 
in an effort to minimize the effects of regulatory lag  pepco s district of columbia and maryland base rate case filings in each included a request for approval from the applicable state regulatory commissions of i a rim to recover reliability related capital expenditures incurred between base rate cases and ii the use by the applicable utility of fully forecasted test years in future base rate cases 
see note  regulatory matters rate proceedings  to the financial statements of pepco for a discussion of each of these mechanisms 
in pepco s base rate case order in maryland  the mpsc did not approve its request to implement the rim and did not endorse the use of fully forecasted test years in future rate cases 
however  the mpsc did permit an adjustment to the rate base to reflect the actual cost of reliability plant additions outside the test year 
in the district of columbia  the dcpsc denied pepco s request for approval of a rim  and reserved final judgment on the appropriateness of the use by pepco of a fully forecasted test year in future rate cases 
pepco will continue to seek cost recovery from the mpsc and the dcpsc to reduce the effects of regulatory lag 
there can be no assurance that any attempts by pepco to mitigate regulatory lag will be approved  or that even if approved  the cost recovery mechanisms will fully mitigate the effects of regulatory lag 
until such time as any cost recovery mechanisms are approved  pepco plans to file rate cases at least annually in an effort to align more closely the revenue and cash flow levels of pepco with its other operation and maintenance spending and capital investments 
in addition to the electric distribution base rate case filed by pepco in maryland on november   pepco intends to file its next electric distribution base rate case with the dcpsc in the first quarter of mapp project on august   the board of pjm terminated the mapp project and removed it from pjm s regional transmission expansion plan

certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives based on fasb guidance on derivatives and hedging  asc pepco energy services also manages commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the crmc  which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as energy commodity activities 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of the energy commodity activities of pepco energy services 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
phi uses a delta gamma var estimation model 
the other parameters include a percent  one tailed confidence level and a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur
