executive overview our continuing operations are principally engaged in providing investment banking  institutional brokerage  asset management and related financial services to corporations  private equity groups  public entities  non profit entities and institutional investors in the united states and europe 
we operate through two reportable business segments capital markets the capital markets segment provides institutional sales  trading and research services and investment banking services 
institutional sales  trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions  government and non profit entities 
revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities  net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory  and profits and losses from trading these securities 
investment banking services include management of and participation in underwritings  merger and acquisition services and public finance activities 
revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees 
also  we generate revenue through strategic trading activities  which focus on proprietary investments in municipal bond and non agency mortgage backed securities  and merchant banking activities  which involve equity or debt investments in late stage private companies 
as certain of these efforts have matured and an investment process has been developed  we have created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking and municipal securities in order to invest firm capital as well as seek capital from outside investors 
we receive management and performance fees for managing these funds 
asset management the asset management segment provides traditional asset management services with product offerings in equity and master limited partnership mlp securities to institutions and individuals through proprietary distribution channels 
revenues are generated in the form of management and performance fees 
the majority of our performance fees  if earned  are generally recognized in the fourth quarter 
revenues are also generated through investments in the partnerships and funds that we manage 
our discontinued operations for all periods presented include the operating results of our hong kong capital markets business and fiduciary asset management  llc famco  a division of our asset management segment 
as of september   we ceased operations related to our hong kong capital markets business 
as a result of discontinuing this business  we will realize net cash proceeds of approximately million  due principally to a us tax benefit for the realized loss on the investment in our hong kong subsidiaries 
the results of the hong kong capital markets business were previously reported in our capital markets segment 
we are actively pursuing a sale of famco 
strategically  given its client base  limited scale and investment strategies  it is not a compelling fit with the rest of our asset management business 
in light of this  famco is classified as held for sale and reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the results of famco were previously reported in our asset management segment 
as discussed in part i  item of this form k  in the first quarter of we reorganized our famco and ari reporting units  resulting in famco mlp business becoming part of ari 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations 
our business is a human capital business 
accordingly  compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses  and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract  develop and retain highly skilled employees who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients

external factors impacting our business performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  changes in interest rates especially rapid and extreme changes  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the demand for asset management services as reflected by the amount of assets under management 
factors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry may also affect our financial results 
for example  our business focuses on a middle market clientele in specific industry sectors 
if the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted disproportionately as compared to the economy as a whole  or does not recover on pace with other sectors of the economy  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
in addition  our business could be affected differently than overall market trends 
given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses  our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results 
as a participant in the financial services industry  we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of our business 
in recent years and following the credit crisis of  legislators and regulators increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry  resulting in fundamental changes to the manner in which the industry is regulated and increased regulation in a number of areas 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in bringing sweeping change to financial services regulation in the us changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could affect our business and the competitive environment  potentially adversely 
outlook for we believe a gradual economic recovery will continue into with the potential to benefit several of our businesses 
we are mindful  however  that certain factors could cause a more challenging economic environment to emerge in the impact of recent tax increases and pending spending cuts could have a negative impact on economic growth 
in addition  the ongoing political debate related to the us debt ceiling limit  the federal budget  and the level of federal deficit spending will intensify in early as we have seen in recent years  global issues like the european debt crisis also can impact the us economy and our businesses 
in  equity market volatility remained near a five year low and the equity markets posted positive results  which resulted in increased us capital markets activity as compared to we believe that the level of us capital markets activity will continue to improve in if the key economic metrics remain strong 
however  this level of activity can change rapidly as economic and market indicators fluctuate 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded strong advisory services revenues partially attributed to sellers desire to complete deals prior to the year end and pending tax increases 
this may result in lower advisory activity in early we anticipate that interest rates will remain at historically low levels throughout consistent with policy statements communicated by the us federal reserve 
the low interest rate environment  which aided our tax exempt financing revenues in  will continue to provide a favorable environment for refinancing of existing debt 
we generated robust fixed income institutional brokerage revenue in  particularly related to our strategic trading activities 
these revenues will vary from period to period as a result of the timing of transactions based on market opportunities and other economic factors 
our asset management performance in will continue to be dependent upon equity valuations and our investment performance  which can impact the amount of client inflows and outflows of assets under management 
lastly  over the past few years  there has been a market trend of assets flowing out of equities into fixed income or alternative asset classes 
we believe there are early indications that this trend may be reversing

we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are our critical accounting policies 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  and certain of our investments recorded in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments recorded at fair value  either as required by accounting guidance or through the fair value election 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the nature of our business and our role as a dealer in the securities industry or our role as a manager of alternative asset management funds  the fair values of our financial instruments are determined internally 
our processes are designed to ensure that the fair values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  unobservable inputs are developed based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data  including prices evidenced by market transactions  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities and correlations  and other security specific information 
valuation adjustments related to illiquidity or counterparty credit risk are also considered 
in estimating fair value  we may use information provided by third party pricing vendors to corroborate internally developed fair value estimates 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
results from valuation models and other valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of the future period fair value measurement 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of such financial instruments are the cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar quality and yield  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
in addition  even where we derive the value of a security based on information from an independent source  certain assumptions may be required to determine the security s fair value 
for example  we assume that the size of positions that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current estimated fair value 
depending upon the product and terms of the transaction  the fair value of our derivative contracts can be observed or priced using models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments  including contractual terms  yield curves  discount rates and measures of volatility 
the valuation models and underlying assumptions are monitored over the life of the derivative product 
if there are any changes necessary in the underlying inputs  the model is updated for those new inputs 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurement  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to inputs with little or no pricing observability level iii measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the following table reflects the composition of our level iii assets and level iii liabilities by asset class level iii december  december  dollars in thousands assets financial instruments and other inventory positions owned corporate securities fixed income securities municipal securities tax exempt securities short term securities asset backed securities derivative contracts total financial instruments and other inventory positions owned investments total assets liabilities financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased corporate securities convertible securities fixed income securities derivative contracts total financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased the following table reflects activity with respect to our level iii assets and liabilities year ended december  dollars in thousands assets purchases sales transfers in transfers out realized gains losses unrealized gains losses liabilities purchases sales transfers in transfers out realized losses unrealized losses see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of level iii assets and liabilities 
we employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our financial instruments 
our processes are designed to ensure that the internally estimated fair values are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques used are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
individuals outside of the trading departments perform independent pricing verification reviews as of each reporting date 
we have established parameters which set forth when securities are independently verified 
the selection parameters are generally based upon the type of security  the level of estimation risk of a security  the materiality of the security to our financial statements  changes in fair value from period to period  and other specific facts and circumstances of our security portfolio 
in evaluating the initial internally estimated fair values made by our traders  the nature and complexity of securities involved eg term  coupon  collateral  and other key drivers of value  level of market activity for securities  and availability of market data are considered 
the independent price verification procedures include  but are not limited to  analysis of trade data both internal and external where available  corroboration to the valuation of positions with similar characteristics  risks and components  or comparison to an alternative pricing source  such as a discounted cash flow model 
we have a valuation committee  comprised of members of senior management  that provides oversight and overall responsibility for the internal control processes and procedures related to fair value measurements 
goodwill and intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million  all of which relates to our asset management segment 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  asc we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist that could indicate possible impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the two step impairment test  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units based on the following factors our market capitalization  a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
valuation multiples may be based on revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  price to earnings or cash flows of comparable public companies and business segments 
these multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences including size  operating leverage and other factors 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are compared with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as noted above  the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and the subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets or businesses will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
our estimated cash flows typically extend for five years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended time period 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces and changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  discount rates and market conditions 
to assess the reasonableness of cash flow estimates and validate assumptions used in our estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and our industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in the first quarter of  we reorganized our famco and ari reporting units  resulting in famco mlp business becoming part of ari  which triggered an interim impairment analysis of our goodwill 
we concluded there was no impairment 
in accordance with asc  million of the million in goodwill attributable to our acquisition of famco was reallocated to the ari reporting unit 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november   and concluded there was no goodwill impairment from continuing operations  which consists of our ari reporting unit 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our famco reporting unit reported within discontinued operations 
the amount represents the full value of goodwill attributable to the famco reporting unit 
we estimated the fair value of our famco reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and the anticipated sales price for famco  which is classified as held for sale 
we also tested the intangible assets indefinite and definite lived and concluded there was no impairment 
in  our annual goodwill impairment testing resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the charge related to our capital markets reporting unit and primarily pertained to goodwill created from the acquisition of our predecessor  piper jaffray companies  inc  and its subsidiaries by us bancorp  which was retained by us when we spun off from us bancorp on december  compensation plans stock based compensation plans as part of our compensation to employees and directors  we use stock based compensation  consisting of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
the company accounts for equity awards in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized on the consolidated statements of operations at grant date fair value over the service period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures 
we grant shares of restricted stock to current employees as part of year end compensation annual grants and as a retention tool 
employees may receive restricted stock with service conditions upon initial hiring or as a retention award sign on grants 
we have also granted incremental restricted stock awards with service conditions to key employees retention grants  as well as restricted stock awards with performance conditions to members of senior management performance grants 
on may   we granted restricted stock units with market conditions to our leadership team leadership grants 
upon closing of the ari acquisition in march  we granted restricted stock with service conditions to ari employees inducement grants 
annual grants are made each february for the prior fiscal year performance and constitute a portion of an employee s annual incentive for the prior year 
we recognize the compensation expense prior to the grant date of the award as we determined that the service inception date precedes the grant date 
these grants are not subject to service requirements that employees must fulfill in exchange for the right to these awards  as the grants continue to vest after termination of employment  so long as the employee does not violate certain post termination restrictions as set forth in the award agreements or any agreements entered into upon termination 
prior to  annual grants were subject to three year cliff vesting 
beginning in  annual grants are subject to annual ratable vesting over a three year period 
unvested shares are subject to post termination restrictions 
these post termination restrictions do not meet the criteria for an in substance service condition as defined by asc accordingly  such shares of restricted stock comprising annual grants are expensed in the period to which those awards are deemed to be earned  which is the calendar year preceding the february grant date 
if any of these awards are forfeited  the lower of the fair value at grant date or the fair value at the date of forfeiture is recorded within the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of compensation and benefits expense 
sign on grants are used as a recruiting tool for new employees and are issued to current employees as a retention tool 
the majority of these awards have three year cliff vesting terms and employees must fulfill service requirements in exchange for the right to the awards 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded 
retention grants and inducement grants are subject to ratable vesting based upon a five year service requirement and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested retention shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded 
performance based restricted stock awards granted in and cliff vest upon meeting a specific performance based metric prior to may performance grants are amortized on a straight line basis over the period we expect the performance target to be met 
the performance condition must be met for the awards to vest and total compensation cost will be recognized only if the performance condition is satisfied 
the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and that the awards will vest is reevaluated each reporting period with changes in actual or estimated outcomes accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment to compensation expense 
in the third quarter of  we deemed it improbable that the performance condition related to the performance grants would be met 
as a result  we recorded a million cumulative effect compensation expense reversal in the third quarter of as of december   we continue to believe it is improbable that the performance condition will be met prior to the expiration of the award 
the leadership grants will vest and convert to shares of common stock at the end of the month performance period only if the company satisfies predetermined market conditions over the performance period that began on may  and ends on may  under the terms of the grant  the number of units that will vest and convert to shares will be based on the achievement of certain levels of absolute and relative shareholder return during the performance period 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the three year requisite service period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the market conditions must be met for the awards to vest and compensation cost will be recognized regardless if the market conditions are satisfied 
employees forfeit unvested share units upon termination of employment with a corresponding reversal of compensation expense 
stock based compensation granted to our non employee directors is in the form of unrestricted common shares of piper jaffray companies stock 
the stock based compensation paid to non employee directors is expensed on the grant date and included in our results of operations as outside services expense 
we granted stock options in fiscal years through the options were expensed on a straight line basis over the required service period  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model required management to exercise judgment with respect to certain assumptions  including the expected dividend yield  the expected volatility  and the expected life of the options 
as described above pertaining to our annual grants of restricted shares  stock options granted to employees were expensed in the calendar year preceding the annual february grant 
stock options have a ten year life and will begin expiring in deferred compensation plan we established a deferred compensation plan in  which allows eligible employees to elect to receive a portion of the incentive compensation they would otherwise receive in the form of restricted stock or other equity  instead in restricted mutual fund shares mfrs awards of registered funds managed by our asset management business 
mfrs awards are awarded to qualifying employees in february of each year  and represent a portion of their compensation for performance in the preceding year similar to our annual grants 
mfrs awards vest ratably over three years in equal installments and provide for continued vesting after termination of employment so long as the employee does not violate certain post termination restrictions set forth in the award agreement or any agreement entered into upon termination 
forfeitures are recorded as a reduction of compensation and benefits expenses within the consolidated statements of operations 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  established reserves for potential losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties regarding timing  size  volume and outcome of pending and potential legal proceedings and other factors  the amounts of reserves are difficult to determine and of necessity subject to future revision 
income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return  which includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries 
we also are subject to income tax in various states and municipalities and those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in reporting certain items  principally  amortization of share based compensation 
the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we believe that our future taxable profits will be sufficient to recognize our us deferred tax assets 
however  if our projections of future taxable profits do not materialize  we may conclude that a valuation allowance is necessary  which would impact our results of operations in that period 
as of december   we have a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to our uk subsidiary s net operating loss carryforwards  which represents all but million of the uk subsidiary s deferred tax asset 
we anticipate being able to reverse the full amount of our uk subsidiary valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of  based upon achieving three years of profitability and projected future earnings 
this will result in a tax benefit to our results of operations 
in connection with the closure of our hong kong capital markets business  we realized a million us tax benefit due to a realized loss on the investment in our hong kong subsidiaries 
the tax benefit represents the excess of the tax basis of our investment in the subsidiaries over the financial statement carrying amount the deductible outside basis difference 
we recorded the tax benefit within discontinued operations for the year ended december  we record deferred tax benefits for future tax deductions expected upon the vesting of share based compensation 
if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation ie  the value of the share based compensation at the time of vesting exceed the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting ie  the grant date fair value of the compensation computed in accordance with asc  we record the excess tax benefit as additional paid in capital 
conversely  if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation are less than the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting  we offset the deficiency first to any previously recognized excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital and any remaining deficiency is recorded as income tax expense 
as of december   we did not have any available excess tax benefits within additional paid in capital 
approximately  shares of restricted stock vested in at values less than the grant date fair value resulting in million of income tax expense in approximately  shares vested in the first quarter of  resulting in million of excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital in the first quarter of we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  when it is not more likely than not that a certain position or component of a position will be ultimately upheld by the relevant taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
our tax provision and related accruals include the impact of estimates for uncertain tax positions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
to the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such change in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period of change and  in turn  our results of operations 
in  we recorded reversals of previously accrued uncertain state income tax positions of million  net of federal income tax 
liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity is of critical importance to us given the nature of our business 
insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to  and may be the cause of  financial institution failure 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions  and we have implemented a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances  although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances 
the majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions 
receivables and payables with brokers  dealers and clearing organizations usually settle within a few days 
as part of our liquidity strategy  we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible while considering terms and cost 
our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations  equity capital  and our funding arrangements 
the fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are directly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses 
one of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet 
while our asset base changes due to client activity  market fluctuations and business opportunities  the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect our overall risk tolerance  our ability to access stable funding sources and the amount of equity capital we hold 
the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents  or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash or accessible for liquidity purposes within a short period of time average balance for the december  year ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash in banks cash in banks reserved for credit agreement repayment money market investments total cash and cash equivalents average balance calculated based upon ending daily balances 
in addition  we had cash and cash equivalents segregated of million and million that was available exclusively for customer liabilities included on our balance sheet as of december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents segregated consist of deposits in accordance with rule c of the securities exchange act of  which subjects piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary carrying client accounts  to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of our clients 
a portion of these financial instruments are held within our regulated entities and our ability to transfer these financial instruments out of our regulated entities is limited by net capital requirements that apply to those entities only 
our regulated entities could seek regulatory approval to dividend these financial instruments to the parent for liquidity purposes  however  this could curtail our revenue producing activities within our regulated entities if it reduced our net capital 
certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions  requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results 
a significant component of our employees compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation 
the timing of these incentive compensation payments  which generally are made in february  has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity 
we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to in the foreseeable future 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock through september  in the first nine months of  we repurchased  shares or million of our common stock related to this authorization 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to million in common shares through september  this new authorization became effective october  we repurchased  shares or million of our common stock related to this new authorization 
we also purchase shares of common stock from restricted stock award recipients upon the award vesting as recipients sell shares to meet their employment tax obligations 
during  we purchased  shares or million of our common shares for this purpose 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
inventory increased related to the expansion of our fixed income sales and trading efforts to support customer flow and increases related to our strategic trading portfolios 
the increase is also attributable to the low level of inventory we maintained at the end of as we managed risk due to more volatile market conditions at that time 
partially offsetting these increases in operating assets were increases in operating liabilities  particularly related to accrued compensation  payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and other liabilities and accrued expenses 
investing activities in used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was provided through financing activities  primarily an increase in short term financing  offset in part by decreases in repurchase agreements 
a significant portion of our funding needs are driven by the levels of long inventory positions 
as we increased our levels of long inventory in  it led to an increase in funding needs  particularly related to short term financing 
additionally  we entered into a note purchase agreement under which we issued unsecured variable rate senior notes in late  which provided million in financing that was used to repay our bank syndicated credit agreement which had million outstanding as of december  offsetting these increases to financing was million used to repurchase common stock 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities provided million of cash 
late in  to manage risk due to volatile market conditions  we reduced long inventory balances  which increased our cash position 
this reduction in long inventory resulted in a decreased receivable related to unsettled inventory trades  which provided additional cash flow 
the reduction in long inventory also allowed us to reduce our short inventory hedges  which resulted in a decrease of our securities purchased under agreements to resell  when compared to december  partially offsetting these increases in cash was a decrease in operating liabilities  particularly related to accrued compensation and other liabilities and accrued expenses 
additionally  included in our net loss of million was a non cash goodwill charge of million 
investing activities in used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was used through financing activities 
a significant portion of our funding needs are driven by the levels of long inventory positions 
as we lowered our levels of long inventory late in  it led to a reduction in funding needs  particularly related to repurchase agreements 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
during  market conditions improved and as a result  we increased certain inventory balances to take advantage of opportunities in the market and to serve our clients 
investing activities in used million of cash  the majority of which related to our acquisition of ari 
cash of million was provided through financing activities  primarily an increase in repurchase agreements and issuance of commercial paper  offset in part by million utilized to repurchase common stock 
cash from financing activities was used to fund our acquisition of ari and increased levels of securities inventory 
additionally  we entered into a three year bank syndicated credit agreement in late  which provided million in financing that was used to repay the million in variable rate senior notes on december  leverage the following table presents total assets  adjusted assets  total shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity with the resulting leverage ratios as of december dollars in thousands total assets deduct goodwill and intangible assets adjusted assets total shareholders equity deduct goodwill and intangible assets tangible shareholders equity leverage ratio adjusted leverage ratio leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity 
adjusted assets and tangible shareholders equity are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numeric measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap measure 
goodwill and intangible assets are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible shareholders equity  respectively  as we believe that goodwill and intangible assets do not constitute operating assets which can be deployed in a liquid manner 
we view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage  also a non gaap financial measure  as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies 
our leverage ratio and adjusted leverage ratio increased from december  to december  as a result of higher inventory balances 
our alternative asset management funds in municipal securities use leverage on a daily basis  generally through borrowings from their prime broker to purchase financial instruments and interest rate swaps 
the level of borrowings fluctuates within a targeted average portfolio leverage level depending on market conditions and opportunities 
the use of leverage increases the risk of losses due to factors such as rising interest rates 
the rates at which the funds can borrow may have a substantial effect on performance 
volatility or illiquidity in the financial markets may also cause leverage to no longer be available 
the impact of our alternative asset management funds are included in the above table 
funding and capital resources the primary goal of our funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market conditions 
given the mix of our business activities  funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of short term and long term financing 
we attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain funding from external sources 
access to these external sources  as well as the cost of that financing  is dependent upon various factors  including market conditions  the general availability of credit and credit ratings 
we currently do not have a credit rating  which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our financing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing the funds 
short term financing our day to day funding and liquidity is obtained primarily through the use of repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuance  prime broker agreements  and bank lines of credit  and is typically collateralized by our securities inventory 
these funding sources are critical to our ability to finance and hold inventory  which is a necessary part of our institutional brokerage and municipal bond funds businesses 
the majority of our inventory is very liquid and is therefore funded by overnight or short term facilities 
these short term facilities ie  our committed line  term repurchase agreement and commercial paper have been established to mitigate changes in the liquidity of our inventory based on changing market conditions 
our funding sources are also dependent on the types of inventory that our counterparties are willing to accept as collateral and the number of counterparties available 
from time to time the number of counterparties that will enter into municipal repurchase agreements can be limited based on market conditions 
currently  the majority of our bank lines  our commercial paper programs and our prime broker arrangement will accept municipal inventory as collateral  which helps mitigate this municipal repurchase agreement counterparty risk 
we also have established arrangements to obtain financing by another broker dealer at the end of each business day related specifically to our convertible inventory 
funding is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate and or the london interbank offer rate 
commercial paper program our us broker dealer subsidiary  piper jaffray co  issues secured commercial paper to fund a portion of its securities inventory 
this commercial paper is issued under two separate programs  cp series a and cp series ii a  and is secured by different inventory classes  which is reflected in the interest rate paid on the respective program 
the maximum amount that may be issued under cp series a and cp series ii a is million and million  respectively 
at december   cp series a had million outstanding and cp series ii a had million outstanding 
both programs can issue with maturities of to days 
the weighted average maturity of cp series a and cp series ii a as of december  was days and days  respectively 
prime broker arrangement we have established an arrangement to obtain overnight financing by a single prime broker related to our alternative asset management funds in municipal securities 
financing under this arrangement is secured by certain securities  primarily municipal securities  and collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under this arrangement 
more specifically  this funding is at the discretion of the prime broker and could be denied  which may be particularly true during times of market stress or market perceptions of our exposures 
at december   we had million of financing outstanding under this prime broker arrangement 
uncommitted lines we use uncommitted lines in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under our uncommitted lines varies daily based on our funding needs 
our uncommitted secured lines total million with two banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral  as determined by the bank agreement  to secure an advance under the line 
collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under these secured lines 
we also have a million uncommitted unsecured facility with one of these banks 
all of these uncommitted lines are discretionary and are not a commitment by the bank to provide an advance under the line 
more specifically  these lines are subject to approval by the respective bank each time an advance is requested and advances may be denied  which may be particularly true during times of market stress or market perceptions of our exposures 
we manage our relationships with the banks that provide these uncommitted facilities in order to have appropriate levels of funding for our business 
at december   we had no outstanding advances against these lines of credit 
committed lines our committed line is a one year million revolving secured credit facility 
we use this credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under the facility varies daily based on our funding needs 
advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities 
the facility includes a covenant that requires piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary  to maintain a minimum net capital of million  and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on december  at december   we had no advances against this line of credit

 maximum amount of daily funding variable rate senior notes on november   we entered into a note purchase agreement note purchase agreement under which we issued unsecured variable rate senior notes notes in the amount of million 
the initial holders of the notes are certain entities advised by pacific investment management company llc pimco 
the notes consist of two classes  class a notes and class b notes  with principal amounts of million and million  respectively 
the unpaid principal amount of the class a notes and class b notes will be due on may  and november   respectively 
the proceeds from the notes were used to repay the outstanding balance under the three year bank syndicated credit agreement credit agreement  which eliminated our obligation to comply with the covenants under the credit agreement  including limitations on our share repurchasing activity 
the remaining proceeds are used for general corporate purposes 
the note purchase agreement includes customary events of default  including failure to pay principal when due or failure to pay interest within five business days of when due  any representation or warranty in the note purchase agreement proving untrue in any material respect when made by us  failure to comply with the covenants in the note purchase agreement  failure to pay or another event of default under other material indebtedness in an amount exceeding million  bankruptcy or insolvency or a change in control 
if there is any event of default  the noteholders may exercise customary remedies  including declaring the entire principal and any accrued interest on the notes to be due and payable 
the note purchase agreement includes covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and minimum regulatory net capital  limit our leverage ratio and require maintenance of a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to fixed charges 
with respect to the net capital covenant  our us broker dealer subsidiary is required to maintain minimum net capital of million 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
three year bank syndicated credit agreement on december   we entered into a credit agreement comprised of a million amortizing term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the unpaid principal and interest on the credit agreement was paid off on november  from the proceeds of the notes 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the contractual amounts at december   in total and by remaining maturity 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including secured financing transactions  trading liabilities  short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities 
on may   we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of office space for the company s headquarters 
the term of the lease commences on june   and expires on november   and includes an option to terminate the lease early effective january  our contractual rental obligations for the full year lease term are million 
and dollars in millions thereafter total operating lease obligations purchase commitments investment commitments a loan commitments b variable rate senior notes a the investment commitments have no specified call dates  however  the investment period for these funds is through the timing of capital calls is based on market conditions and investment opportunities 
investment commitments of million related to a commitment to an affiliated merchant banking fund 
b we may commit to merchant banking financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite debt 
we are unable to estimate the timing on the funding of these commitments and have no commitments outstanding at this time 
purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase commitments with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase commitments contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligation table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member firm of finra  our us broker dealer subsidiary is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the sec and the net capital rule of finra 
we have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule  which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of the greater of million or percent of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions  as this is defined in the rule 
finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying dividends if resulting net capital would be less than percent of aggregate debit balances 
advances to affiliates  repayment of subordinated liabilities  dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain notification and other provisions of the uniform net capital rules 
we expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations 
we also are subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital from our broker dealer subsidiary 
at december   our net capital under the sec s uniform net capital rule was million  and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the sec rule by million 
although we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by finra and the sec  a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our capital markets revenue producing activities 
piper jaffray ltd  our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the united kingdom  is subject to the capital requirements of the uk financial services authority 
our piper jaffray entities operating in the hong kong region are registered under the laws of hong kong and subject to the liquid capital requirements of the securities and futures finance resources rule promulgated under the securities and futures ordinance 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements at december  and expiration per period at december  total contractual amount december  december  dollars in thousands later customer matched book derivative contracts trading securities derivative contracts credit default swap index contracts private equity investment commitments consists of interest rate swaps 
we have minimal market risk related to these matched book derivative contracts  however  we do have counterparty risk with two major financial institutions  which is mitigated by collateral deposits 
in addition  we have a limited number of counterparties contractual amount of million at december  who are not required to post collateral 
the uncollateralized amounts  representing the fair value of the derivative contracts  expose us to the credit risk of these counterparties 
at december   we had million of credit exposure with these counterparties  including million of credit exposure with one counterparty 
we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional or contract amount overstates the expected payout 
at december  and  the net fair value of these derivative contracts approximated million and million  respectively 
the investment commitments have no specified call dates  however  the investment period for these funds is through the timing of capital calls is based on market conditions and investment opportunities 
derivatives derivatives notional contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
rather  the fair value of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  as applicable 
derivatives are reported on a net basis by counterparty when a legal right of offset exists and on a net basis by cross product when applicable provisions are stated in a master netting agreement 
we enter into derivative contracts in a principal capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients 
we also use derivative products to hedge the interest rate and market value risks associated with our security positions 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative products  see note  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments we may commit to bridge loan financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite corporate debt 
we had no loan commitments outstanding at december  private equity and other principal investments a component of our private equity and principal investments  including investments made as part of our merchant banking activities  are made through investments in various legal entities  typically partnerships or limited liability companies  established for the purpose of investing in securities of private companies or municipal debt obligations 
we commit capital or act as the managing partner of these entities 
some of these entities are deemed to be variable interest entities 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to these types of entities  see note  variable interest entities  to our consolidated financial statements 
we have committed capital to certain entities and these commitments generally have no specified call dates 
we had million of commitments outstanding at december   of which million related to a commitment to an affiliated merchant banking fund 
other off balance sheet exposure our other types of off balance sheet arrangements include contractual commitments 
for a discussion of our activities related to these off balance sheet arrangements  see note  contingencies  commitments and guarantees  to our consolidated financial statements 
enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business 
in the course of conducting business operations  we are exposed to a variety of risks 
market risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal  regulatory and compliance risk  and reputational risk are the principal risks we face in operating our business 
we seek to identify  assess and monitor each risk in accordance with defined policies and procedures 
the extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
with respect to market risk and credit risk  the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders  trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions  including those associated with our strategic trading activities  and overall risk profile 
our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis 
the broader objectives of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area  to consolidate risk monitoring company wide  to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies  to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management  and to ensure accurate fair values of our financial instruments 
in addition to supporting daily risk management processes on the trading desks  our risk management functions support our financial risk committee and valuation committee 
the financial risk committee oversees risk management practices  including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies 
risk management techniques  processes and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk  and any risk management failures could expose us to material unanticipated losses 
market risk market risk represents the risk of financial volatility that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients  to our market making activities and our strategic trading activities 
market risks are inherent to both cash and derivative financial instruments 
the scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market sensitive financial instruments 
our different types of market risk include interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  changes in credit spreads  and the rate of prepayments on our interest earning assets including client cash balances  investments  inventories  and resale agreements and our funding sources including client cash balances  short term and bank syndicated financing  and repurchase agreements  which finance these assets 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of appropriate hedging in us government securities  agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  interest rate swaps  options  futures and forward contracts 
we use interest rate swap contracts and mmd rate lock agreements to hedge a portion of our fixed income inventory 
these interest rate swap contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
equity price risk equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices 
we are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities in the us market on both listed and over the counter equity markets 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on the notional level of our inventory and by managing net position levels within those limits 
currency risk currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations or a foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the shareholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition and other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
value at risk value at risk var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions  excluding non controlling interests  due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we perform a daily var analysis on substantially all of our trading positions  including fixed income  equities  convertible bonds  asset backed securities  and all associated economic hedges 
these positions encompass both customer related and strategic trading activities 
we use a var model because it provides a common metric for assessing market risk across business lines and products 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of risk exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes and individual securities 
we use a monte carlo simulation methodology for var calculations 
we believe this methodology provides var results that properly reflect the risk profile of all our instruments  including those that contain optionality  and also accurately models correlation movements among all of our asset classes 
in addition  it provides improved tail results as there are no assumptions of distribution  and can provide additional insight for scenario shock analysis 
model based var derived from simulation has inherent limitations including reliance on historical data to predict future market risk  var calculated using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the modeling of the market risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table quantifies the model based var simulated for each component of market risk for the periods presented  which are computed using the past days of historical data 
when calculating var we use a percent confidence level and a one day time horizon 
this means that  over time  there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any given day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the var amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in a day trading period 
at december  dollars in thousands interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
we view average var over a period of time as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
the table below illustrates the daily high  low and average value at risk calculated for each component of market risk during the years ended december  and  respectively 
dollars in thousands high low average for the year ended december  interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk dollars in thousands high low average for the year ended december  interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
because high and low var numbers for these risk categories may have occurred on different days  high and low numbers for diversification benefit would not be meaningful 
trading losses exceeded our one day var on two occasions during the aggregate var as of december  was consistent with levels reported as of december  although inventories were higher year over year  the december  var level is the result of reductions in some inventories with higher var exposure  adjustments in hedging at the end of the year  and lower realized volatility over the previous measuring period 
in addition to var  we also employ additional measures to monitor and manage market risk exposure including the following net market position  duration exposure  option sensitivities  and inventory turnover 
all metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals 
liquidity risk market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
depending on the specific security  the structure of the financial product  and or overall market conditions  we may be forced to hold a security for substantially longer than we had planned 
our inventory positions  including those associated with strategic trading activities  subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk in our day to day funding activities 
we have a relatively low leverage ratio of and adjusted leverage ratio of as of december   as discussed above 
we manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products 
for example  our treasury department actively manages the use of our committed bank line  repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuance and secured and unsecured bank borrowings each day depending on pricing  availability of funding  available collateral and lending parameters from any one of these sources 
in addition to managing our capital and funding  the treasury department oversees the management of net interest income risk and the overall use of our capital  funding  and balance sheet 
we currently act as the remarketing agent for approximately billion of variable rate demand notes  the majority of which have a financial institution providing a liquidity guarantee 
at certain times  demand from buyers of variable rate demand notes is less than the supply generated by sellers of these instruments 
in times of supply and demand imbalance  we may but are not obligated to facilitate liquidity by purchasing variable rate demand notes from sellers for our own account 
our liquidity risk related to variable rate demand notes is ultimately mitigated by our ability to tender these securities back to the financial institution providing the liquidity guarantee 
credit risk credit risk in our business arises from potential non performance by counterparties  customers  borrowers or issuers of securities we hold in our trading inventory 
the global credit crisis also has created increased credit risk  particularly counterparty risk  as the interconnectedness of the financial markets has caused market participants to be impacted by systemic pressure  or contagion  that results from the failure or potential failure of market participants 
we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting credit reviews of financial counterparties  and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
we have concentrated counterparty credit exposure with six non publicly rated entities totaling million at december  this counterparty credit exposure is part of our derivative program  consisting primarily of interest rate swaps 
one derivative counterparty represents percent  or million  of this exposure 
credit exposure associated with our derivative counterparties is driven by uncollateralized market movements in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts and is monitored regularly by our financial risk committee 
we attempt to minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management 
we are exposed to credit risk in our role as a trading counterparty to dealers and customers  as a holder of securities and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement and financing of various transactions 
client activities are transacted on a delivery versus payment  cash or margin basis 
our credit exposure to institutional client business is mitigated by the use of industry standard delivery versus payment through depositories and clearing banks 
credit exposure associated with our customer margin accounts in the us is monitored daily 
our risk management functions have credit risk policies establishing appropriate credit limits and collateralization thresholds for our customers utilizing margin lending 
merchant banking debt investments that have been funded are recorded in other assets at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
at december   we had two funded merchant banking debt investments totaling million 
merchant banking investments are monitored regularly by our financial risk committee 
our risk management functions review risk associated with institutional counterparties with whom we hold repurchase and resale agreement facilities  stock borrow or loan facilities  derivatives  tbas and other documented institutional counterparty agreements that may give rise to credit exposure 
counterparty levels are established relative to the level of counterparty ratings and potential levels of activity 
we are subject to credit concentration risk if we hold large individual securities positions  execute large transactions with individual counterparties or groups of related counterparties  extend large loans to individual borrowers or make substantial underwriting commitments 
concentration risk can occur by industry  geographic area or type of client 
potential credit concentration risk is carefully monitored through review of counterparties and borrowers and is managed through the use of policies and limits 
we also are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in the credit spreads of debt instruments 
credit spread risk arises from potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or the market s perception of the issuer s credit worthiness 
we use credit default swap index contracts to mitigate this risk 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
we rely on the ability of our employees  our internal systems and processes and systems at computer centers operated by third parties to process a large number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our systems or processes or improper action by our employees or third party vendors  we could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation 
we have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company wide basis  and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operations policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
legal  regulatory and compliance risk legal  regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have established procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  those related to regulatory net capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  credit extension  money laundering  privacy and recordkeeping 
we have established internal policies relating to ethics and business conduct  and compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  as well as training and other procedures designed to ensure that these policies are followed 
reputation and other risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is critical 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the conduct of our business activities and the types of clients and counterparties with whom we conduct business 
we seek to maintain our reputation by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards and performing appropriate reviews of clients and counterparties 
other risks include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we review new and pending regulations and legislation 
for example  policy discussions surrounding the debt and deficits of the federal government  including recent discussions around the fiscal cliff  have resulted in various proposals to increase revenue  including through restructuring of the federal tax code 
the american jobs act of and the debt reduction act of proposed capping tax exempt interest for higher income taxpayers  and the bipartisan tax fairness and simplification act  introduced in the us senate earlier in  proposed the use of tax credit bonds over tax exempt bonds  which also could have a negative impact on municipal issuance 
effects of inflation because our assets are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
