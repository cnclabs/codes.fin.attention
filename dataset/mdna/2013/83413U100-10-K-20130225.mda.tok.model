table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of portfolio investments we conduct the valuation of our assets  pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined  at all times consistent with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the act and generally value our assets on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if required 
our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange shall be valued at the closing price on the day of valuation 
we may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets 
when doing so  we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to gaap to determine the fair value of the security 
if determined adequate  we use the quote obtained 
securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that  in the judgment of our investment adviser or board of directors  does not represent fair value  shall each be valued as follows i each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  ii preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management  iii independent third party valuation firms engaged by  or on behalf of  the board of directors will conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and make their own assessment for all material assets  iv the board of directors will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the investment adviser and  where appropriate  the respective third party valuation firms 
the recommendation of fair value will generally consider the following factors among others  as relevant the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the issuer does business  and comparisons to publicly traded securities 
securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include  but are not limited to  the following private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market  securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available  debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market  securities whose prices are stale  securities affected by significant events  and securities that the investment adviser believes were priced incorrectly 

table of contents determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on our consolidated financial statements 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the company has the ability to access 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level inputs include the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets  c pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability examples include most over the counter derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  and d pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability examples include certain of our private debt and equity investments and long dated or complex derivatives including certain equity and currency derivatives 
valuation of million credit facility and senior secured notes the company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to its million credit facility led by citibank million credit facility and its senior secured notes  in accordance with asc we believe accounting for the million credit facility and senior secured notes at fair value will better align the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities  which may mitigate certain earnings volatility 
as a result of this election  approximately million of costs related to the establishment of the million credit facility and senior secured notes was expensed during the year ended december   rather than being deferred and amortized over their stated or expected life 
revenue recognition the company records interest and dividend income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis 
investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and or dividends in cash are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest dividend cash payments are past due days or more and or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest dividend cash payments will be collected 
such non accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash  and in management s judgment  are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest or dividend obligations 
interest or dividend cash payments received on non accrual designated investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
some of our investments may have contractual payment in kind pik interest or dividends 
pik interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional 
table of contents securities received 
pik generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
at the point the company believes pik is not expected to be realized  the pik investment will be placed on non accrual status 
when a pik investment is placed on non accrual status  the accrued  uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income  respectively 
the company does not reverse previously capitalized pik interest or dividends 
upon capitalization  pik is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments 
pik investments on non accrual status are restored to accrual status if the company again believes that pik is expected to be realized 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method or straight line  as applicable 
upon the prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts 
capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we generally measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties 
the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
income taxes solar capital ltd  a us corporation  has elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code  as amended 
in order to qualify as a ric  among other things  the company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a given tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  the company accrues an estimated excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income 
we are also subject to taxes in luxembourg  through solar capital luxembourg i sarl  a wholly owned subsidiary 
under the laws of luxembourg  we pay a corporate income tax and a municipal business tax on our subsidiary s taxable income 
prior to our initial public offering in february  solar capital llc was subject to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt  which is imposed on the business income of every unincorporated business that is carried on in new york city 
the ubt was imposed for each taxable year at a rate of percent of taxable income that is allocable to new york city

table of contents the asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets  less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  divided by all senior securities representing indebtedness 
this asset coverage ratio is multiplied by  to determine the asset coverage per unit 
in order to determine the specific asset coverage per unit for each class of debt  the total asset coverage per unit is allocated based on the amount outstanding in each class of debt at the end of the period 
the amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it

table of contents dividends and distributions the following table reflects the cash dividends and distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock since our initial public offering date declared record date payment date amount fiscal february  march  april  fiscal november  december  january  july  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  total fiscal november  december  december  august  september  october  may  june  july  march  march  april  total fiscal november  december  december  august  september  october  may  june  july  january  march  april  total tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to shareholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
future quarterly dividends  if any  will be determined by our board of directors 
we expect that our dividends and distributions to stockholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income and from net realized capital gains  if any  as applicable 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in 
table of contents income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended december   certain of the investments in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these floating rate investments were primarily based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
additionally  some of these investments have libor floors 
the company also has revolving credit facilities that are based on floating libor 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of december   a hypothetical one percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our earnings by approximately six cents per average share over the next twelve months 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of december   a hypothetical one quarter of one percent decrease in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by approximately two cents per average share over the next twelve months 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the year ended december   we purchased two libor caps on a total of million of notional for years 
if during the three year contract period libor exceeds  we will receive payments from the counterparty equal to the difference between libor and on million 
the cost of the caps was million 
increase decrease in libor increase decrease in net investment income per share per year we also have exposure to foreign currencies australian dollar  canadian dollar and euro through various investments 
these investments are converted into us dollars at the balance sheet date  exposing us to movements in exchange rates 
in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have outstanding borrowings in canadian dollars and euros under our multi currency revolving credit facility at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements
