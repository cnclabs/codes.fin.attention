item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item below 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary statement and risk factors contained in item a above 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september for ease of presentation  september is utilized consistently throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to represent the fiscal year end date 
 and were all week fiscal years 
all date references contained herein relate to our fiscal year unless otherwise stated 
overview and outlook we have a diversified and balanced business  serving both commercial and government markets 
total revenues decreased percent during fiscal year this illustrates our balanced business model as the percent reduction in government systems revenues was largely offset by a percent increase in revenue for our commercial systems business 
despite the overall decline in revenues  net income increased percent and we reported total segment operating margins in excess of percent of revenue 
we also generated operating cash flows of million  representing a percent improvement over last year 
we continued to deploy cash for the benefit of our shareowners by paying dividends of million and repurchasing nearly million shares of common stock  lowering outstanding shares by percent 
earnings per share increased percent to  driven by the favorable impact from our share repurchase program and a lower effective income tax rate that resulted from the reinstatement of the federal research development tax credit 
earnings also benefited from the absence of net restructuring and asset impairment charges that occurred in these benefits  however  were offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs in we generated the following results for total sales of billion diluted earnings per share of operating cash flow of million capital expenditures of million total research and development investment of million looking forward to  we anticipate the following total sales in the range of billion to billion diluted earnings per share in the range of to cash provided by operating activities in the range of million to million capital expenditures of about million total research and development investment of about million total research and development r d investment is comprised of company and customer funded r d expenditures and the net increase in pre production engineering costs capitalized within inventory 
in august  we reached a definitive agreement to acquire arinc incorporated arinc  a portfolio company of the carlyle group  and a leader in communications and information processing solutions for the commercial aviation industry  for billion in cash 
the guidance range excludes the impact of the planned acquisition of arinc  which is expected to close shortly after receiving regulatory approval 
guidance ranges will be updated after the transaction has closed 
we believe our company has a proven ability both to react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans 
we expect market conditions in to be similar to what we experienced during  and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of improved conditions when they arrive 
we expect the sequestration process as mandated by the budget control act of to continue and have incorporated the anticipated impacts into our guidance 
while there is uncertainty in our us defense markets right now  we believe marks the bottom of this defense cycle 
we continue to enhance our international strategies and make proactive adjustments to our cost structure when necessary 
this year  both of our businesses made significant progress on several critical programs 
during  we delivered equipment in support of the first flight of the airbus a and bombardier c series aircraft 
we also achieved on time development of equipment for the kc and kc tanker programs 
in addition  boeing is on track to ramp up production rates beginning in early during  we also secured a position to provide large format flight displays on the boeing max and expanded our content on the a aircraft 
furthermore  we continue to expand our presence internationally as we have captured a number of positions for firestorm targeting systems outside the us and were selected by agustawestland to provide our helisure situational awareness solution on a variety of their helicopter platforms 
we expect our content on these platforms to drive substantial revenue growth in the years to come 
our number one priority is to accelerate our company return to growth through international expansion  building on our core capabilities  and maintaining a strong commitment to innovation 
as we look to and beyond  we intend to continue full speed ahead on the strategic direction that has served us well 
this includes our focus on the customer  continuing our commitment to operational excellence and maintaining our balanced business model 
we will also continue to seek to set ourselves apart with strong customer relationships  high returns on invested capital  strong cash flows and margins and continued investment in market differentiating technologies and programs 
we believe the following strategies will position our company to accelerate our return to growth in the years to come enhance and expand our addressed markets we seek to enhance and expand our product offerings in communications and aviation electronics and leverage our customer relationships and product and technology strengths  as well as industry trends  to provide consistent and profitable growth 
we strive to maintain the right level of balance and diversification  in terms of market segment  geographic regions and product and customer sales mix  believing that our government systems and commercial systems businesses are complementary to one another 
our business structure enables us to rapidly move resources to meet customer needs as they change  and benefit from growth opportunities as they arise 
over the past several years  we have adjusted the balance between our business segments  as about percent of our sales were attributable to the government systems business in  compared to percent in looking forward to  we expect this trend to continue as we anticipate commercial systems to account for over half of our revenues 
grow our international business market opportunities outside the united states continue to evolve  driven by expanding populations and emerging economies 
security needs are on the rise around the globe  as countries seek to protect their borders  infrastructure and resources 
at the same time  global commercial air travel is increasing  generating higher traffic and increased demand for new aircraft 
we believe we have positioned our business to take advantage of this growth and project our international revenues will grow from over one third of revenues today to roughly fifty percent by the end of the decade 
maintain our strong commitment to innovation a well funded and comprehensive r d program is a foundational aspect of our company 
our focus on developing unique solutions to address our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards r d programs 
this investment in r d has allowed us to develop new systems  products and software solutions for our customers which will continue to be a growth engine for our company 
in  we expect to invest approximately million  or over percent of sales  through r d investments 
drive operational excellence operational excellence is a fundamental objective at our company 
we have extended lean concepts beyond the factory floor to virtually every aspect of our business 
our program seeks to streamline processes  reduce production costs and increase quality while enhancing our ability to respond quickly to customer needs 
in addition  our shared service model uses an organizational structure to provide the most efficient mechanism to leverage resources across the business 
this is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays  communication  navigation and surveillance  through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both government systems and commercial systems 
by applying common tools and systems across our businesses  we can better manage our cost structure and maximize our r d investments as technological advancements are applied across our businesses

results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of results of operations is based on reported financial results for through and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item below 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the rollmet product line  formerly included within the commercial systems segment  has been accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
unless otherwise noted  disclosures pertain to our continuing operations 
consolidated financial results sales in millions us non us total percent increase decrease sales are attributed to geographic region based on the location of our customers 
sales for compared to total sales decreased million  or percent  as the million reduction in government systems sales was only partially offset by the million increase in commercial systems sales 
refer to a detailed discussion of sales by segment in and in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
us sales decreased million  or percent  due principally to a reduction in sales to the us government and continued challenges from sequestration  as discussed in the government systems sales section below 
non us sales increased by million  or percent  primarily from higher product deliveries within commercial systems to non us aircraft manufacturers including bombardier and higher sales of firestorm targeting systems and other products on international military programs within government systems 
sales for compared to total sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a million reduction in government systems sales  partially offset by a million increase in commercial systems sales 
refer to a detailed discussion of sales by segment in and in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
us sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to lower sales to the us government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the government systems sales section below  and a reduction in sales to a us business jet manufacturer who declared bankruptcy in this reduction was partially offset by higher sales to boeing across various platforms and increased sales of aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers  as discussed in the commercial systems sales section below 
non us sales increased by million  or percent  as sales to non us aircraft manufacturers including airbus and bombardier increased and aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the us were higher 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in government systems sales to foreign ministries of defense 
cost of sales in millions total cost of sales percent of total sales cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes r d  raw material  labor  facility  product warranty  depreciation  amortization and other related expenses 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million decrease resulting from the million reduction in net sales volume  as discussed in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below million reduction due to the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in the prior year and classified within cost of sales  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements million reduction in company funded r d expense  as explained below the above items were partially offset by other net increases to cost of sales of million  primarily attributable to the combined impact of higher employee incentive compensation costs and the absence of favorable warranty adjustments recorded in the prior year the decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges and the reduction in company funded r d expense  partially offset by the increase in employee incentive compensation costs and higher warranty costs 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million decrease in cost of sales resulting from the million reduction in sales volume  as discussed in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation costs million reduction in company funded r d expense  as explained below above items were partially offset by million increase from higher restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in as compared to for  million of restructuring and asset impairment charges were classified within cost of sales  compared to million in  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements million increase primarily attributable to the combined impact of the million increase in warranty cost detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and higher retirement benefit expenses  as described in the retirement plans section below the decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the lower employee incentive compensation costs and reduction in company funded r d expense 
research and development expense r d expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows in millions customer funded government systems commercial systems total customer funded company funded government systems commercial systems total company funded total research and development expense percent of total sales we make significant investments in research and development to allow our customers to benefit from the latest technological advancements 
total r d expense is comprised of both company funded and customer funded r d expenditures 
in addition to the r d expenditures shown in the table above  we capitalize in inventory the cost of certain pre production engineering effort incurred during the development phase of programs when the customer has provided us a long term supply arrangement and a contractual guarantee for reimbursement 
pre production engineering costs are then amortized over their useful lives 
this amortization cost is included within customer funded r d expense and totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
refer to the research and development section found in item and the critical accounting policies section found in item below for further discussion of our incremental investments in pre production engineering effort 
customer funded r d expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are typically accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
company funded r d expenditures relate to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products and are expensed as incurred  as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
company funded r d expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in r d activities  engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs 
total r d expense decreased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense decreased million from to government systems accounted for million of this decrease as challenging market conditions contributed to a decline in spending by the us government on various development programs 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase within commercial systems of million  driven in part by higher amortization of pre production engineering costs 
the million decrease in company funded r d from to was driven by a million reduction within commercial systems as we completed r d efforts associated with various next generation business jet avionics development programs 
total r d expense decreased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense decreased million from to government systems accounted for million of this decrease  as certain development programs were terminated for convenience by the us government and spending on other programs slowed during a transition out of the development phase into production 
the million decrease in company funded r d from to was also driven by government systems and was attributable to the completion of development efforts for networked communication  airborne communication and navigation products  as well as savings realized from our previously announced decision to cease further discretionary investments in the public safety vehicle product line 
looking forward to  total r d expense is expected to be approximately million  with company funded and customer funded r d expense both expected to be relatively flat when compared to selling  general and administrative expenses in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of total sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or r d activities 
these activities include marketing and business development  finance  legal  information technology and other administrative and management functions 
total sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following the absence of million in bad debt and employee severance expenses that occurred in the remaining net decrease of million was primarily due to the combined impact of a reduction in bid and proposal costs and savings realized from ongoing restructuring actions  partially offset by increases in employee incentive compensation and initial transaction costs from the pending acquisition of arinc total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million due to higher bad debt expense resulting from the write off of accounts receivable due to customer bankruptcies which occurred during partially offset by a million reduction from lower employee incentive compensation and other savings attributable to headcount reduction and restructuring actions interest expense in millions interest expense interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to costs incurred on a bridge loan credit facility that relates to our pending acquisition of arinc 
interest expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to additional interest expense associated with the million of long term debt issued in november of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below for more detail regarding outstanding debt 
other income  net in millions other income  net other income  net decreased by million in compared to  primarily due to an increase in pension expense and the absence of a million gain that occurred in when we sold our irvine  california facility 
for additional information regarding the fluctuations in other income  net  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
income tax expense from continuing operations in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate as detailed below statutory tax rate state and local income taxes research and development credit domestic manufacturing deduction tax settlements other effective income tax rate the difference between our effective income tax rate in and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefits derived from the federal research and development tax credit federal r d tax credit  which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental r d expenditures  and the domestic manufacturing deduction under section dmd  which provides a tax benefit on us based manufacturing 
in january  the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal r d tax credit 
this favorable tax credit had previously expired on december  the effective income tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the favorable impacts from the extension of the federal r d tax credit and an adjustment to recognize certain tax benefits from net operating loss carryovers in the united kingdom 
these items were partially offset by the absence of favorable adjustments recorded in that primarily related to the resolution of the internal revenue service irs examination of taxable years ended september  and the effective income tax rate in increased from primarily due to the differences in the availability of the federal r d tax credit which had expired on december  this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact in of the internal revenue service irs completing its examination of the taxable years ended september  and looking forward to  we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately percent 
this rate assumes the benefit from the federal r d tax credit is only available through december  net income and diluted earnings per share in millions  except per share amounts income from continuing operations percent of sales income from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations diluted earnings per share weighted average diluted common shares net income for increased percent to million from net income of million for diluted earnings per share increased percent to for compared to for the rate of increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the percentage rate increase in net income because of the favorable impact from our share repurchase program 
net income and earnings per share for benefited from higher operating earnings in commercial systems  a lower effective income tax rate and the absence of net restructuring and asset impairment charges that were recorded in these benefits  however  were partially offset by reduced sales volume and operating earnings within government systems and the higher employee incentive compensation costs that were recorded in net income for decreased percent to million from net income of million in diluted earnings per share increased percent to for  compared to for the increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the favorable impact of our share repurchase program 
net income and earnings per share for includes a million charge million before income taxes  or per share  attributable to the net restructuring and asset impairment expenses described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income and earnings per share for includes a million gain million before income taxes  or per share  from the divestiture of the rollmet product line  and also includes an offsetting charge of million million before income taxes  or per share  related to restructuring actions 
net income and earnings per share for benefited from higher operating earnings in commercial systems and a reduction in employee incentive compensation costs 
these benefits were partially offset by higher income tax expense and a reduction in government systems operating earnings 
segment financial results one of the key metrics that we often use to describe year over year changes in operating income for each segment is the incremental or reduced earnings derived from higher or lower sales volumes 
similarly  the gross margin derived from these incremental or reduced earnings is often used to describe changes in segment operating margins 
by leveraging the fixed costs present in our shared service operating model  we typically can deliver higher earnings on incremental sales volumes 
conversely  lower sales volumes require us to control costs in order to sustain profitability 
the incremental or reduced margin realized on the sales volume change tends to be disproportionately higher than the overall operating margin reported for the segment 
this is because the overall operating margin for the segment contemplates more elements of our cost structure  such as company funded r d expense  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
government systems overview and outlook our government systems business provides avionics  communication products  surface solutions and navigation products to the us department of defense  other ministries of defense  other government agencies and defense contractors around the world 
these systems  products and services support airborne fixed and rotary wing  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and non us governments  which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits 
in august  congress enacted the budget control act of which imposes spending caps and certain reductions in us security spending over a ten year period through these spending caps and reductions  referred to as sequestration  went into effect on march  while we believe our product offerings are well positioned to meet the needs of our government customers  the impact of sequestration could have a material adverse effect on our company and the defense industry in general 
further  in years when the us government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year september  government operations are typically funded through a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the us government to continue to operate  but does not authorize new spending initiatives 
during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  we may experience delays in procurement of products and services which can adversely impact our results of operations and cause variability in the timing of revenue between periods 
the us government was not able to agree on a continuing resolution solution prior to the expiration of their most recent fiscal year ended september  as a result  the government began the fiscal year unfunded and as of october   all non essential government personnel and services were shut down 
on october   legislation was passed to reopen the government and to provide temporary funding authority for approximately three months 
federal contracts will continue to face funding uncertainty until congress passes a more definitive spending bill 
our fiscal year guidance for government systems incorporates the estimated continued impacts of sequestration 
we expect government systems revenues to decrease by mid to high single digits from to  primarily driven by approximately million reduction resulting from a full year impact of sequestration cuts partially offset by an increase in international defense sales and increased production on various avionics programs  including kc and e b aircraft upgrades  and higher deliveries for the joint helmet mounted cuing systems jhmcs and joint strike fighter jsf helmet mounted displays we project government systems segment operating margins to remain above percent  as the benefits from restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives should mostly offset the adverse impact from lower revenue 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include overall funding and prioritization of the us and us defense budgets  including unanticipated impacts from sequestration and the uncertain budgetary environment delayed  reduced or canceled funding for programs we have won potential impact of geopolitical and economic events our ability to execute to our internal performance plans and cost reduction initiatives our ability to win new business  successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements for additional disclosure on government systems segment results see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
government systems sales the following table presents government systems sales by product category in millions avionics communication products surface solutions navigation products total percent decrease government systems sales for compared to avionics sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million decrease from the combined impact of our reduced effort on development programs that are completing or are expected to transition to full scale production after  such as the e aircraft upgrade program  and programs that were terminated for convenience by the us government million decrease driven by lower production on the eurofighter program and fewer deliveries of helmet mounted displays for various fighter aircraft million decrease from a reduction in simulator and training activities on programs that have either completed or are winding down partially offset by other net increases to revenue of million  including higher program revenues on international tanker transport aircraft communication products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction from fewer deliveries of satellite communication terminals attributable to the adverse impacts from sequestration and reductions in the us government communication infrastructure in the middle east as troops are withdrawn from the region million decrease from the combined impact of the wind down of development efforts on several secured communication programs  including the fab t family of advanced beyond line of sight terminals program  and a reduction in data link product deliveries on certain programs that are completing or are currently experiencing customer award delays partially offset by other net increases to revenue of million  including higher deliveries of the joint tactical radio system manpack radios surface solutions sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million increase principally attributable to higher international sales of firestorm targeting systems partially offset by a million decrease caused by a reduction in various electronic warfare and integration programs that completed or are transitioning from development to production  and fewer deliveries of public safety vehicle systems as we exited that product line navigation products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to fewer deliveries of our defense advanced gps receiver products as troops are withdrawn from afghanistan and iraq 
government systems sales for compared to avionics sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million increase resulting from the combined impact of development effort on the kc a  kc and kc tanker transport programs million increase in sales on the saudi f fighter program partially offset by reductions to revenue of million  primarily attributable to decreased sales for the kc global air traffic management program and lower deliveries on c transport  ch rotary wing and p special mission aircraft communication products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction due to the completion of a program to provide transportable cellular capabilities in afghanistan million decrease resulting from the combined impact of a program termination for ground mobile radios and reduced funding authorizations on the us department of defense fab t initiative surface solutions sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the following million reduction attributable to the combined impact of two programs that were terminated for convenience by the us government during million decrease resulting from the combined impact of fewer deliveries of iforce public safety vehicle systems as we exited this product line and a reduction in joint precision approach and landing system program revenues as it transitioned from development into production remaining decrease of million was due to a variety of items  including fewer deliveries of soldier optronics products and a decline in electronic warfare solution program revenues navigation products sales decreased million  or percent  primarily due to an million reduction in revenue from fewer deliveries of our defense advanced gps receiver products as troop deployments wind down in afghanistan and iraq 
government systems segment operating earnings in millions segment operating earnings percent of sales government systems operating earnings for compared to government systems operating earnings were million  or percent of sales  for compared to operating earnings of million  or percent of sales  for the million decrease in government systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following the million reduction in sales discussed in the government systems sales section above resulted in lower earnings of million  or percent of the sales decline  and a million decrease to cost million reduction to operating earnings was primarily due to the combined impact of a net increase in employee related costs  including employee incentive compensation  and the absence of favorable warranty adjustments that occurred in partially offset by a million benefit to operating earnings attributable to the combined impact of lower sg a costs as we realized savings from on going restructuring actions and the reduction in company funded r d expense the decrease in government systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was driven by the higher employee incentive compensation and the absence of favorable warranty adjustments that occurred in the unfavorable margin impact from the lower sales volume was mostly offset by the benefits from lower sg a and company funded r d expenses 
government systems operating earnings for compared to government systems operating earnings were million  or percent of sales  for compared to operating earnings of million  or percent of sales  for the million decrease in government systems operating earnings was primarily due to the following million reduction in sales discussed in the government systems sales section above resulted in a million decrease to costs and a reduction to earnings of million  or percent of the sales decline 
this margin reflects the absence of higher margin hardware sales for navigation products that occurred last year partially offset by a million benefit to operating earnings resulting from lower company funded r d expense the remaining variance of million was primarily attributable to a benefit from lower employee headcount and reduced employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by higher warranty expense and an increase in employee medical and retirement benefit costs the increase in government systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was driven by the reduction in company funded r d expense and lower employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by the adverse impact from lower sales 
commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  corporate profits and the financial condition of airlines worldwide 
we expect commercial systems sales to increase by mid single digits in compared to  primarily due to the following sales to aircraft oems are expected to increase by mid single digits when compared to sales to air transport aircraft oems are projected to increase in the low teens and should benefit from anticipated production rate increases for the boeing aircraft and initial sales related to the airbus a aircraft 
business and regional jet oem sales are expected to decrease in the low single digits as initial deliveries of products for the embraer legacy aircraft are expected to only partially offset the impact of lower production rates at cessna aftermarket sales for are expected to increase by mid single digits 
the sales increase is expected to be driven by higher revenue from regulatory airspace mandates  including tcas and link  as airlines and business jet owners continue to incorporate these retrofits onto their aircraft in anticipation of the mandate 
in addition  we expect an increase in service and support revenues and growth from business jet cockpit upgrades  as well as air transport spares for boeing and airbus a aircraft sales of wide body in flight entertainment ife products and services are expected to decrease by about percent  or million  as airlines continue to decommission their legacy ife systems and no longer require our services  given our decision in to cease investing in this product area we project commercial systems operating margins will expand by approximately basis points above the percent reported in  driven primarily by the anticipated revenue increase 
commercial margin expansion will be tempered slightly as a majority of the revenue growth anticipated in results from new air transport aircraft entering into service  which initially generate lower incremental operating margins 
risks to the commercial systems business include turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel  demand for new aircraft  demand for retrofits and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event  including terrorism or a pandemic  that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market segment acceptance of our products and systems potential adverse impact from delays or reductions in oem aircraft production  including delays in the entry into service date for new aircraft for additional disclosure on commercial systems segment results see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

the increase was driven by higher spares revenues of million  primarily for new boeing and aircraft  and a million increase in retrofit and service and support activities wide body ife sales decreased million  or percent  as airlines begin decommissioning their legacy ife systems and no longer require our services  given the company strategic decision announced in to cease investment in this product area total business and regional aviation electronics sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following oem sales increased million  or percent  primarily related to a million increase in product deliveries for bombardier global  cessna citation and gulfstream aircraft 
this was partially offset by other net reductions of million  including fewer deliveries to hawker beechcraft as they discontinued their hawker jet product line  and lower sales to regional jet aircraft manufacturers as production rates declined for certain aircraft aftermarket sales increased million  or percent  driven by the combined impact of higher retrofit and service and support activities 
retrofit sales increased as customers upgraded aircraft systems in order to gain operational efficiencies  improve performance and modernize the cabin commercial systems segment operating earnings in millions segment operating earnings percent of sales commercial systems operating earnings for compared to commercial systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following the million increase to sales discussed in the commercial systems sales section above resulted in a million increase to cost and incremental earnings of million  or percent of the higher sales volume 
the margins on the incremental earnings were tempered by a less favorable sales mix million benefit related to lower company funded r d expenses partially offset by other net reductions to operating earnings of million  driven principally by higher employee incentive compensation costs the increase in commercial systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was primarily due to the reduction in company funded r d expenses and the higher sales volume  partially offset by the adverse impact from increased employee incentive compensation 
commercial systems operating earnings for compared to commercial systems operating earnings increased million  or percent  primarily due to the following incremental earnings from higher sales volume totaled million  representing an incremental gross margin of percent partially offset by a million reduction to operating earnings due to the absence of favorable adjustments recorded in the prior year to reduce certain customer incentive reserves remaining variance of million is primarily comprised of a net benefit from lower employee incentive compensation costs  partially offset by a million bad debt charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal year and higher warranty  employee medical and retirement benefit costs the increase in commercial systems operating earnings as a percent of sales was primarily due to the incremental earnings from higher sales volume 
general corporate  net general corporate expenses that are not allocated to our business segments are included in general corporate  net 
these costs are included within cost of sales  sg a and other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
general corporate  net is summarized as follows in millions general corporate  net general corporate  net expense increased million during as compared to primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation and pension costs and an increase from initial transaction costs related to our planned acquisition of arinc 
general corporate  net expense decreased million during as compared to primarily due to a reduction in employee incentive compensation costs 
retirement plans net benefit expense income for pension benefits and other retirement benefits are as follows in millions pension benefits other retirement benefits net benefit expense income pension benefits in  we amended our us qualified and non qualified pension plans covering all salary and hourly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements to discontinue benefit accruals for salary increases and services rendered after september  concurrently  we replaced this benefit by supplementing our existing defined contribution savings plan to include an additional company contribution effective october  the supplemental contribution to our existing defined contribution savings plan was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
defined benefit pension expense income for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in pension expense in as compared to was impacted by a decrease in our expected long term return on plan assets assumption  from percent in to percent in pension costs did not change significantly in compared to during  the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of  million at september  to a deficit of million at september  the improvement in funded status was primarily due to the favorable impact from an increase in the discount rate used to measure our us pension obligations from percent at september  to percent at september   and an increase in plan assets due to improved market returns during we also contributed million to our pension plans during the year ended september  we expect defined benefit pension expense of million in  compared to million of pension expense in our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
in october  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we made a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan 
there was no minimum statutory funding requirement for and we do not currently expect to make any additional discretionary contributions during to this plan 
any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates 
contributions to our non us plans and our non us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits other retirement benefits expense for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately million in financial condition and liquidity cash flow summary our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners 
the timing of our cash inflows is historically heavily weighted towards the second half of our fiscal year  particularly our fourth quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations  a percent increase over we also made million of pension plan contributions during and incurred significant cash expenditures to enhance shareowner value  including million of cash payments for share repurchases and million of dividend payments 
in we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of million to million 
the projected range of cash provided by operating activities accommodates a million discretionary contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan that was made in october  subsequent to our fiscal year end  and also accommodates a projected net increase in pre production engineering costs of million 
we expect a majority of the projected operating cash flow to be generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash payments for income taxes decreased million to million in compared to million in this benefit to operating cash flows was primarily due to differences in the timing of tax payments resulting from favorable changes in the availability of the federal r d tax credit payments for employee incentive pay decreased million 
incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and is paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during this compares to million paid in for employee incentive pay costs incurred during payments for inventory and other operating costs decreased by million to  million in compared to  million in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the lower sales volume in  as discussed in the results of operations section above the above items were partially offset by lower cash receipts from customers which decreased by million to  million in  compared to  million in the net decrease was primarily due to the lower sales volume  partially offset by higher cash advances received from customers the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash receipts from customers decreased by million to  million in compared to  million in  primarily due to the lower sales volume in as discussed in the results of operations section above and lower collections of receivables from customers  partially offset by higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognition payments for income taxes increased million to million in compared to million in due to the differences in the timing of cash tax payments resulting from the retroactive extension of the federal r d tax credit that benefited and the expiration of the federal r d tax credit that increased cash payments in payments for employee incentive pay increased million 
incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during as compared to million paid in for employee incentive pay costs incurred during the above items were partially offset by a decrease in payments for inventory and other operating costs of million to  million in compared to  million in the decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the lower sales volume in discussed in the results of operations section above investing activities in millions cash used for investing activities the million reduction in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash payments for capital expenditures decreased million partially offset by the absence of cash proceeds received last year from the sale of our facility in irvine  california the million increase in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following the absence of million in cash proceeds from the divestiture of rollmet  which occurred in the absence of million in cash proceeds from the sale of a short term investment at a non us subsidiary during partially offset by lower payments for the acquisition of businesses of million 
in  there were no business acquisitions as compared to million of payments made in for the acquisitions of blue ridge simulation  inc and computing technologies for aviation  inc 
a million decrease in capital expenditures financing activities in millions cash used for financing activities the million reduction in cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash repurchases of common stock decreased million to million in  compared to million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises increased million to million in  as our common stock price generally increased during the year and a greater number of options were exercised partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings of million

as such  this item is reflected as a non cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
looking forward to  we expect share count to remain fairly stable and anticipate some level of share repurchases to occur in order to offset the dilution from employee stock benefits 
dividends we declared and paid cash dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
financial condition and liquidity we maintain a capital structure that enables us sufficient access to credit markets 
when combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations  this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners 
a comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of september  and are as follows september in millions cash and cash equivalents short term debt long term debt  net net debt total equity debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization short term debt at september  includes million of short term commercial paper borrowings  million of unsecured debt due december  the notes and a million fair value swap adjustment related to the notes calculated as total of short term and long term debt  net total debt  less cash and cash equivalents calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity calculated as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total equity we primarily fund our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities 
in august  we reached a definitive agreement to acquire arinc for billion in cash 
the transaction is expected to close during our fiscal year upon completion of government regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
we expect to fund the acquisition purchase price through the incurrence of new debt  with approximately two thirds allocated as long term in order to take advantage of the currently favorable interest rate environment 
the balance of the purchase price will be funded with commercial paper  which we intend to pay down using our cash flow 
while this incremental debt resulting from the pending acquisition of arinc will increase our leverage  we expect to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and have continued access to the credit markets 
as of september   approximately percent of our cash and cash equivalents resides at non us locations and may not be readily accessible for use in the us due to potential adverse income tax implications and other statutory limitations 
due to the fluctuations of cash flows  we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than days from the date of issuance 
at september   short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding were million with a weighted average interest rate and maturity period of percent and days  respectively 
in addition to the commercial paper borrowings  short term debt at september  also includes million of percent fixed rate unsecured debt due december  our current plan is to refinance the notes 
at september   there were no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
the maximum amount of short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding during was million and the maximum amount outstanding during was million 
in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired  we have access to our existing million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into on may  and has a term of five years 
this revolving credit facility is in place principally to support our commercial paper program 
the credit facility includes one financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent 
the ratio excludes the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  based on this financial covenant was percent 
we had no borrowings at september  under our existing revolving credit facility 
the company has entered into two new revolving credit agreements to ensure we will have adequate commercial paper borrowing capacity to finance a portion of the pending arinc acquisition and to fund other short term cash requirements 
these credit agreements will not become effective until the closing conditions described below for each agreement are fulfilled 
in september  we entered into a billion five year unsecured revolving credit agreement with various banks to extend the term and increase the size of our existing million revolving credit facility 
the initial borrowing under this new five year revolving credit agreement is subject to customary closing conditions as well as  among other conditions  the payoff and termination of our existing million five year senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 
the initial borrowing is not subject to the consummation of the arinc acquisition  however in the event the arinc acquisition is not consummated  the aggregate principal amount available under this new agreement will be lowered from billion to million 
in september  we also entered into a million day unsecured revolving credit agreement with various banks 
the initial borrowing under the day revolving credit agreement is subject to customary closing conditions as well as  among other conditions  the consummation of the arinc acquisition 
this credit agreement will automatically terminate in the event the arinc acquisition is not consummated 
as of september   the closing conditions under the billion credit agreement and the million credit agreement have not been satisfied 
we expect to satisfy the conditions precedent to the closing of these credit agreements substantially concurrent with the consummation of the arinc acquisition 
the covenants  representations and warranties and events of default set forth in the new revolving credit agreements are substantially the same as those in the existing million credit agreement 
in addition  alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities  debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
to date  we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities  nor do we have any current plans to do so  as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing 
our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets 
if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook fitch ratings f a stable moody s investors service p a negative standard poor s a a negative when the company announced its intent to acquire arinc and fund the purchase price through the incurrence of additional debt  each of the above rating agencies placed our credit ratings under review for possible downgrade 
in october  subsequent to our fiscal year end  fitch affirmed our current short term and long term ratings  but revised our outlook to negative from stable 
standard poor announced that it expects to reduce the company short term and long term ratings to a and to a  respectively  upon completion of the arinc acquisition 
moody continues to have the company ratings under review for possible downgrade 
we do not expect any of the changes to our credit ratings or outlook to materially impact our ability to access credit markets or significantly increase our cost of borrowing 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september  and september  off balance sheet arrangements as of september   other than operating leases  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our consolidated statement of financial position or variable interests in entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to our company 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of september   as well as when these obligations are expected to be satisfied 
payments due by period in millions total less than year years years thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations purchase orders purchase contracts total interest payments under long term debt obligations exclude the potential effects of the related interest rate swap contracts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
we lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases 
our commitments under these operating leases  in the form of non cancelable future lease payments  are not reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of financial position 
purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts 
purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable 
purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need 
generally  items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
in october  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we contributed million to our us qualified pension plan  which fully satisfies the minimum statutory funding requirements for for years beyond  the actual amounts required to be contributed to our us qualified pension plan are dependent upon  among other things  interest rates and underlying asset returns 
with the exception of certain bargaining unit plans  payments due under other post retirement benefit plans are funded as the expenses are incurred 
in addition  the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million at september   as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the following table reflects certain of our commercial commitments as of september  amount of commitment expiration by period in millions total amount committed less than year years years thereafter letters of credit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for a discussion of letters of credit 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we occasionally enter into offset agreements  required by certain customers in some non us countries  as a condition to obtaining contract awards for our products and services 
these agreements  which generally extend over several years  are customary in our industry and are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the country in which our customers operate 
these commitments may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transfer of technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  strategic alliances and transactions conducted by third parties eg  our vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies and or services  building or leasing facilities for in country operations  in country employment of a non us country citizens and other forms of assistance in the applicable country 
the offset rules and regulations  as well as the underlying contracts  may differ from one country to another 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until contract awards for our products or services are definitive 
should we be unable to meet the offset obligations we may be subject to contractual penalties  and our chances of receiving additional business from the applicable customers could be reduced or  in certain cases  eliminated 
we historically have not been required to pay material penalties related to offset obligations and are currently in compliance with our offset commitments 
at september   we had outstanding offset obligations totaling approximately million that extend through the amounts ultimately applied against our offset requirements are based on negotiations with the customer and the cost to fulfill the obligation is typically only a fraction of the original obligation above

environmental for information related to environmental claims  remediation efforts and related matters  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 
approximately percent of our sales are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately  depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates did not have a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended september   or program investments we defer certain pre production engineering costs in inventories  net and record up front sales incentives in intangible assets collectively referred to as program investments 
these program investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to a maximum of years 
estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
this provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit 
the following provides an overview of the program investments september in millions pre production engineering costs up front sales incentives total program investments we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of a program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers 
these customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer 
these costs are deferred in inventories  net to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a units of delivery method  up to years 
this amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis and begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
the estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee  and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement  are expensed as incurred 
we also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized using a units of delivery method over the period we have received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives  up to years 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
amortization begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales  whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales 
risks inherent in recovering the value of our program investments include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program 
in particular  the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions  which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors  the availability of specialized materials and other production risks we evaluate the carrying amount of program investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program 
no impairment charges related to program investments were recorded in  or while we believe our program investments are recoverable over time  the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to program investments 
due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment required to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry  we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly canceling a program is remote 
we also evaluate our amortization of program investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
the impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the program investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis 
there were no significant changes in the rate of program investment amortization and no significant cumulative adjustments recorded in  and amortization expense for pre production engineering costs and up front sales incentives for  and was as follows in millions amortization of pre production engineering amortization of up front sales incentives total amortization of program investments as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for pre production engineering costs is approximately nine years 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for up front sales incentives is approximately ten years 
anticipated amortization expense for the program investments recorded on our balance sheet at september   for fiscal years and beyond is summarized below in millions thereafter anticipated amortization expense for pre production engineering costs anticipated amortization expense for up front sales incentives total anticipated amortization for program investments pre production engineering costs comprise percent of our total inventory balance at september   compared to percent in the prior year 
pre production engineering costs increased million from september  to september  the majority of this increase was attributable to a million increase within commercial systems  driven by increased spending on programs with airbus  bombardier and boeing 
the remaining increase of million was within government systems 
additionally  up front sales incentives to commercial systems customers increased million from september  to september  growth in our program investments continues to be driven by the expanded market share our company successfully captured over the past several years 
commercial systems has secured positions on several key platforms in the air transport market  including the boeing max and airbus a in the business and regional jet market  our pro line fusion avionics system has been selected by customers around the globe  including bombardier  embraer and gulfstream 
our customers have provided us a contractual guarantee for reimbursement on several of these programs  as such  our capitalized pre production engineering costs have increased for these programs as the company continues development efforts 
our government systems business has also contributed to the growth in pre production engineering costs as we continue to perform on several international rotary wing programs 
we expect the long term supply arrangements resulting from these recent program wins to deliver significant revenues and profits to us over the next several years  continuing over the life of the aircraft platforms which can range from ten to twenty years  as such  we believe our program investments are recoverable 
income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and  to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income  except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and primarily relate to foreign net operating losses 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits  deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are generally determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
in  we adopted new accounting guidance which allows companies the option of making an initial qualitative evaluation to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
depending on the results of the qualitative evaluation  additional quantitative analysis may not be required 
we adopted this guidance in and  based upon our qualitative analysis  concluded no impairment of goodwill exists 
in reaching this conclusion  certain financial information was reviewed  including our five year strategic operating plan  and certain judgments were required  including projections about future business conditions in our industry and our ability to compete 
our annual goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of  and yielded no impairments 
in addition  based upon the results of our impairment testing  none of our reporting units were at risk of their carrying value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value 
if there were a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms 
as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs has declined million from a balance of million at september   to a balance of million at september  this trend is driven by a variety of factors 
approximately million of the decrease in our accrued warranty balance from to is attributable to favorable adjustments recorded in  and to reduce warranty reserves for changes in estimates  as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
these reductions were principally driven by the completion of certain government systems programs that no longer require a warranty and a favorable impact from lower than anticipated repair costs across various product areas 
the remaining decline from to is attributable to the commercial systems business 
a primary source of warranty risk for commercial systems in the past related to sales of wide body in flight entertainment products and systems 
as discussed in the commercial systems results of operations section above  sales related to wide body ife have declined significantly over the past several years due to the company previously announced decision to cease investing in this product area 
as sales volumes related to wide body ife continue to decline  our warranty reserve balance has also been reduced 
product reliability improvements have also favorably impacted incurred warranty costs within commercial systems  contributing to a lower warranty reserve 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense 
the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
in  we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets by basis points  down to percent from the percent used in this reduction in our expected rate of return assumption increased pension expense in holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension expense and pension benefit obligation for our us plans caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows in millions change in assumption assumption basis point increase basis point decrease pension obligation discount rate pension projected benefit obligation decrease pension projected benefit obligation increase pension obligation discount rate pension expense increase pension expense decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets pension expense decrease pension expense increase inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior  although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory 
life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of our products 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 
excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments  we had million of gross inventory on hand at september  with million of inventory valuation reserves 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pre production engineering costs are discussed in the program investments section of our critical accounting policies above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in november we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less 
percent by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
at september   we also had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in january we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt based on six month libor plus percent
