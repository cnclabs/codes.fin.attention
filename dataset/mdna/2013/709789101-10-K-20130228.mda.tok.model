table of contents the following discussion and analysis of peoples consolidated financial statements is presented to provide insight into management assessment of the financial results and condition for the periods presented 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as the ratios and statistics  contained elsewhere in this form k 
summary of significant transactions and events the following is a summary of transactions or events that have impacted or are expected by management to impact peoples results of operations or financial condition during the second quarter of  peoples became more active with its merger and acquisition activities 
these activities included the merger transactions with sistersville bancorp  inc sistersville and its wholly owned subsidiary  first federal savings bank  announced on june  and subsequently completed on september   and the purchase of a small financial advisory book of business in wood county  west virginia 
in the third quarter of  peoples purchased another small financial advisory book of business in gallipolis  ohio 
these transactions are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  peoples management team continues to evaluate other acquisition opportunities involving banks  insurance agencies and wealth management providers located in ohio  west virginia and kentucky 
on january   peoples insurance acquired a commercial insurance agency office and related customer accounts in the pikeville  kentucky area 
in  peoples incurred  of acquisition related expenses  primarily fees for legal costs  other professional services  deconversion costs and write offs associated with assets acquired 
approximately a quarter of these costs related to acquisition opportunities that management determined did not meet peoples criteria and thus negotiations were terminated prior to completion 
on september   peoples introduced its new brand as part of a company wide brand revitalization 
the brand is peoples promise  which is a guarantee of satisfaction and quality 
costs associated with rebranding efforts were approximately  during peoples will continue to incur costs throughout associated with the brand revitalization  including marketing due to advertisement  and depreciation for the revitalization of our branch network 
during  peoples increased the quarterly dividend declared to common shareholders by 
the dividend declared in first quarter of was and the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of was  compared to the quarterly dividend of that was declared during as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  peoples incurred settlement charges of  during due to the aggregate amount of lump sum distributions to participants in peoples defined benefit pension plan exceeding the threshold for recognizing such charges during the second quarter 
settlement charges of  were recognized during the as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  peoples repaid the entire million outstanding principal amount of its junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities on december  the trust preferred redemption 
this transaction resulted in peoples incurring a pre tax loss of million for the redemption premium and unamortized issuance costs 
peoples funded the repayment with a term note from an unaffiliated financial institution at a significantly lower interest rate 
as a result  peoples will realize an annual interest expense savings of million beginning in in the first quarter of  peoples prepaid million of wholesale borrowings using short term funds  which resulted in prepayment charges of million 
these borrowings had an average cost of and consisted of both term repurchase agreements and advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
the impact of the prepayment charges on first quarter earnings was offset by million in gains from the sale of million in investment securities 
the securities sold were primarily mortgage backed securities issued by us government sponsored agencies 
the proceeds from the sale of these investment securities were reinvested into other securities with similar duration  credit risk and yield 
in  peoples received million of new equity capital under the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
the investment was in the form of newly issued non voting cumulative perpetual preferred shares and a related year warrant to purchase common shares sold by peoples to the us treasury the tarp capital investment 
on february   peoples repurchased million of the preferred shares held by the us treasury and the remaining million were repurchased on december  collectively  the tarp capital redemption 
on february   peoples completed the repurchase of the warrant for an aggregate price of 
table of contents million  which was recognized as a direct reduction in the common stock component of peoples stockholders equity 
since the second quarter of  peoples has experienced generally improving trends in several asset quality metrics  after a three year trend of higher credit losses and nonperforming assets than peoples long term historical levels 
additionally  the amount of criticized loans has decreased due in part to peoples upgrading the loan quality ratings of various commercial loans 
these conditions have resulted in lower provisions for loan losses 
peoples net interest income and margin are impacted by changes in market interest rates based upon actions taken by the federal reserve board either directly or through its open market committee 
these actions include changing its target federal funds rate the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other  discount rate the interest rate charged to banks for money borrowed from the federal reserve bank and longer term market interest rates primarily us treasury securities 
longer term market interest rates also are affected by the demand for us treasury securities 
the resulting changes in the yield curve slope have a direct impact on reinvestment rates for peoples earning assets 
the federal reserve board has maintained its target federal funds rate at a historically low level of to since december and has maintained the discount rate at since december the federal reserve board continues to indicate there is the potential for these short term rates to remain unchanged until early since late  the federal reserve board has taken various actions to lower longer term market interest rates as a means of stimulating the economy a policy commonly referred to as quantitative easing 
these actions have included the buying and selling of mortgage backed and other debt securities through its open market operations 
as a result  the slope of the us treasury yield curve has fluctuated significantly 
substantial flattening occurred in late  in mid and since early third quarter of  while moderate steepening occurred in the second half of and late the impact of these transactions  where material  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of peoples conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap and to general practices within the financial services industry 
a summary of significant accounting policies is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
while all of these policies are important to understanding the consolidated financial statements  certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment and make estimates or assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates or assumptions 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in the policies  are critical to an understanding of peoples consolidated financial statements and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
income recognition interest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding  including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities 
since mortgage backed securities comprise a sizable portion of peoples investment portfolio  a significant increase in principal payments on those securities could impact interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization or discount accretion 
management analysis at december  showed changes in prepayments could cause an approximately basis point change in peoples net interest margin from quarter to quarter 
peoples discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when conditions cause management to believe collection of all or any portion of the loan contractual interest is doubtful 
such conditions may include the borrower being days or more past due on any contractual payments or current information regarding the borrower financial condition and repayment ability 
all unpaid accrued interest deemed uncollectible is reversed  which would reduce peoples net interest income 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 

table of contents allowance for loan losses in general  determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and estimation of the losses that are probable of occurrence within the loan portfolio 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and the resulting provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses  including specific losses  levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  current national and local economic conditions  volume  growth and composition of the portfolio  regulatory guidance and other relevant factors 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through peoples bank credit administration department and loan loss committee to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management formal analysis 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management estimate of probable losses from existing loans 
management evaluates lending relationships deemed to be impaired on an individual basis and makes specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses for each relationship based on discounted cash flows using the loan initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
for all other loans  management evaluates pools of homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and makes general allocations for each loan pool based upon historical loss experience 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the allowance is available for all loan losses 
this evaluation of individual impaired loans requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  which consist primarily of loans placed on nonaccrual status  restructured or internally classified as substandard or doubtful 
these reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria  including the size of the loan  the loan cash flow characteristics  loan quality ratings  value of collateral  repayment ability of borrowers  and historical experience factors 
allowances for homogeneous loans are evaluated based upon historical loss experience  adjusted for qualitative risk factors  such as trends in losses and delinquencies  growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market 
as part of the process of identifying the pools of homogenous loans  management takes into account any concentrations of risk within any portfolio segment  including any significant industrial concentrations 
consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans  the allowance relating to the overdraft privilege program is based upon management monthly analysis of accounts in the program 
this analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts  including historical loss experience and length of overdraft 
there can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses  but management believes the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available 
while management uses available information to estimate losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio  and the need for future additions to the allowance  will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors 
as such  adverse changes in economic activity could reduce currently estimated cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  which would likely cause peoples to experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans in the future 
investment securities peoples investment portfolio accounted for of total assets at december   of which approximately of the securities were classified as available for sale 
correspondingly  peoples carries these securities at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  both the investment and equity sections of peoples consolidated balance sheet are sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio  due to changes in market interest rates  investor confidence and other factors affecting market values 
while temporary changes in the fair value of available for sale securities are not recognized in earnings  peoples is required to evaluate all investment securities with an unrealized loss on a quarterly basis to identify potential other than temporary impairment otti losses 
this analysis requires management to consider various factors that involve judgment and estimation  including duration and magnitude of the decline in value  the financial condition of the issuer or pool of issuers and structure of the security 
under current us gaap  an otti loss is recognized in earnings only when peoples intends to sell the debt security  it is more likely than not that peoples will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or peoples does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security 
in situations where peoples intends to sell or when it is more likely than not that peoples will be required to sell the debt security  the entire otti loss must be recognized in earnings 
in all other situations  only the portion of the otti losses 
table of contents representing the credit loss must be recognized in earnings  with the remaining portion being recognized in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
prior to the second quarter of  if peoples determined a loss to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss was recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
additional information regarding impairment losses recognized can be found later in this discussion under the caption net impairment losses 
goodwill and other intangible assets during and in prior years  peoples recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized but is tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist  or at least annually 
peoples other intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangible assets  including core deposit intangibles  representing the present value of future net income to be earned from acquired customer relationships with definite useful lives  which are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the value of recorded goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and peoples ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
potential goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of the reporting unit as defined by us gaap is less than its carrying value 
an impairment loss is recognized in earnings only when the carrying amount of goodwill is less than its implied fair value 
peoples performs its required annual impairment test as of june each year 
the significant assumptions made by management in estimating the reporting unit fair value were level of future cash flows over the next five years  long term growth rate of cash flows after year five and the discount rate 
at june   management analysis concluded that the estimated fair value of peoples single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the analysis also indicated any of the following situations would cause a decline in the fair value of peoples reporting unit below its book value a sustained decline in future cash flows or a basis point increase in the discount rate 
peoples is required to perform interim tests for goodwill impairment in subsequent quarters if events occur or circumstances change that indicate potential goodwill impairment exists  such as adverse changes to peoples business or a significant decline in peoples market capitalization 
at december   peoples market capitalization was less than its book value  which management considered to be an indicator of possible goodwill impairment 
since june   there has been improvement in loan related credit losses over prior periods which management expects will continue to have a positive impact on peoples future cash flows 
additionally  the day moving average of the stock price of peoples common shares improved between june and december  management considered these improvements to be evidence that goodwill is not impaired as of december  peoples records mortgage servicing rights msrs in connection with its mortgage banking activities  which are intangible assets representing the right to service loans sold to third party investors 
these intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans sold 
msrs are stratified based on their predominant risk characteristics and assessed for impairment at the strata level at each reporting date based on their fair value 
at december   management concluded no portion of the recorded msrs was impaired since the fair value exceeded the carrying value 
however  future events  such as a significant increase in prepayment speeds  could result in a fair value that is less than the carrying amount  which would require the recognition of an impairment loss in earnings 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method of accounting  which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
in general  peoples records deferred tax assets when the event giving rise to the tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax asset that  based upon available information  it is more likely than not all  or any portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
assessing the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in most cases  the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon peoples generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods  which can be difficult to predict 
peoples largest 
table of contents deferred tax assets involve differences related to peoples allowance for loan losses and realization of income tax credits received from peoples investments in low income housing projects and funds 
given the nature of peoples deferred tax assets  management determined no valuation allowances were needed at either december  or the calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by peoples and the various tax authorities 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  peoples is involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions taken by peoples in its tax returns 
uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial at both december  and management believes it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns  although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty 
consequently  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements 
fair value measurements as a financial services company  the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities is impacted by the application of fair value measurements  either directly or indirectly 
in certain cases  an asset or liability is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis  such as available for sale investment securities 
in other cases  management must rely on estimates or judgments to determine if an asset or liability not measured at fair value warrants an impairment write down or whether a valuation reserve should be established 
given the inherent volatility  the use of fair value measurements may have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets or liabilities  or result in material changes to the consolidated financial statements  from period to period 
detailed information regarding fair value measurements can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of those assets and liabilities that may be affected by fair value measurements  as well as a brief description of the current accounting practices and valuation methodologies employed by peoples available for sale investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis 
for most securities  the fair value is based upon quoted market prices level or determined by pricing models that consider observable market data level 
for structured investment securities  the fair value often must be based upon unobservable market data  such as non binding broker quotes and discounted cash flow analysis or similar models  due to the absence of an active market for these securities level 
as a result  management determination of fair value for these securities is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  which could change materially between periods 
management occasionally uses information from independent third party consultants in its determination of the fair value of more complex structured investment securities 
at december   all of peoples available for sale investment securities were measured using observable market data 
at december   the majority of the investment securities with level fair values were determined using information provided by third party pricing services 
management reviews the fair values provided by these third parties on a monthly basis and challenges prices when it believes a discrepancy in pricing exists 
management also reviews the valuation methodology and quality controls utilized by the pricing services in their overall assessment of the reasonableness of the fair values provided 
to the extent available  management utilizes an independent third party pricing source to assist in its assessment of the values provided by its primary pricing services 
management challenges third party valuations for any security where it believes a material difference in pricing exists 
based on peoples past experience  these challenges more often than not result in the third party adjusting its valuation of the security 
impaired loans for loans considered impaired  the amount of impairment loss recognized is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral 
management typically relies on the fair value of the underlying collateral due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the borrower ability to make future payments 
the vast majority of the collateral securing impaired loans is real estate  
table of contents although the collateral may also include accounts receivable and equipment  inventory or similar personal property 
the fair value of the collateral used by management represents the estimated proceeds to be received from the sale of the collateral  less costs incurred during the sale  based upon observable market data or market value data provided by independent  licensed or certified appraisers 
goodwill the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves highly subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of peoples reporting unit and  in some cases  goodwill itself 
as a result  changes to these judgments  estimates and assumptions in future periods could result in materially different results 
peoples currently possesses a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
while quoted market prices exist for peoples common shares since they are publicly traded  these market prices do not necessarily reflect the value associated with gaining control of an entity 
thus  management takes into account all appropriate fair value measurements in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
these measurements include transaction prices of recently acquired institutions based upon multiples of book value or earnings and discounted cash flow analysis 
for peoples june  goodwill impairment test  management estimated the fair value of peoples reporting unit using both an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach consisted of a discounted cash flow analysis of projected future earnings 
the market approach was based upon multiples of book value of recently acquired financial institutions  including distressed institutions 
the discount rate used represented the estimated cost of peoples common equity based upon observable market data 
the fair values derived under both approaches were weighted to arrive at an overall estimated fair value 
management placed greater weight on the income approach due to the limited number of acquisitions occurring in involving healthy or non distressed entities compared to prior years 
consequently  the estimated fair value of peoples reporting unit could be materially different in future periods due to changes in either projected future earnings or the cost of common equity 
the measurement of any actual impairment loss requires management to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and separately identifiable intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets from the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of net tangible assets is calculated using the methodologies described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
customer relationship intangibles are the only separately identifiable intangible assets included in the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the amount of these intangibles represents the present value of the future earnings stream attributable to the deposit relationships 
mortgage servicing rights msrs are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market value  and  therefore  can be subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis 
msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices 
thus  management determines fair value based upon a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income provided by an independent third party consultant 
this valuation model is affected by various input factors  such as servicing costs  expected prepayment speeds and discount rates  which are subject to change between reporting periods 
as a result  significant changes to these factors could result in a material change to the calculated fair value of msrs 
executive summary net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in  representing earnings per diluted common share of  and  respectively 
the higher earnings in both and were largely attributable to the impact of continued asset quality improvement 
peoples also generated positive operating leverage during as growth in total revenue was larger than the growth in total non interest expenses 
in  peoples had a recovery of loan losses of million as several asset quality metrics maintained favorable trends 
the favorable trends resulted in net charge offs of million for  which were significantly less than the amounts recorded in and due largely to higher recoveries in in comparison  peoples recorded provision for loan losses of million for and million for these provisions represented amounts needed to maintain the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents net interest income and margin were relatively stable in compared to  due to the reduction in interest income being offset by the reduction of interest expense 
the slight net interest margin compression was a result of long term interest rates remaining at historically low levels 
net interest income decreased to million in compared to  as the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment and lower average loan balances caused a decline in interest income that exceeded the reduction in funding costs 
net interest margin remained relatively even through total non interest income  which excludes gains and losses on investment securities  asset disposals and other transactions  was up in compared to  as strong revenue generation occurred in several major sources 
the most notable growth occurred in mortgage banking income  which grew million  or  over the prior year due to increased refinancing activity 
in  total non interest income increased compared to  as growth occurred in virtually every major revenue category 
the largest growth in was in electronic banking income  which increased  or 
total non interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of over the prior year 
this increase was primarily caused by additional sales and incentive compensation of million  which was a result of the improved financial performance of peoples 
acquisition related costs of  and rebranding costs of  also contributed to the increase over the prior year 
in  non interest expense increased compared to  due to higher salary and employee benefit costs 
other operating expenses were generally controlled in as reduced fdic insurance costs and foreclosed real estate and other loan costs offset the additional marketing expense and higher professional fees  primarily external legal and consulting services 
at december   total assets were up to billion versus billion at year end  with the increase due mostly to higher net loan balances 
gross portfolio loan balances grew million during  most of which was due to the loans acquired in the sistersville acquisition 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million to million  or of gross loans  compared to million and at december  total investment securities grew to million at december   compared to million at the prior year end 
total liabilities were billion at december   up million since december  retail deposit balances experienced continued growth during  increasing million compared to year end the sistersville acquisition added million of interest bearing deposits  almost equally divided among certificates of deposits  money market and savings accounts  and million of non interest bearing deposits 
non interest bearing deposits comprised of total retail deposits at december  versus at year end at december   total borrowed funds were million  down million compared to the prior year end  as peoples repaid million in long term borrowings during the first quarter 
at december   total stockholders equity was million  up million since december  earnings exceeded dividends declared by million 
regulatory capital ratios remained significantly higher than well capitalized minimums 
peoples tier common capital ratio increased to at december   versus at december   while the total risk based capital ratio was versus at december  the decrease in the total risk based capital ratio was largely the result of peoples repaying all of its outstanding junior subordinated debentures and redeeming the related trust preferred securities during the fourth quarter 
in addition  peoples tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was and tangible book value per share was at december   versus and at december   respectively 
results of operations interest income and expense peoples earns interest income on loans and investments and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
the amount of net interest income earned by peoples is affected by various factors  including changes in market interest rates due to the federal reserve board monetary policy  the level and degree of pricing competition for both loans and deposits in peoples markets and the amount and composition of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
peoples monitors net interest income performance and manages its balance sheet composition through regular asset liability management committee alco meetings 
the asset liability management process employed by the alco is intended to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on peoples net interest income and earnings 
however  the

presented on a fully tax equivalent basis 
as part of the analysis of net interest income  management converts tax exempt income earned on obligations of states and political subdivisions to the pre tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 
management believes the resulting fully tax equivalent fte net interest income allows for a more meaningful comparison of tax exempt income and yields to their taxable equivalents 
net interest margin  which is calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets  serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the volume  mix and pricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents the following table details the calculation of fte net interest income for the years ended december dollars in thousands net interest income  as reported taxable equivalent adjustments fully tax equivalent net interest income the yield curve remained relatively flat and interest rates remained low during  which placed greater downward pressure on peoples net interest income and margin 
the yield on investment securities declined further in  as the impact of lower reinvestment rates was magnified by higher levels of principal pre payments within mortgage backed securities 
during  the average monthly principal cash flow received by peoples from its investment portfolio was approximately million  compared to a monthly average of approximately million in the cash flow received from the investment portfolio in had an average yield of and was reinvested in securities with a yield in the range of to 
similar conditions within peoples loan portfolio resulted in total asset yields declining by basis points during the year 
peoples funding costs benefited from the extinguishment of million of higher cost wholesale borrowings in the first quarter of and the maturity of special higher cost retail cds 
most of the cds were part of a special product offering in and had an average cost of

in  net interest income was adversely affected by the sustained low interest rate environment  coupled with a decline in average loan balances experienced as a result of significant payoffs and charge offs during the year 
peoples deposit pricing strategy over the past two years has caused a moderate decrease in money market balances and high cost retail certificates of deposit cds

these determinations were made in connection with management quarterly analysis of the investment portfolio described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion  which included evaluating the credit quality of underlying issuers and estimating cash flows to be received from the securities 
the losses associated with collateralized debt obligations cdo securities were the result of reduced cash flow within these structured investments since in the first quarter of  management analysis concluded two equity tranche cdo securities held in peoples investment portfolio were total losses based on management analysis of estimated cash flows to be received

in  peoples experienced revenue growth from several non interest income sources 
this success reflects peoples continued emphasis on maintaining a diversified revenue stream through greater reliance on fee based revenues

the following table details peoples deposit account service charges for the years ended december dollars in thousands overdraft and non sufficient funds fees account maintenance fees other fees and charges total deposit account service charges the amount of deposit account service charges  particularly fees for overdrafts and non sufficient funds  is largely dependent on the timing and volume of customer activity 
peoples typically experiences a lower volume of overdraft and non sufficient funds fees annually in the first quarter attributable to customers receiving income tax refunds  while volumes generally increase in the fourth quarter in connection with the holiday shopping season 
the lower overdraft and non sufficient funds fees were largely due to customer behavior

peoples also added approximately million in brokerage assets during due to acquisitions completed during the quarters 
the us financial markets experienced a general increase during  which also contributed to the increase in managed assets 
peoples e banking services include atm and debit cards  direct deposit services and internet banking  and serve as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients

in  peoples customers used their debit cards to complete million of transactions  versus million in and million in mortgage banking income is comprised mostly of net gains from the origination and sale of long term  fixed rate real estate loans in the secondary market 
as a result  the amount of income recognized by peoples is largely dependent on customer demand and long term interest rates for residential real estate loans offered in the secondary market 
mortgage banking income was up significantly   or  compared to the prior year 
the increase was the result of higher production volumes driven mostly by refinancing activity due to historically low mortgage interest rates

sales based and incentive compensation was higher in both and due primarily to expense accruals associated with corporate incentive plans  which are tied largely to peoples financial performance 
in  peoples also incurred higher sales based compensation corresponding with increased sales production within its mortgage banking  insurance and wealth management activities 
in  employee benefit costs benefited from lower employee medical benefit plan expenses  which are tied to claims activity 
however  in  employee medical benefit plan expenses were higher than those experienced in in and  peoples incurred pension settlement charges totaling  and  respectively 
for  the settlement charges more than offset the impact of peoples freezing the accrual of pension benefits effective march  the pension benefit freeze significantly lowered the threshold for recognizing pension settlement charges 
under us gaap  peoples is required to recognize a settlement gain or loss when the aggregate amount of lump sum distributions to participants equals or exceeds the sum of the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension cost 
the amount of settlement gain or loss recognized is the pro rata amount of the unrealized gain or loss existing immediately prior to the settlement 
management anticipates peoples incurring pension settlement charges in as the threshold will be lower corresponding with the decrease in discount rate used in the measurement of peoples pension liability 
stock based compensation is generally recognized over the vesting period  typically ranging from months to years  although for time based awards  peoples must immediately recognize the entire expense for awards to employees who are eligible for retirement at the grant date 
for all awards  expense is only recognized for the portion of awards that is expected to vest 
the majority of peoples stock based compensation expense is attributable to annual equity based incentive awards to employees  which are awarded in the first quarter and based upon peoples achieving certain performance goals during the prior year 
in the first quarter of  peoples granted restricted shares to officers and key employees with both time based and performance based vesting periods and recognized stock based compensation expense for the entire cost of awards that were granted to employees eligible for retirement on the grant date 
stock based compensation expense in included  of additional expense relating to equity based incentive awards granted to key employees in prior years 
much of the additional expense was the result of actual forfeitures being lower than previously estimated  while a lesser portion related to awards granted in the first quarter of with performance based vesting conditions 
in prior quarters  peoples did not record any expense related to these performance based awards since management had determined it was not probable these awards would vest 
however  the continued strong earnings performance in led management to conclude it was probable these awards would vest 
under us gaap  peoples was required to recognize the entire pro rata expense relating to these awards since the grant date 
on september   the board of directors announced a grant of unrestricted common shares to all full time and some part time employees that did not already participate in the equity plan 
the grant date was october  and resulted in  of expense

as part of the revitalization of our branch network  depreciation expense will continue to increase throughout depreciation expense was held relatively flat during due in large part to management limiting capital expenditures during in connection with various cost saving initiatives 
management continues to monitor capital expenditures and explore opportunities to enhance peoples operating efficiency 
professional fees expense represents the cost of accounting  legal and other third party professional services utilized by peoples 
during  peoples incurred  in professional fees as a result of acquisition related activities 
in  professional fees increased as a result of the costs related to peoples new power checking product  which was introduced at the start of the year 
another significant driver of the higher professional fees in was increased consulting services related to various management projects and initiatives to improve overall operating efficiency 
peoples e banking expense  which is comprised of bankcard and internet based banking costs  increased in both and as a result of customers completing a larger percentage of their transactions using their debit cards and peoples internet banking service 
these factors have also produced a greater increase in the corresponding e banking revenues over the same periods 
overall  management believes e banking expense levels are reasonable considering peoples e banking services have generated higher net revenues and have helped to improve overall relationship profitability  due to the lower transaction costs incurred by peoples 
marketing expense  which includes advertising  donation and other public relations costs  increased compared to the prior years due mostly to the rebranding efforts 
contributions totaling  to peoples bancorp foundation inc were made in  compared to  in peoples formed this private foundation in to make charitable contributions to organizations within peoples primary market area 
in prior years  peoples limited such contributions as part of its efforts to control operating costs 
future contributions to peoples bancorp foundation inc will be evaluated on a quarterly basis  with the determination of the amount of any contribution based largely on the perceived level of need within the communities peoples serves 
marketing expense in was impacted by peoples increasing its advertising activity compared to prior years 
peoples is subject to state franchise taxes  which are based largely on peoples bank equity at year end  in the states where it has a physical presence 
overall  state franchise taxes have remained consistent over the last three years  due to relatively stable equity levels at peoples bank

foreclosed real estate and other loan expenses represent costs associated with maintaining foreclosed assets  including real estate taxes and utilities  as well as various administrative costs incurred in connection with servicing and collecting outstanding loans

table of contents peoples efficiency ratio  calculated as non interest expense less amortization of other intangible assets divided by fte net interest income plus non interest income  was for  compared to for and for the increase in was due mostly to the rebranding and acquisition related costs 
the increase in was due largely to the decrease in net interest income 
income tax expense a key driver of the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized by peoples each year is the amount of pre tax income derived from tax exempt sources 
additionally  peoples receives tax benefits from its investments in tax credit funds  which reduce peoples effective tax rate 
a reconciliation of peoples recorded income tax expense benefit and effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pre provision net revenue pre provision net revenue ppnr has become a key financial measure used by federal bank regulatory agencies when assessing the capital adequacy of financial institutions 
ppnr is defined as net interest income plus non interest income minus non interest expense and therefore excludes the provision for loan losses and all gains and losses included in earnings 
as a result  ppnr represents the earnings capacity that can be either retained in order to build capital or used to absorb unexpected losses and preserve existing capital

the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to customer activity and peoples liquidity needs 
beginning in  peoples has maintained excess cash reserves at the federal reserve bank of cleveland  which are included in interest bearing deposits in other banks on the consolidated balance sheets  rather than federal funds sold due to more favorable interest rates 
at december   excess cash reserves at the federal reserve bank were million  compared to million at december  the amount of excess cash reserves maintained is dependent upon peoples daily liquidity position  which is driven primarily by changes in deposit and loan balances

for each security  management has made the determination peoples would hold these securities until maturity and concluded peoples had the ability to do so 
the decrease in obligations of us government sponsored agencies during was the result of a sale of an individual security that was recorded at million at december  since  peoples has also steadily invested in commercial mortgage backed securities either backed by the us government or by us government agencies as an additional method of diversifying from residential mortgage backed securities and pre payment risk characteristics associated with that asset class 
during that same period  peoples has sold certain state and local subdivision municipal securities as a result of the potential for increased credit risk in that sector

management evaluates these purchases 
table of contents from a credit  duration  and liquidity risk perspective 
management continues to monitor the municipal sector for signs of increased stress and will continue to be proactive in taking actions to mitigate such risk when necessary 
peoples investment in residential and commercial mortgage backed securities largely consists of securities either guaranteed by the us government or issued by us government sponsored agencies  such as fannie mae and freddie mac

table of contents the increase in real estate loan balances due to the sistersville acquisition was offset slightly due to refinancing activity 
peoples real estate loan balances have declined steadily over the last several years due to customer demand for long term  fixed rate mortgages  which peoples generally sells to the secondary market 
peoples experienced significant refinancing activity in due to historically low long term fixed rates available in the secondary market 
this activity included existing residential real estate loans held in peoples loan portfolio being refinanced with the new loan being sold to the secondary market 
peoples predominately has retained servicing rights on sold loans 
peoples does not intend to sell any of the residential real estate loans acquired as part of the sistersville acquisition 
consumer loan balances  which consist mostly of loans to finance automobile purchases  have increased in due largely to peoples placing greater emphasis on its consumer lending activity 
in prior years  peoples experienced steady growth in consumer loan balances  due mainly to the efforts in indirect lending

table of contents allowance for loan losses the amount of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each period represents management estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon its formal quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
while this process involves allocations being made to specific loans and pools of loans  the entire allowance is available for all losses incurred within the loan portfolio 
the following details management allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december dollars in thousands commercial real estate commercial and industrial total commercial residential real estate home equity lines of credit consumer deposit account overdrafts total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans the addition of million of loans added in the sistersville acquisition caused a basis point reduction in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans ratio at december  due to more favorable loss rates on the acquired loans compared to the loss rates on the remaining loans in peoples portfolio 
given the rate of loss being experienced on commercial real estate loans  in the fourth quarter of  management refined its methodology for estimating inherent losses on peoples commercial loans by performing separate evaluations of  and allocations for  commercial real estate loans and other commercial loans 
this refinement  which did not have a significant impact on the overall allowance for loan losses  included a separate analysis of lodging and lodging related loans peoples largest industrial concentration 
the significant allocations to commercial loans reflect the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and the size of this loan category in relationship to the entire loan portfolio 
in  the allowance for loan losses continued to be reduced as a result of sustained improvement in several credit quality metrics 
specifically  peoples has experienced a steady decrease in criticized loans  which are those classified as watch  substandard or doubtful  due to principal paydowns and improvements in borrowers financial conditions 
total criticized loans decreased million or since year end  reflecting million in principal paydowns 
peoples upgraded million in loans during based upon the financial condition of the borrowers 
net charge offs were below peoples long term historical rate for both of these factors had a direct impact on the estimated loss rates used to determine the appropriate allocations for commercial loans 
however  peoples remained cautious with the reduction in the allowance for loan losses as the loss rates experienced in may not be reflective of inherent losses in the portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the residential real estate and consumer loan categories is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans 
the fluctuations in these allocations have been directionally consistent with the changes in loan quality  loss experience and loan balances in these categories

during  nonaccrual commercial real estate loans with aggregate balances of million at year end were paid off  million of which was classified as troubled debt restructurings at year end the majority of peoples nonaccrual commercial real estate loans continues to consist of non owner occupied commercial properties and real estate development projects 
in general  management believes repayment of these loans is dependent on the sale of the underlying collateral 
as such  the carrying values of these loans are ultimately supported by management estimate of the net proceeds peoples would receive upon the sale of the collateral 
these estimates are based in part on market values provided by independent  licensed or certified appraisers periodically  usually no less frequently than annually 
management continues to monitor changes in real estate values from quarter to quarter and updates its estimates as needed based on observable changes in market prices and or updated appraisals for similar properties 
interest income on loans classified as nonaccrual and renegotiated at each year end that would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans was million for  million for and million for no portion of the amounts was recorded during  or  consistent with the income recognition policy described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
overall  management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december   based on all significant information currently available 
still  there can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover future losses or that the amount of nonperforming loans will remain at current levels  especially considering the current economic uncertainty that exists and the concentration of commercial loans in peoples loan portfolio

also during  peoples maintained its recent deposit strategy of growing low cost core deposits  such as checking and savings accounts  and reducing its reliance on higher cost  non core deposits  such as cds and brokered deposits 
this strategy has included more selective pricing of long term cds  governmental public fund deposits and similar non core deposits  as well as not renewing maturing brokered deposits 
these actions accounted for much of the changes in deposit balances in non interest bearing deposits continued to grow in  due largely to higher commercial deposit balances 
the increased balances reflect peoples increased focus on obtaining the deposit relationships of its commercial clients 
since year end  non interest bearing commercial deposit balances have increased million 
peoples governmental deposit accounts represent savings and interest bearing transaction accounts from state and local governmental entities 
these funds are subject to periodic fluctuations based on the timing of tax collections and subsequent expenditures or disbursements 
peoples normally experiences an increase in balances annually during the first quarter corresponding with tax collections  with declines normally in the second half of each year corresponding with expenditures by the governmental entities 
while these balances have increased since  peoples continues to emphasize growth of low cost deposits that do not require peoples to pledge assets as collateral  which is required in the case of governmental deposit accounts

capital stockholders equity during  peoples total stockholders equity benefited from earnings exceeding dividends declared 
regulatory capital ratios  with the exception of tier common  experienced modest reductions due to the sistersville acquisition and the trust preferred redemption 
at december   capital levels for both peoples and peoples bank remained substantially higher than the minimum amounts needed to be considered well capitalized institutions under banking regulations 
these higher capital levels reflect peoples desire to maintain strong capital positions to provide greater flexibility to work through the remaining asset quality issues plus provide capacity to grow the company 
the following table details peoples actual risk based capital levels and corresponding ratios at december dollars in thousands capital amounts tier common tier total tier and tier net risk weighted assets capital ratios tier common tier total tier and tier leverage ratio 
table of contents in addition to traditional capital measurements  management uses tangible capital measures to evaluate the adequacy of peoples stockholders equity 
such ratios represent non gaap financial information since their calculation removes the impact of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions on the consolidated balance sheets 
management believes this information is useful to investors since it facilitates the comparison of peoples operating performance  financial condition and trends to peers  especially those without a similar level of intangible assets to that of peoples 
further  intangible assets generally are difficult to convert into cash  especially during a financial crisis  and could decrease substantially in value should there be deterioration in the overall franchise value 
as a result  tangible common equity represents a conservative measure of the capacity for a company to incur losses but remain solvent

table of contents future outlook in  the banking industry continued to face a challenging environment interest rates remained at historically low levels  national economic conditions were relatively unfavorable and regulatory burdens increased as a result of the ongoing implementation of the dodd frank act 
despite these challenges  peoples achieved success in several major areas during these included stronger earnings due to a return to positive operating leverage  modest loan growth  continued restoration of asset quality and increased shareholder value 
also in  peoples made several strategic investments for future growth of the company 
these investments included expanding peoples consumer lending activities  completing acquisitions in all three lines of business  and rolling out a new brand and refreshed image 
management expects some conditions within the banking industry to remain difficult in the federal reserve appears committed to holding interest rates at their current low levels  while unemployment remains elevated and inflation low 
additionally  the pace at which new regulatory requirements will be implemented is not likely to slow down 
in terms of the economy  national economic conditions could remain unfavorable 
however  oil and natural gas exploration within the marcellus and utica shale formations is causing increased economic activity within peoples primary market area 
specifically  many rural customers are gaining considerable wealth from the sales leasing of mineral rights on their land 
hotels  restaurants and other local businesses also are benefiting from the influx of workers 
these conditions are causing the unemployment rates in ohio and west virginia to remain lower than the national average 
a major accomplishment for was peoples ability to generate positive operating leverage growing total revenue faster than total non interest expenses and ending a three year negative trend 
management is committed to generating positive operating leverage each year 
in  management is expecting total revenue growth of to  driven largely by stronger non interest income generation 
at the same time  total non interest expenses will be higher in due to the ongoing strategic investments 
as a result  peoples efficiency ratio is expected to be in the range of to during  absent any new acquisition related costs 
management remains committed to disciplined expense management and controlling non interest expenses 
in  peoples non interest income will benefit from a full year impact of recent acquisitions 
management also anticipates better revenue synergies due to peoples rebranding initiative and the economic activity being generated from the shale drilling within peoples footprint 
in contrast  first quarter non interest income is expected to be impacted by lower annual performance based insurance income 
while difficult to predict  management believes this income could be up to lower than the amount earned in the reduction could occur due to higher insurance loss experienced in as a result of claims activity related to a major storm that hit the region in late june mortgage banking income also could be lower in should there be a slowdown in refinancing activity 
overall  management anticipates non interest income growth in similar to  if not better than  the rate of increase experienced in peoples revenue stream is more diversified than most community banks comparable in size to peoples 
still  net interest income remains a major source of revenue for peoples 
as a result  peoples ability to grow revenue in will be impacted by the amount of net interest income generated 
the current outlook is for the federal reserve to allow interest rates to remain at their historically low levels throughout all of should this occur  management would expect both net interest income and margin to face downward pressure from lower reinvestment rates within the loan and investment portfolios 
some of this impact could be offset by the impact of the trust preferred redemption 
this transaction is expected to lower peoples overall cost of funds by approximately basis points in management does not anticipate taking any additional actions in to restructure the liability side of peoples balance sheet 
rather  peoples expects to maintain its recent funding strategy of adjusting its deposit mix away from higher cost cds to low cost checking and savings balances 
management would expect both net interest income and margin to benefit from any meaningful increase in market interest rates based upon the current interest rate risk profile 
however  it remains inherently difficult to predict and manage the future trend of peoples net interest income and margin due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of future interest rate changes  as well as the impact of competition for loans and deposits 
given the current interest rate outlook  peoples is committed to achieving meaningful loan growth as a means of growing net interest income and expanding net interest margin in management believes gross loan balances could increase by to in  with more than half coming from growth in consumer loans 
within peoples commercial lending activity  the primary emphasis continues to be on non mortgage commercial lending opportunities  including small business lending  and developing new niches  such as health care and oil and gas lending 
as a result  commercial and industrial loan balances are expected to increase to in  while commercial real estate loan balances could increase by to 
peoples also remains committed to making consumer loans a larger portion of the loan portfolio 
in early  peoples bolstered its consumer lending activities by adding an experienced consumer lender to the management team 
since that time  management has been working diligently to improve peoples processes and develop the structure to support further 
table of contents expansion of consumer lending 
already in  peoples has added a sales position within its indirect consumer lending area to generate greater activity from automobile dealerships operating in peoples market area 
in  peoples earnings benefited from the release of reserves due to the sustained improvement in asset quality and significantly higher recoveries than prior years 
as peoples works to grow loans in  management will maintain its focus on improving peoples asset quality by balancing loan growth with prudent risk management and sound underwriting standards 
overall  peoples goal is to return all of its credit metrics to their long term historical levels  which management believes could occur during while management will continue to pursue collection of prior charge offs  it is unlikely peoples will sustain the level of recoveries experienced during in and future years 
as a result  management anticipates peoples net charge off rate for to be more in line with its long term historical range of to of average loans 
in light of these factors and the planned loan growth  management intends to remain prudent with the level of peoples allowance for loan losses 
consequently  the amount of any recovery of  or provision for  loan losses will be based upon management quarterly assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
peoples total non interest expense is expected to increase slightly in much of the additional costs will be due to a full year impact of the acquisitions completed in peoples also will incur some costs associated with the million branch refresh project announced during the fourth quarter 
this project will involve floor to ceiling renovations intended to bring a consistent look to all of peoples offices and improve the use of existing office space 
additionally  the project will create a more engaging and attractive environment for clients and employees 
at the end of this project  every aspect of the company will have undergone a transformation to peoples new brand 
even with these additional expenses  management expects peoples total non interest expenses to be approximately million per quarter during  without any new acquisition related costs 
peoples investment securities portfolio could remain a significant portion of the earning asset base in to the extent planned loan growth occurs  management may reduce the size of the investment portfolio 
most of the reduction would occur as a result of normal monthly cash flows generated by the portfolio  given the significant investment in mortgage backed securities  which would be used to fund new loan production 
management also could adjust the size or composition of the portfolio in response to other factors  such as changes in liquidity needs and interest rate conditions 
peoples also continues to explore market expansion opportunities in or near its current market areas 
management primary focus will be on increasing market share within existing markets  while taking advantage of potential growth opportunities within its insurance and wealth management lines of business 
management believes peoples capital position remains strong enough to support an active mergers and acquisitions strategy and expansion of peoples core financial service businesses of banking  insurance and wealth management 
consequently  management will continue to explore the acquisition of companies engaged in these activities  emphasizing opportunities to complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent  with a lesser emphasis being placed on geographic location or size 
additionally  peoples remains committed to preserving its diversified revenue stream where nearly of total revenue is derived from peoples fee based businesses 
further  such transactions must be accretive in their second year in order to satisfy peoples goal of improving shareholder return 
the operating environment for banks in is expected to remain challenging 
peoples strategic objectives include a return to being a steady  dependable performer for its shareholders and taking advantage of market expansion opportunities 
as such  management is committed to generating results in the top quartile of industry performance and providing returns for peoples shareholders superior to those of its peers  regardless of operating conditions 
these goals will require peoples to maintain a continual focus on four key areas revenue growth  expense management  asset quality and capital strength 
management is committed to overcoming any challenges peoples will face in and building upon the earnings momentum of success will be achieved through disciplined execution of strategies and partnership with peoples clients and communities 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity while peoples is exposed to various business risks  the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are major risks that can materially impact future results of operations and financial condition due to their complexity and dynamic nature 
the objective of peoples asset liability management alm function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity and safety 
this objective requires peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through its management of the mix of assets and liabilities  their related cash flows and the rates earned and paid on those assets and liabilities 
ultimately  the alm function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets and selection of appropriate funding sources 

table of contents interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is one of the most significant risks arising in the normal course of business of financial services companies like peoples 
irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples exposure to irr is due primarily to differences in the maturity or repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  other factors  such as prepayments of loans and investment securities or early withdrawal of deposits  can affect peoples exposure to irr and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams 
peoples has assigned overall management of irr to the alco  which has established an irr management policy that sets minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of peoples irr policy is to assist the alco in its evaluation of the impact of changing interest rate conditions on earnings and economic value of equity  as well as assist with the implementation of strategies intended to reduce peoples irr 
the management of irr involves either maintaining or changing the level of risk exposure by changing the repricing and maturity characteristics of the cash flows for specific assets or liabilities 
additional oversight of peoples irr is provided by the asset liability management and investment committee of peoples bank board of directors 
this committee also reviews and approves peoples irr management policy at least annually 
the alco uses various methods to assess and monitor the current level of peoples irr and the impact of potential strategies or other changes 
however  the alco predominantly relies on simulation modeling in its overall management of irr since it is a dynamic measure 
simulation modeling also estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures on future earnings and projected fair value of equity 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet and current interest rates held constant for the next twelve months 
alternate scenarios are prepared which simulate the impact of increasing and decreasing market interest rates  assuming parallel yield curve shifts 
comparisons produced from the simulation data  showing the changes in net interest income from the base interest rate scenario  illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure 
additional simulations  when deemed appropriate or necessary  are prepared using different interest rate scenarios from those used with the base case simulation and or possible changes in balance sheet composition 
the additional simulations include non parallel shifts in interest rates whereby the direction and or magnitude of change of short term interest rates is different than the changes applied to longer term interest rates 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case are provided to the alco for review and discussion 
the alco has established limits on changes in the twelve month net interest income forecast and the economic value of equity from the base case 
the alco may establish risk tolerances for other parallel and non parallel rate movements  as deemed necessary 
the following table details the current policy limits used to manage the level of peoples irr immediate and sustained shift in interest rates net interest income economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points the following table shows the estimated changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity based upon a standard  parallel shock analysis dollars in thousands increase in interest rate estimated increase in net interest income estimated decrease increase in economic value of equity in basis points december  december  december  december  this table uses a standard  parallel shock analysis for assessing the irr to net interest income and the economic value of equity 
a parallel shock means all points on the yield curve one year  two year  three year  etc 
are 
table of contents directionally shocked the same amount of basis points basis points is equal to 
while management regularly assesses the impact of both increasing and decreasing interest rates  the table above only reflects the impact of upward shocks due to the fact a downward parallel shock of basis points or more is not possible given that some short term rates are currently less than 
although a parallel shock table can give insight into the current direction and magnitude of irr inherent in the balance sheet  interest rates do not always move in a complete parallel manner during interest rate cycles 
these nonparallel movements in interest rates  commonly called yield curve steepening or flattening movements  tend to occur during the beginning and end of an interest rate cycle  with differences in the timing  direction and magnitude of changes in short term and long term interest rates 
thus  any benefit that could occur as a result of the federal reserve increasing short term interest rates in future quarters could be offset by an inverse movement in long term interest rates 
as a result  management conducts more advanced interest rate shock scenarios to gain a better understanding of peoples exposure to nonparallel rate shifts 
at december   peoples consolidated balance sheet remained positioned for a rising interest rate environment  as illustrated by the potential increase in net interest income shown in the above table 
during  peoples became more sensitive to rising interest rates due to several factors 
the largest factors impacting peoples interest rate sensitivity were the contractual conversion of certain commercial loans from fixed rate to variable rate loans  and increased sensitivity to rising interest rates in the investment portfolio 
additionally  actions taken on the liability side of the balance sheet  which included retail deposit pricing strategies  the extinguishment of longer wholesale borrowings and peoples trust preferred redemption  also impacted peoples interest rate sensitivity position 
while parallel interest rate shock scenarios are useful in assessing the level of irr inherent in peoples consolidated balance sheet  interest rates typically move in a non parallel manner 
thus  any benefit that could occur as a result of the federal reserve board increasing short term interest rates in future quarters could be offset by an inverse movement in long term interest rates 
liquidity in addition to irr management  another major objective of the alco is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided by cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  calls  principal and interest payments from loans and investment securities 
peoples also uses various wholesale funding sources to supplement funding from customer deposits 
these external sources provide peoples with the ability to obtain large quantities of funds in a relatively short time period in the event of sudden unanticipated cash needs 
however  an over utilization of external funding sources can expose peoples to greater liquidity risk as these external sources may not be accessible during times of market stress 
additionally  peoples may be exposed to the risk associated with providing excess collateral to external funding providers  commonly referred to as counterparty risk 
as a result  the alco liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position and the concentration of non core funding sources  both wholesale funding and brokered deposits 
in addition to external sources of funding  peoples considers certain types of deposits to be less stable or volatile funding 
these deposits include special money market products  large cds and public funds 
peoples has established volatility factors for these various deposit products  and the liquidity management policy establishes a limit on the total level of volatile funding 
additionally  peoples measures the maturities of external sources of funding for periods of month  months  months and months and has established policy limits for the amounts maturing in each of these periods 
the purpose of these limits is to minimize exposure to what is commonly termed as rollover risk 
an additional strategy used by peoples in the management of liquidity risk is maintaining a targeted level of liquid assets 
these are assets that can be converted into cash in a relatively short period of time 
management defines liquid assets as unencumbered cash  including cash on deposit at the federal reserve bank and the market value of us government and agency securities that are not pledged 
excluded from this definition are pledged securities  non government and agency securities  municipal securities and loans 
management has established a minimum level of liquid assets in the liquidity management policy  which is expressed as a percentage of loans and unfunded loan commitments 
peoples also has established a policy limit around the level of liquefiable assets  also expressed as a percentage of loans and unfunded loan commitments 
liquefiable assets are defined as liquid assets plus the market value of unpledged securities not included in the liquid asset measurement 
an essential element in the management of liquidity risk is a forecast of the sources and uses of anticipated cash flows 
on a monthly basis  peoples forecasts sources and uses of cash for the next twelve months 
to assist in the 
table of contents management of liquidity  management has established a liquidity coverage ratio  which is defined as the total sources of cash divided by the total uses of cash 
a ratio of greater than times indicates that forecasted sources of cash are adequate to fund forecasted uses of cash 
the liquidity management policy establishes a minimum limit of times 
as of december   peoples had a ratio of times  which was within policy limits 
peoples also forecasts secondary or contingent sources of cash  and this includes external sources of funding and liquid assets 
these sources of cash would be required if and when the forecasted liquidity coverage ratio dropped below the policy limit of times 
an additional liquidity measurement used by management includes the total forecasted sources of cash and the contingent sources of cash divided by the forecasted uses of cash 
management has established a minimum ratio of times for this liquidity management policy limit 
as of december   peoples had a ratio of times  which was within policy limits 
disruptions in the sources and uses of cash can occur which can drastically alter the actual cash flows and negatively impact peoples ability to access internal and external sources of cash 
such disruptions might occur due to increased withdrawals of deposits  increased funding required for funding loan commitments  a decrease in the ability to access external funding sources and other forces that would increase the need for funding and limit peoples ability to access needed funds 
as a result  peoples maintains a liquidity contingency funding plan lcfp that considers various degrees of disruptions and develops action plans around these scenarios 
peoples lcfp identifies scenarios where funding disruptions might occur and creates scenarios of varying degrees of severity 
the disruptions considered include an increase in funding of unfunded loan commitments  unanticipated withdrawals of deposits  decreases in the renewal of maturing certificates of deposit and reductions in cash earnings 
additionally  the lcfp creates stress scenarios where access to external funding sources  or contingency funding  is suddenly limited which includes a significant increase in the margin requirements where securities or loans are pledged  limited access to funding from other banks and limited access to funding from the fhlb and the federal reserve bank 
peoples lcfp scenarios include a base scenario  a mild stress scenario  a moderate stress scenario and a severe stress scenario 
each of these is defined as to the severity and action plans are developed around each 
liquidity management also requires the monitoring of risk indicators that may alert the alco to a developing liquidity situation or crisis 
early detection of stress scenarios allows peoples to take actions to help mitigate the impact to the bank business operations 
the lcfp contains various indicators  termed key risk indicators or kri that are monitored on monthly basis  at a minimum 
the kri include both internal and external indicators and include loan delinquency levels  classified and watch list loan levels  non performing loans to loans and to total assets  the loan to deposit ratio  the level of net non core funding dependence  the level of contingency funding sources  the liquidity coverage ratio  changes in regulatory capital levels  forecasted operating loss and negative media concerning peoples  irrational competitor pricing that persists and an increase in rates for external funding sources 
the lcfp establishes levels that define each of these kri under base  mild  moderate and severe scenarios 
the lcfp is reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis by the alco and the asset liability management and investment committee of peoples bank board of directors 
additionally  testing of the lcfp is required on an annual basis 
various stress scenarios and the related actions are simulated according to the lcfp 
the results are reviewed and discussed and changes or revisions are made to the lcfp accordingly 
additionally  every two years  the lcfp is subjected to a third party review for effectiveness and regulatory compliance 
overall  management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from the investment portfolio  along with the availability of other funding sources  will allow peoples to meet anticipated cash obligations  as well as special needs and off balance sheet commitments 
off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations peoples routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of peoples normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate contracts and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit investments 

table of contents the following is a summary of peoples significant off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations 
detailed information regarding these activities and obligations can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as follows activity or obligation note off balance sheet credit related financial instruments operating lease obligations long term debt obligations contingent consideration related to acquisitions traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers and could require peoples to make cash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of peoples exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or only partially be used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
peoples continues to lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancellable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods generally ranging from two to ten years 
several of peoples leased facilities are inside retail shopping centers or office buildings and  as a result  are not available for purchase 
management believes these leased facilities increase peoples visibility within its markets and afford sales associates additional access to current and potential clients 
the following table details the aggregate amount of future payments peoples is required to make under certain contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases time deposits contingent consideration related to acquisitions total amounts reflect solely the minimum required principal payments 
amounts assume required revenue metrics are achieved 
management does not anticipate peoples current off balance sheet activities will have a material impact on its future results of operations and financial condition based on historical experience and recent trends 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets
