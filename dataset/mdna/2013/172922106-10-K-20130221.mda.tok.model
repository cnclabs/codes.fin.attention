critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses that represents management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and recorded as a reduction of the investment in loans 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses  and additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is provided in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
for most of the corporation s debt securities  the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti 
in making that evaluation  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
management s assessments of the likelihood and potential for recovery in value of securities are subjective and based on sensitive assumptions 
net interest income the corporation s primary source of operating income is net interest income  which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest income in   and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis

at december   the net deferred tax asset was  down from the balance at december  of  the main reasons for the decrease in net deferred tax asset included reduction in deferred tax asset related to realized losses on securities to  at december  from  at december   reduction in deferred tax asset related to the credit for alternative minimum tax amt paid in prior periods  which decreased to  at december  from  at december   reduction in deferred tax asset related to general business credit carryforwards  which fell to at december  from  at december   and increase in deferred tax liability associated with unrealized gains on available for sale securities to  at december  from  at december  the reduction in deferred tax asset from realized losses on securities resulted from the sale of a pooled trust preferred security for which otti had been recorded for financial reporting purposes in previous years 
the reduction in deferred tax assets for general business credit carryforwards and the credit for amt resulted from the estimated excess of the corporation s regular tax liability over the amt liability in  as results indicate the credits would be fully utilized and a portion of the credit for prior years amt paid would be realized 
the corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  is fully realizable  however  if management determines the corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset  the corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset  which would negatively impact earnings 
additional information related to income taxes is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
securities table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects an increase of  to  at december  from december  this change was followed by a decrease of  to  at december  in both and  the corporation increased its holdings of municipal bonds and agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
the increases were partially offset by decreases in the balances of us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  and trust preferred securities as management reinvested cash flows from these securities in other types of investments

the total of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects a total decrease of  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
since the end of  the corporation experienced a net decrease in total loans outstanding under the residential mortgage segment  with more residential mortgage originations than in previous years sold into the secondary market 
in september  the corporation initiated participation in the mpf xtra program administered by the federal home loan banks of pittsburgh and chicago for the sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market

the interest rate simulation model classifies certain loans under different categories than they appear in table vii 
fixed rate loans are shown in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  and variable rate loans are shown based on the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that fixed rate loans are approximately of the loan portfolio 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended periods until re pricing is one of the concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices

notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses of  at december  was down from  at december  as presented in table x  the specific component of the allowance on impaired loans decreased to  at december  from  at december  the decrease in the allowance on impaired loans at december  as compared to december  included a reduction of  related to one commercial relationship 
in  charge offs totaling  all in the fourth quarter were recorded related to this commercial relationship for which specific allowances totaling  had been established at december  after the impact of these charge offs and re evaluation of the allowances required  the corporation had loans outstanding totaling  with a specific allowance of  at december  related to this commercial borrower 
table x also shows that the collectively determined components of the allowance fell by a total of  as of december  compared to december   mainly because of the decrease in the balance of outstanding loans 
in addition to the effect of the decrease in outstanding loans  the collectively determined allowance for the commercial segment was impacted by a lower net charge off percentage used to determine a portion of the collectively determined allowance in as compared to the corporation used net charge offs as a percentage of average outstanding loans for the previous three calendar years to estimate a portion of the collectively determined allowance at both december  and december  the net charge off percentages did not change significantly for the residential mortgage and consumer segments  and the qualitative factors used in determining the collectively evaluated components of the allowance did not change significantly for any of the segments  at december  as compared to december  table ix shows a provision for loan losses of  in  in comparison to a credit for loan losses of  in as shown in table xii  the average provision for loan losses for the five year period ended december  was  the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each period is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
in  the corporation s provision for loan losses included a net provision of  related to the commercial relationship referred to above for which charge offs totaling  were recorded 
also in  the provision was reduced as a result of the reduction in the collectively determined components of the allowance  mainly due to the reduction in outstanding loans  as described above 
in  the credit for loan losses reflected a reduction in the collectively determined portion of the allowance  mainly due to a reduction in outstanding loans 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the provision credit for loan losses and activity in the allowance for loan losses  by segment and class  for and table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans  and loans that have been modified under terms that are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
at december   total impaired loans were  down from  at december  nonaccrual loans totaled  at december   up from  at december   and total loans past due days or more and still in accrual status increased to  at december  from  at december  interest continues to be accrued on loans days or more past due that management deems to be well secured and in the process of collection  and for which no loss is anticipated 
over the period  each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
as a result  a limited number of relationships may significantly impact the total amount of allowance required on impaired loans  and may significantly impact the amount of total charge offs reported in any one period 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  amounted to  at december  and  at december  changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
if available for sale securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings  and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning management s evaluation of available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment at december  stockholders equity is also affected by the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to underfunded defined benefit plans  net of deferred income tax  was  at december  and  at december  comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the intent of this standard is to increase the prominence of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
accordingly  the corporation has included statements of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements for  and comprehensive income is the total of net income  and all other changes in equity from non stockholder sources  which are referred to as other comprehensive income 
changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss are included in other comprehensive income  and for the corporation  consist of changes in unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities and changes in underfunded defined benefit plans 
comprehensive income totaled  in as compared to  in and  in in  comprehensive income included net income of  in  which was  lower than in and  higher than in  other comprehensive income from unrealized gains on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  of  in as compared to  in and an other comprehensive loss from net unrealized losses of  in  and other comprehensive income from defined benefit plans of  in as compared to an other comprehensive loss of  in and other comprehensive income of  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
beginning in september  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve lowered the fed funds target rate numerous times  in december  it established a target range of to  which it has maintained through also  the federal reserve has injected massive amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system through a variety of programs 
the federal reserve has purchased large amounts of securities in an effort to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic growth 
further  the federal reserve announced that it expects to continue exceptionally accommodative monetary policies with a general target of maintaining accommodative policy until the us unemployment rate hits a sustainable level of or less 
despite the current low short term rate environment  liquidity injections  and commodity price increases  inflation statistics indicate that the overall rate of inflation is unlikely to significantly affect the corporation s operations within the near future 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and their recent or potential future effects on the corporation s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the corporation s financial instruments 
in addition to the effects of interest rates  the market prices of the corporation s debt securities within the available for sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums amounts of spread over risk free rates demanded by investors 
management cannot control changes in market prices of securities based on fluctuations in the risk premiums demanded by investors  nor can management control the volume of deferrals or defaults by the issuers of debt securities owned by the corporation 
however  management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position discussed in the stockholders equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis and ample sources of liquidity discussed in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition  and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy limits acceptable fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario and variances in the market value of portfolio equity from the baseline values based on current rates 
table xiv  which follows this discussion  is based on the results of calculations performed using the simulation model as of october  and the table shows that as of october  and  the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios

investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect the banking industry in general  including credit risk  competition from non bank entities  interest rate risk and other factors  which could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
as discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized an impairment loss in earnings related to a bank stock of  in the corporation recognized no otti losses related to bank stocks in equity securities held as of december  and are presented in table xv
