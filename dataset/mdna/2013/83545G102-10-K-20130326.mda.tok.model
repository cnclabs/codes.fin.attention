item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our plans for the use of capital generated from operations 
our ability to complete acquisitions in the future will depend on many factors  including the availability of financing and the existence of any contractual provisions that may restrict our acquisition activity 
the automotive retailing industry remains highly fragmented  and we believe that further consolidation may occur over the long term 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities continue to exist for dealership groups with the capital and experience to identify  acquire and professionally manage dealerships 
business strategy maximize asset returns through process execution 
we have developed standardized operating processes that are documented in operating playbooks for our dealerships 
through the continued implementation of our operating playbooks  we believe organic growth opportunities exist by offering a more favorable buying experience to our customers and create efficiencies in our business processes 
we believe the development  refinement and implementation of these operating processes will enhance the customer experience  make us more competitive in the markets we serve and drive revenue growth across each of our revenue streams 
invest in dealership properties 
historically  we have operated our dealerships primarily on property financed through long term operating leases 
as these leases mature  or as we have an opportunity to purchase the underlying real estate prior to renewal  we have begun to purchase and own more of our dealership properties 
we remain opportunistic in purchasing existing properties or relocating dealership operations to owned real estate where the returns are favorable 
we believe owning our properties will  over the long term  strengthen our balance sheet and reduce our overall cost of operating and financing our dealership facilities 
improve capital structure 
as we generate cash through operations  we will opportunistically repurchase our class a common stock in open market or structured transactions 
diverse revenue streams 
we have multiple revenue streams 
in addition to new vehicle sales  our revenue sources include used vehicle sales  which we believe are less sensitive to economic cycles and seasonal influences that exist with new vehicle sales 
our fixed operations sales carry a higher gross margin than new and used vehicle sales and  in the past  have not been as economically sensitive as new vehicle sales 
we also offer customers assistance in obtaining financing and a range of automobile related insurance products 
portfolio management 
our long term growth and acquisition strategy is focused on large metropolitan markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  midwest and california 
we seek to add like branded dealerships to our portfolio that exist in regions in which we already operate 
a majority of our dealerships are either luxury or mid line import brands 
for the year ended december   approximately of our new vehicle revenue was generated by mid line import and luxury dealerships  which usually have higher operating margins  more stable fixed operations departments  lower associate turnover and lower inventory levels 

table of contents the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand percentage of new vehicle revenue year ended december  brand luxury bmw mercedes lexus cadillac audi mini land rover porsche volvo infiniti acura jaguar other luxury total luxury mid line import honda toyota volkswagen hyundai other nissan total mid line import domestic ford general motors total domestic total in accordance with the provisions of presentation of financial statements in the accounting standards codification the asc  prior period income statement data reflects reclassifications to i exclude franchises sold  identified for sale  or terminated subsequent to december  that had not been included in discontinued operations as of that date or ii include franchises previously held for sale that subsequently were reclassified to held and used

expand our ecommerce capabilities 
automotive customers have become increasingly more comfortable using technology to research their vehicle buying alternatives and communicate with dealership personnel 
the 
table of contents internet presents a marketing  advertising and automotive sales channel that we will continue to utilize nationally to drive demand creation and demand maximization for our dealerships 
our technology platforms have given us the ability to leverage technology to more efficiently integrate systems  customize our dealership websites and use our data to improve the effectiveness of our advertising and interaction with our customers 
this also allows us to market all of our products and services to a national audience and  at the same time  support the local market penetration of our individual dealerships 
achieve high levels of customer satisfaction 
we focus on maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction 
our personalized sales process is designed to satisfy customers by providing high quality vehicles and service in a positive  consumer friendly buying environment 
several manufacturers offer specific financial incentives on a per vehicle basis if certain customer satisfaction index csi levels which vary by manufacturer are achieved by a dealership 
in addition  all manufacturers consider csi scores in approving acquisitions 
in order to keep dealership and executive management focused on customer satisfaction  we include csi results as a component of our incentive based compensation programs 
train  develop and retain associates 
we believe our associates are the cornerstone of our business and crucial to our financial success 
our goal is to develop our associates and foster an environment where our associates can contribute and grow with the company 
associate satisfaction is very important to us  and we believe a high level of associate satisfaction reduces turnover and enhances our customers experience at our dealerships by pairing our customers with well trained  seasoned associates 
we believe that our comprehensive training of all employees provides us with a competitive advantage over other dealership groups 
increase sales of higher margin products and services 
we continue to pursue opportunities to increase our sales of higher margin products and services by expanding the following finance  insurance and other aftermarket products each sale of a new or used vehicle gives us an opportunity to provide our customers with financing and insurance options and earn financing fees and insurance commissions 
we also offer our customers the opportunity to purchase extended service contracts and other aftermarket products 
we currently offer a wide range of non recourse financing  leasing  other aftermarket products  service contracts and insurance products to our customers 
we emphasize menu selling techniques and other best practices to increase our sales of f i products at our dealerships 
parts  service collision repair each of our dealerships offers a fully integrated service and parts department 
manufacturers permit warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships such as ours 
as a result  our franchised dealerships are uniquely qualified and positioned to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly complex vehicles 
we believe we can continue to grow our profitable parts and service business over the long term by increasing service capacity  investing in sophisticated equipment and well trained technicians  using variable rate pricing structures  focusing on customer service and efficiently managing our parts inventory 
in addition  we believe our emphasis on selling extended service contracts associated with new and used vehicle retail sales will drive further service and parts business in our dealerships as we increase the potential to retain current customers beyond the term of the standard manufacturer warranty period 
certified pre owned vehicles various manufacturers provide franchised dealers the opportunity to sell certified pre owned cpo vehicles 
this certification process extends the standard manufacturer warranty on the cpo vehicle  which we believe increases our potential to retain the pre owned purchaser as a future parts and service customer 
since cpo warranty work can only be performed at franchised dealerships  we believe cpo warranty work will increase our fixed operations business 
value used vehicle we believe the market for value vehicles used vehicles with retail prices below  is broad and not as sensitive to market fluctuations as higher priced used vehicles 
our strategy in retailing these vehicles includes the use of technology and market data to determine optimal pricing and placement of these vehicles at our dealerships 

table of contents relationships with manufacturers each of our dealerships operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement that governs the relationship between the dealership and the manufacturer 
each franchise or dealer agreement specifies the location of the dealership for the sale of vehicles and for the performance of certain approved services in a specified market area 
the designation of such areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 
in addition  most manufacturers allocate vehicles on a turn and earn basis that rewards high unit sales volume 
a franchise or dealer agreement requires the dealer to meet specified standards regarding showrooms  facilities and equipment for servicing vehicles  inventories  minimum net working capital  personnel training and other aspects of the business 
each franchise or dealer agreement also gives the related manufacturer the right to approve the dealer operator and any material change in management or ownership of the dealership 
each manufacturer may terminate a franchise or dealer agreement under certain circumstances  such as a change in control of the dealership without manufacturer approval  the impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  the death  removal or withdrawal of the dealer operator  the conviction of the dealership or the dealership s owner or dealer operator of certain crimes  the failure to adequately operate the dealership or maintain new vehicle financing arrangements  insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership or a material breach of other provisions of the applicable franchise or dealer agreement 
many automobile manufacturers have developed policies regarding public ownership of dealerships 
policies implemented by manufacturers include the following restrictions the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises upon a change in control of our company or a material change in the composition of our board of directors  the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises if an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than of the voting power of our securities  and the ability to force the sale of their respective franchises if an individual or entity other than an automobile manufacturer or distributor acquires more than of the voting power of our securities  and the manufacturer disapproves of such individual s or entity s ownership interest 
to the extent that new or amended manufacturer policies restrict the number of dealerships which may be owned by a dealership group or the transferability of our common stock  such policies could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that we will be able to renew at expiration all of our existing franchise and dealer agreements 
many states have placed limitations upon manufacturers and distributors ability to sell new motor vehicles directly to customers in their respective states in an effort to protect dealers from practices they believe constitute unfair competition 
in general  these statutes make it unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to compete with a new motor vehicle dealer in the same brand operating under an agreement or franchise from the manufacturer or distributor in the relevant market area 
certain states  such as florida  georgia  south carolina  north carolina and virginia  limit the amount of time that a manufacturer may temporarily operate a dealership 
in addition  all of the states in which our dealerships currently do business require manufacturers to show good cause for terminating or failing to renew a dealer s franchise or dealer agreement 
further  each of the states provides some method for dealers to challenge manufacturer attempts to establish dealerships of the same brand in their relevant market area 
competition the retail automotive industry is highly competitive 
depending on the geographic market  we compete both with dealers offering the same brands and product lines as ours and dealers offering other manufacturers vehicles 
we also compete for vehicle sales with auto brokers  leasing companies and services offered on the internet that provide customer referrals to other dealerships or who broker vehicle sales between customers and other dealerships 
we compete with small  local dealerships and with large multi franchise automotive dealership groups 

table of contents we believe that the principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are the location of dealerships  the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers  the ability of dealerships to offer an attractive selection of the most popular vehicles  the quality of customer service  and pricing including manufacturer rebates and other special offers 
in particular  pricing has become more important as a result of price savvy customers using sources available on the internet to determine current market retail prices 
other competitive factors include customer preference for makes of automobiles and manufacturer warranties 
in addition to competition for vehicle sales  we also compete with other auto dealers  service stores  auto parts retailers and independent mechanics in providing parts and service 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price  the use of factory approved replacement parts  factory trained technicians  the familiarity with a manufacturer s makes and models and the quality of customer service 
a number of regional and national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices 
in arranging or providing financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  financial institutions are now offering f i products through the internet  which may reduce our profits on these items 
we believe the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and contract terms 
our success depends  in part  on national and regional automobile buying trends  local and regional economic factors and other regional competitive pressures 
conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate  such as price cutting by dealers in these areas  or in any new markets we enter  could adversely affect us  even though the retail automobile industry as a whole might not be affected 
governmental regulations and environmental matters numerous federal and state regulations govern our business of marketing  selling  financing and servicing automobiles 
we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to business corporations 
under the laws of the states in which we currently operate as well as the laws of other states into which we may expand  we must obtain a license in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service 
these laws also regulate our conduct of business  including our sales  operating  advertising  financing and employment practices  including federal and state wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws 
our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth in lending  consumer privacy  consumer leasing and equal credit opportunity regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws  installment finance laws  usury laws and other installment sales laws 
some states regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales 
federal  state and local environmental regulations  including regulations governing air and water quality  the clean up of contaminated property and the use  storage  handling  recycling and disposal of gasoline  oil and other materials  also apply to us and our dealership properties 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with the laws affecting our business 
however  claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of laws may be asserted against us or our dealerships by individuals or governmental entities  and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties  including possible suspension or revocation of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service  parts and body shop operations in particular  our business involves the use  storage  handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials 
our business also involves the past and 
table of contents current operation and or removal of above ground and underground storage tanks containing such substances or wastes 
accordingly  we are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities that establish health and environmental quality standards  provide for liability related to those standards and  in certain circumstances  provide penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws  ordinances and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities we own or operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we do not have any known material environmental liabilities  and we believe that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
however  soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain properties owned and used by us 
further  environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change 
in addition  in connection with our past or future acquisitions  it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities  some of which may be material 
we cannot assure you that compliance with current or amended  or new or more stringent  laws or regulations  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures will not be material

item a risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  prospects and the prevailing market price and performance of our class a common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors  
table of contents including  but not limited to  the matters discussed below 
our stockholders and prospective investors should consider these risks  uncertainties  and other factors prior to making an investment decision 
risks related to our sources of financing and liquidity our significant indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial health  limit our ability to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations 
as of december   our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately billion  which includes floor plan notes payable  long term debt and short term debt 
we have million of maximum borrowing availability under a syndicated revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  up to million in maximum borrowing availability for new vehicle inventory floor plan financing and up to million in maximum borrowing availability for used vehicle inventory floor plan financing the floor plan facilities 
we refer to the revolving credit facility and floor plan facilities collectively as our credit facilities 
based on balances as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility based on the borrowing base calculation  which is affected by numerous factors including eligible asset balances and the market value of certain additional collateral 
we are able to borrow under our revolving credit facility only if  at the time of the borrowing  we have met all representations and warranties and are in compliance with all financial and other covenants contained therein 
we also have capacity to finance new and used vehicle inventory purchases under bilateral floor plan agreements with various manufacturer affiliated finance companies and other lending institutions the silo floor plan facilities as well as our floor plan facilities 
in addition  the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes due the notes  senior subordinated notes due the notes and our other debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  as long as we comply with the terms thereunder 
in addition  the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements that commonly have initial terms of fifteen to twenty years with renewal options ranging from five to ten years 
these operating leases require compliance with financial and operating covenants similar to those under our credit facilities  and monthly payments of rent that may fluctuate based on interest rates and local consumer price indices 
the total future minimum lease payments related to these operating leases and certain equipment leases are significant and are disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our failure to comply with certain covenants in these agreements or indentures could materially adversely affect our ability to access our borrowing capacity  subject us to acceleration of our outstanding debt  result in a cross default on other indebtedness  and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our business 
an acceleration of our obligation to repay all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness or lease obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our credit facilities  the indentures governing our notes and notes and many of our operating leases contain numerous financial and operating covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement or indenture 
if a default were to occur  we may be unable to adequately finance our operations and the value of our common stock would be materially adversely affected because of acceleration and cross default provisions 
in addition  a default under one agreement or indenture could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under the other agreements or indentures  including the indentures governing our outstanding notes and notes 
if a cross default were to occur  
table of contents we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms acceptable to us 
as a result of this risk  we could be forced to take actions that we otherwise would not take  or not take actions that we otherwise might take  in order to comply with the covenants in these agreements and indentures 
our ability to make interest and principal payments when due to holders of our debt securities depends upon our future performance 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  domestic and foreign economic conditions  the regulatory environment and other factors  many of which we are unable to control 
if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt as it becomes due  we may be required to refinance the debt  sell assets or sell shares of our common stock on terms that we do not find attractive 
further  our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to the credit facilities and the indentures pertaining to our outstanding notes could result in a default under these agreements that would prevent us from borrowing under the revolving credit facility  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if a default and acceleration of repayment were to occur  we may be unable to adequately finance our operations and the value of our class a common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we have financed the purchase of certain dealership properties with mortgage notes that require balloon payments at the end of the notes terms 
many of our mortgage notes principal and interest payments are based on an amortization period longer than the actual terms maturity dates of the notes 
we will be required to repay or refinance the remaining principal balances at the notes maturity dates balloon payments 
the maturity dates of these notes range from to the amounts to be repaid or refinanced at the maturity dates could be significant 
we may not have sufficient liquidity to make such payments at the notes maturity dates 
in the event we do have sufficient liquidity to completely repay the remaining principal balances at maturity  we may not be able to refinance the notes at interest rates that are acceptable to us  or depending on market conditions  refinance the notes at all 
our inability to repay or refinance these notes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to make interest and principal payments when due to holders of our debt securities depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries 
substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries and substantially all of our consolidated cash flow and net income are generated by our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our cash flow and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
we may receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends  loans or distributions 
we may use this cash to service our debt obligations or for working capital 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to distribute cash to us or to make funds available to service debt 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make loans to us is subject to minimum net capital requirements under manufacturer franchise and dealer agreements and laws of the state in which a subsidiary is organized and depends to a significant degree on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and other business considerations 
we depend on the performance of sublessees to offset costs related to certain of our lease agreements 
in most cases  when we sell a dealership  the buyer of the dealership will sublease the dealership property from us  but we are not released from the underlying lease obligation to the primary landlord 
we rely on the sublease income from the buyer to offset the expense incurred related to our obligation to pay the primary landlord 
we also rely on the buyer to maintain the property in accordance with the terms of the sublease which 
table of contents in most cases mirror the terms of the lease we have with the primary landlord 
although we assess the financial condition of a buyer at the time we sell the dealership  and seek to obtain guarantees of the buyer s sublease obligation from the stockholders or affiliates of the buyer  the financial condition of the buyer and or the sublease guarantors may deteriorate over time 
in the event the buyer does not perform under the terms of the sublease agreement due to the buyer s financial condition or other factors  we may not be able to recover amounts owed to us under the terms of the sublease agreement or the related guarantees 
our operating results  financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if sublessees do not perform their obligations under the terms of the sublease agreements 
our use of hedging transactions could limit our financial gains or result in financial losses 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flow due to interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into  and in the future expect to enter into  derivative instruments or hedging agreements 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
see the heading derivative instruments and hedging activities under note  long term debt  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions 
our hedging transactions expose us to certain risks and financial losses  including  among other things counterparty credit risk  available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection  the duration of the amount of the hedge may not match the duration or amount of the related liability  the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value  downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  which would affect our stockholders equity  and all of our hedging instruments contain terms and conditions with which we are required to meet 
in the event those terms and conditions are not met  we may be required to settle the instruments prior to the instruments maturity with cash payments which could significantly affect our liquidity 
a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations upon the occurrence of a change in control or a fundamental change 
upon the occurrence of a change in control or a fundamental change  as defined in our notes and notes  holders of these instruments will have the right to require us to purchase all or any part of such holders notes at a price equal to of principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the events that constitute a change of control under these indentures may also constitute a default under our credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient resources available to satisfy all of our obligations under these debt instruments in the event of a change in control or fundamental change 
in the event we were unable to satisfy these obligations  it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our common stock holders 
any future debt instruments that we may incur may contain similar provisions regarding repurchases in the event of a change in control or fundamental change triggering event 

table of contents although mr 
o 
bruton smith  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his affiliates have previously assisted us with obtaining financing  we cannot assure you that he or they will be willing or able to do so in the future 
our obligations under the credit facilities are secured with a pledge of  shares of smi common stock 
these shares of smi common stock are owned by sonic financial corporation sfc  an entity controlled by mr 
o 
bruton smith 
presently  the million borrowing limit of our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation that is based  in part  on the value of the smi shares pledged by sfc 
consequently  a withdrawal of this pledge by sfc or a significant decrease in the value of smi common stock could reduce the amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to december   we finalized an amendment to our credit facilities that  among other things  removed the pledge of  shares of smi common stock as security under the revolving credit facility  which could reduce our borrowing availability and therefore could reduce our liquidity 
risks related to our relationships with vehicle manufacturers our operations may be adversely affected if one or more of our manufacturer franchise or dealer agreements is terminated or not renewed 
each of our dealerships operates under a separate franchise or dealer agreement with the applicable automobile manufacturer 
without a franchise or dealer agreement  we cannot obtain new vehicles from a manufacturer or advertise as an authorized factory service center 
as a result  we are significantly dependent on our relationships with the manufacturers 
moreover  manufacturers exercise a great degree of control over the operations of our dealerships through the franchise and dealer agreements 
the franchise and dealer agreements govern  among other things  our ability to purchase vehicles from the manufacturer and to sell vehicles to customers 
each of our franchise or dealer agreements provides for termination or non renewal for a variety of causes  including certain changes in the financial condition of the dealerships and any unapproved change of ownership or management 
manufacturers may also have a right of first refusal if we seek to sell dealerships 
we cannot guarantee that any of our existing franchise and dealer agreements will be renewed or that the terms and conditions of such renewals will be favorable to us 
actions taken by manufacturers to exploit their superior bargaining position in negotiating the terms of franchise and dealer agreements or renewals of these agreements or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our failure to meet a manufacturer s customer satisfaction  financial and sales performance and facility requirements may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to acquire new dealerships 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their sales and warranty service experiences through manufacturer determined csi scores 
the components of csi vary by manufacturer and are modified periodically 
franchise and dealer agreements may also impose financial and sales performance standards 
under our agreements with certain manufacturers  a dealership s csi scores  sales and financial performance may be considered a factor in evaluating applications for additional dealership acquisitions 
from time to time  some of our dealerships have had difficulty meeting various manufacturers csi requirements or performance standards 
we cannot assure you that our dealerships will be able to comply with these requirements in the future 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to an acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its csi requirements or performance standards  which could impair the execution of our acquisition strategy 
in addition  we receive incentive payments from the manufacturers based  in part  on csi scores  which could be materially adversely affected if our csi scores decline 
in addition  a manufacturer may condition its allotment of vehicles  participation in bonus programs  or acquisition of additional franchises upon our compliance with its facility standards 
this may put us in a 
table of contents competitive disadvantage with other competing dealerships and may ultimately result in our decision to sell a franchise when we believe it may be difficult to recover the cost of the required investment to reach the manufacturer s facility standards 
if state dealer laws are repealed or weakened  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their franchise and dealer agreements 
state dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise or dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws 
if dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of state dealer laws  it may also be more difficult for our dealerships to renew their franchise or dealer agreements upon expiration 
in addition  these laws restrict the ability of automobile manufacturers to directly enter the retail market in the future 
however  the ability of a manufacturer to grant additional franchises is based on several factors which are not within our control 
if manufacturers grant new franchises in areas near or within our existing markets  this could significantly impact our revenues and or profitability 
further  if manufacturers obtain the ability to directly retail vehicles and do so in our markets  such competition could have a material adverse effect on us 
our sales volume and profit margin on each sale may be materially adversely affected if manufacturers discontinue or change their incentive programs 
our dealerships depend on the manufacturers for certain sales incentives  warranties and other programs that are intended to promote and support dealership new vehicle sales 
manufacturers routinely modify their incentive programs in response to changing market conditions 
some of the key incentive programs include customer rebates or below market financing on new and used vehicles  employee pricing  dealer incentives on new vehicles  manufacturer floor plan interest and advertising assistance  warranties on new and used vehicles  and sponsorship of certified pre owned vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
manufacturers frequently offer incentives to potential customers 
a reduction or discontinuation of a manufacturer s incentive programs may materially adversely impact vehicle demand and affect our profitability 
our sales volume may be materially adversely affected if manufacturer captives change their customer financing programs or are unable to provide floor plan financing 
one of the primary finance sources used by consumers in connection with the purchase of a new or used vehicle is the manufacturer captive finance companies 
these captive finance companies rely  to a certain extent  on the public debt markets to provide the capital necessary to support their financing programs 
in addition  the captive finance companies will occasionally change their loan underwriting criteria to alter the risk profile of their loan portfolio 
a limitation or reduction of available consumer financing for these or other reasons could affect consumers ability to purchase a vehicle  and thus  could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume 

table of contents our parts and service sales volume and profitability are dependent on manufacturer warranty programs 
franchised automotive retailers perform factory authorized service work and sell original replacement parts on vehicles covered by warranties issued by the automotive manufacturer 
dealerships which perform work covered by a manufacturer warranty are reimbursed at rates established by the manufacturer 
for the year ended december   approximately of our parts  service and collision repair revenue was for work covered by manufacturer warranties 
to the extent a manufacturer reduces the labor rates or markup of replacement parts for such warranty work  our fixed operations sales volume and profitability could be adversely affected 
adverse conditions affecting one or more key manufacturers or lenders may negatively impact our profitability 
our business is dependent upon the products  services  and financing and incentive programs offered by major automobile manufacturers  and could be negatively impacted by any significant changes to these manufacturers financial condition  marketing  vehicle design  publicity concerning a particular manufacturer or vehicle model  production capabilities  management  reputation  and labor relations 
events such as labor strikes or other disruptions in production  including those caused by natural disasters  that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely affect us 
in particular  labor strikes at a manufacturer that continue for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business 
similarly  the delivery of vehicles from manufacturers at a time later than scheduled  which may occur during critical periods of new product introductions  could limit sales of those vehicles during those periods 
this has been experienced at some of our dealerships from time to time 
adverse conditions affecting these and other important aspects of manufacturers operations and public relations may adversely affect our ability to sell their automobiles and  as a result  significantly and detrimentally affect our business and profitability 
moreover  our business could be materially adversely impacted by the bankruptcy of a major vehicle manufacturer or related lender 
for example a manufacturer in bankruptcy could attempt to terminate all or certain of our franchises  in which case we may not receive adequate compensation for our franchises  consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be substantially reduced  a lender in bankruptcy could attempt to terminate our floorplan financing and demand repayment of any amounts outstanding  we may be unable to arrange financing for our customers for their vehicle purchases and leases through such lender  in which case we would be required to seek financing with alternate financing sources  which may be difficult to obtain on similar terms  if at all  we may be unable to collect some or all of our significant receivables that are due from such manufacturer or lender  and we may be subject to preference claims relating to payments made by such manufacturer or lender prior to bankruptcy  and such manufacturer may be relieved of its indemnification obligations with respect to product liability claims 

table of contents additionally  any such bankruptcy may result in us being required to incur impairment charges with respect to the inventory  fixed assets and intangible assets related to certain dealerships  which could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and our ability to remain in compliance with the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements 
manufacturer stock ownership restrictions may impair our ability to maintain or renew franchise or dealer agreements or issue additional equity 
some of our franchise and dealer agreements prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership and  in some cases  its parent  without prior approval of the applicable manufacturer 
our existing franchise and dealer agreements could be terminated if a person or entity acquires a substantial ownership interest in us or acquires voting power above certain levels without the applicable manufacturer s approval 
while the holders of our class b common stock currently maintain voting control of sonic  their future investment decisions as well as those of holders of our class a common stock are generally outside of our control and could result in the termination or non renewal of existing franchise or dealer agreements or impair our ability to negotiate new franchise or dealer agreements for dealerships we acquire in the future 
in addition  if we cannot obtain any requisite approvals on a timely basis  we may not be able to issue additional equity or otherwise raise capital on terms acceptable to us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter a prospective acquirer from acquiring control of us 
we depend on manufacturers to supply us with sufficient numbers of popular and profitable new models 
manufacturers typically allocate their vehicles among dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership 
supplies of popular new vehicles may be limited by the applicable manufacturer s production capabilities 
popular new vehicles that are in limited supply typically produce the highest profit margins 
we depend on manufacturers to provide us with a desirable mix of popular new vehicles 
our operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not obtain a sufficient supply of these vehicles on a timely basis 
a decline in the quality of vehicles we sell  or consumers perception of the quality of those vehicles  may adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
events such as manufacturer recalls  negative publicity or legal proceedings related to these events may have a negative impact on the products we sell 
if such events are significant  the profitability of our dealerships related to those manufacturers could be adversely affected and we could experience a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
risks related to our growth strategy our ability to make acquisitions is restricted pursuant to the terms of the credit facilities 
pursuant to the credit facilities  we are restricted from making dealership acquisitions in any fiscal year if the aggregate cost of all such acquisitions occurring in any fiscal year is in excess of million  or if the aggregate cost of such acquisitions is in excess of million during the term of the agreement  without the written consent of the required lenders as that term is defined in the credit facilities 
with this restriction on our ability to make acquisitions  our growth strategy may be limited 
in addition  we may have to forfeit the opportunity to acquire profitable dealerships at attractive valuations 
we may not be able to capitalize on future real estate and dealership acquisition opportunities because our ability to obtain capital to fund these acquisitions is limited 
we intend to finance future real estate and dealership acquisitions with cash generated from operations  through issuances of our stock or debt securities and through borrowings under credit arrangements 
we may not 
table of contents be able to obtain additional financing by issuing stock or debt securities due to the market price of our class a common stock  overall market conditions or covenants under our credit facilities that restrict our ability to issue additional indebtedness  or the need for manufacturer consent to the issuance of equity securities 
using cash to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operating or financial flexibility 
in addition  we are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to finance our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory with floor plan financing 
floor plan financing arrangements allow us to borrow money to buy a particular new vehicle from the manufacturer or a used vehicle on trade in or at auction and pay off the loan when we sell that particular vehicle 
we must obtain floor plan financing or obtain consents to assume existing floor plan financing in connection with our acquisition of dealerships 
in the event that we are unable to obtain such financing  our ability to complete dealership acquisitions could be limited 
substantially all the assets of our dealerships are pledged to secure the indebtedness under our silo floor plan facilities and the credit facilities 
these pledges may impede our ability to borrow from other sources 
moreover  because the identified manufacturer affiliated finance subsidiaries are either owned by or affiliated with bmw  mercedes  ford  toyota and volkswagen  respectively  any deterioration of our relationship with the particular manufacturer affiliated finance subsidiary could adversely affect our relationship with the affiliated manufacturer  and vice versa 
manufacturers restrictions on acquisitions could limit our future growth 
we are required to obtain the approval of the applicable manufacturer before we can acquire an additional franchise of that manufacturer 
in determining whether to approve an acquisition  manufacturers may consider many factors such as our financial condition and csi scores 
certain manufacturers also limit the number of its dealerships that we may own  our national market share of that manufacturer s products or the number of dealerships we may own in a particular geographic area 
in addition  under an applicable franchise or dealer agreement or under state law  a manufacturer may have a right of first refusal to acquire a dealership that we seek to acquire 
a manufacturer may condition approval of an acquisition on the implementation of material changes in our operations or extraordinary corporate transactions  facilities improvements or other capital expenditures 
if we are unable or unwilling to comply with these conditions  we may be required to sell the assets of that manufacturer s dealerships or terminate our franchise or dealer agreement 
we cannot assure you that manufacturers will approve future acquisitions or do so on a timely basis  which could impair the execution of our acquisition strategy 
failure to effectively integrate acquired dealerships with our existing operations could adversely affect our future operating results 
our future operating results depend on our ability to integrate the operations of acquired dealerships with our existing operations 
in particular  we need to integrate our management information systems  procedures and organizational structures  which can be difficult 
our growth strategy has focused on the pursuit of strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement our business 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively and profitably integrate the operations of these dealerships without substantial costs  delays or operational or financial problems  due to the difficulties of managing operations located in geographic areas where we have not previously operated  the management time and attention required to integrate and manage newly acquired dealerships  the difficulties of assimilating and retaining employees  
table of contents the challenges of keeping customers  and the challenge of retaining or attracting appropriate dealership management personnel 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not adequately anticipate all of the demands that growth through acquisitions will impose 
we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions or expansion 
these risks include  but are not limited to incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of acquired dealerships  entering new markets with which we are unfamiliar  potential undiscovered liabilities and operational difficulties at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business  diverting our management resources  failing to maintain uniform standards  controls and policies  impairing relationships with employees  manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management  increased expenses for accounting and computer systems  as well as integration difficulties  failure to obtain a manufacturer s consent to the acquisition of one or more of its franchises or renew the franchise or dealer agreement on terms acceptable to us  and incorrectly valuing entities to be acquired or assessing markets entered 
we may not adequately anticipate all of the demands that growth will impose on our business 
we may not be able to execute our growth strategy without the costs escalating 
we have grown our business primarily through acquisitions in the past 
we may not be able to consummate any future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms or identify suitable candidates 
in addition  increased competition for acquisition candidates could result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us and higher acquisition prices 
the magnitude  timing  pricing and nature of future acquisitions or growth opportunities will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  competition with other dealer groups for suitable acquisitions  the negotiation of acceptable terms with the seller and with the manufacturer  our financial capabilities and ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  our stock price  and the availability of skilled employees to manage the acquired companies 
we may not be able to determine the actual financial condition of dealerships we acquire until after we complete the acquisition and take control of the dealerships 
the operating and financial condition of acquired businesses cannot be determined accurately until we assume control 
although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the 
table of contents operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase  in light of the circumstances of each transaction  an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses 
similarly  many of the dealerships we acquire  including some of our largest acquisitions  do not have financial statements audited or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we may not have an accurate understanding of the historical financial condition and performance of our acquired entities 
until we actually assume control of business assets and their operations  we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations 
risks related to the automotive retail industry increasing competition among automotive retailers and the use of the internet reduces our profit margins on vehicle sales and related businesses 
automobile retailing is a highly competitive business 
our competitors include publicly and privately owned dealerships  some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
many of our competitors sell the same or similar makes of new and used vehicles that we offer in our markets at competitive prices 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers due to economies of scale or otherwise 
we typically rely on advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation and dealership location to sell new vehicles 
our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected if manufacturers decide to enter the retail market directly 
our f i business and other related businesses  which have higher margins than sales of new and used vehicles  are subject to strong competition from various financial institutions and other third parties 
moreover  customers are using the internet to compare pricing for vehicles and related f i services  which may further reduce margins for new and used vehicles and profits for related f i services 
if internet new vehicle sales are allowed to be conducted without the involvement of franchised dealers  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  other dealership groups have aligned themselves with services offered on the internet or are investing heavily in the development of their own internet capabilities  which could materially adversely affect our business 
our franchise and dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues or profitability could be materially adversely affected if any of our manufacturers award franchises to others in the same markets where we operate or if existing franchised dealers increase their market share in our markets 
we may face increasingly significant competition as we strive to gain market share through acquisitions or otherwise 
our operating margins may decline over time as we expand into markets where we do not have a leading position 
our dealers depend upon new vehicle sales and  therefore  their success depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicles they carry 
the success of our dealerships depends in large part on the overall success of the vehicle lines they carry 
new vehicle sales generate the majority of our total revenue and lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance  insurance  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products  and parts and service operations 
our new vehicle sales operations are comprised primarily of luxury and mid line import brands  which exposes us to manufacturer concentration risks 
although our parts and service operations and used vehicle sales may serve to offset some of this risk  changes in automobile manufacturers vehicle models and customer demand for particular vehicles may have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our business will be harmed if overall consumer demand suffers from a severe or sustained downturn 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences 
retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on economic conditions  consumer confidence  the level of discretionary personal income and credit availability 
deterioration in any of these conditions may have a material adverse effect on our retail business  particularly sales of new and used automobiles 
in addition  severe or sustained increases in gasoline prices may lead to a reduction in automobile purchases or a shift in buying patterns from luxury and sport utility vehicle models which typically provide higher margins to retailers to smaller  more economical vehicles which typically have lower margins 
a decline of available financing in the lending market may adversely affect our vehicle sales volume 
a significant portion of vehicle buyers  particularly in the used car market  finance their purchases of automobiles 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing for consumers who  for a variety of reasons including poor credit histories and lack of down payment  do not have access to more traditional finance sources 
in the event lenders tighten their credit standards or there is a decline in the availability of credit in the lending market  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues and profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions and foreign trade risks that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles profitably 
a significant portion of our new vehicle business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  import duties  exchange controls  trade restrictions  work stoppages and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
natural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business 
our dealerships are concentrated in states and regions in the united states  including florida  texas and california  in which actual or threatened natural disasters and severe weather events such as hurricanes  earthquakes  fires  floods  landslides  and hail storms may disrupt our store operations  which may adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition to business interruption  the automotive retailing business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property values at store locations 
although we have substantial insurance  subject to certain deductibles  limitations  and exclusions  we may be exposed to uninsured or underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  the automotive manufacturing supply chain spans the globe 
as such  supply chain disruptions resulting from natural disasters and adverse weather events may affect the flow of inventory or parts to us or our manufacturing partners 
such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability  which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 
we have invested in internal and external business applications to execute our strategy of employing technology 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and store sensitive data  including intellectual 
table of contents property  our proprietary business information and that of our customers  suppliers and business partners  and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees 
although we have attempted to mitigate the cyber security risk of both our internal and outsourced functions by implementing various cyber security controls and evaluating the cyber security controls of our third party technology and systems partners  we remain subject to cyber security risks 
these cyber security risks include  but are not limited to vulnerability to cyber attack of our internal or externally hosted business applications  interruption of service or access to systems may affect our ability to deliver vehicles or complete transactions with customers  unauthorized access or theft of customer or employee personal confidential information  disruption of communications both internally and externally that may affect the quality of information used to make informed business decisions  damage to our reputation as a result of a breach in security that affected the financial security of our customers  unauthorized access to strategically sensitive data  and unauthorized access to financial accounts 
moreover  significant technology related business functions of ours are outsourced  including payroll and human resources management systems  customer relationship management  dealer management and financial reporting systems  inventory management system  consumer credit application management  e commerce hosting  marketing campaign management  fund transfers ach online banking  expense reimbursement management  ip telephony  and wan lan administration switch router configuration 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions 
any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed  publicly disclosed  lost or stolen 
any such access  disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings  liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information  regulatory penalties  damage our reputation  and cause a loss of confidence in our services  which could materially adversely affect our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents general risks related to investing in our securities concentration of voting power and anti takeover provisions of our charter  bylaws  delaware law and our franchise and dealer agreements may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control 
our common stock is divided into two classes with different voting rights 
this dual class stock ownership allows the present holders of the class b common stock to control us 
holders of class a common stock have one vote per share on all matters 
holders of class b common stock have votes per share on all matters  except that they have only one vote per share on any transaction proposed or approved by the board of directors or a class b common stockholder or otherwise benefiting the class b common stockholders constituting a going private transaction  disposition of substantially all of our assets  transfer resulting in a change in the nature of our business  or merger or consolidation in which current holders of common stock would own less than of the common stock following such transaction 
the holders of class b common stock which include o 
bruton smith  sonic s chairman  chief executive officer and director  his family members and entities they control currently hold less than a majority of our outstanding common stock  but a majority of our voting power 
this may prevent or discourage a change of control of us even if the action was favored by holders of class a common stock 
our charter and bylaws make it more difficult for our stockholders to take corporate actions at stockholders meetings 
in addition  stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under our stock incentive plan and stock incentive plan become immediately exercisable or automatically vest upon a change in control 
delaware law also makes it difficult for stockholders who have recently acquired a large interest in a company to consummate a business combination transaction with the company against its directors wishes 
finally  restrictions imposed by our franchise and dealer agreements may impede or prevent any potential takeover bid 
our franchise and dealer agreements allow the manufacturers the right to terminate the agreements upon a change of control of our company and impose restrictions upon the transferability of any significant percentage of our stock to any one person or entity that may be unqualified  as defined by the manufacturer  to own one of its dealerships 
the inability of a person or entity to qualify with one or more of our manufacturers may prevent or seriously impede a potential takeover bid 
in addition  there may be provisions of our lending arrangements that create an event of default upon a change in control 
these agreements  corporate governance documents and laws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or preventing stockholders from realizing a premium on the sale of their shares if we were acquired 
the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse effect on our future business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including regulatory investigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified 
although we vigorously defend ourselves in all legal and administrative proceedings  the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 

table of contents our business may be adversely affected by claims alleging violations of laws and regulations in our advertising  sales and finance and insurance activities 
our business is highly regulated 
in the past several years  private plaintiffs and state attorney generals have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
the conduct of our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding unfair  deceptive and or fraudulent trade practices including advertising  marketing  sales  insurance  repair and promotion practices  truth in lending  consumer leasing  fair credit practices  equal credit opportunity  privacy  insurance  motor vehicle finance  installment finance  closed end credit  usury and other installment sales 
claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or any of our dealers by individuals  either individually or through class actions  or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings 
such actions may expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchise or dealer agreements to conduct dealership operations 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our performance is subject to local economic  competitive  weather and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate 
we may not be able to expand geographically and any geographic expansion may not adequately insulate us from the adverse effects of local or regional economic conditions 
in addition  due to the provisions and terms contained in our operating lease agreements  we may not be able to relocate a dealership operation to a more favorable location without incurring significant costs or penalties 
the loss of key personnel and limited management and personnel resources could adversely affect our operations and growth 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team  particularly our senior management  and service and sales personnel 
additionally  franchise or dealer agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers 
we do not have employment agreements with certain members of our senior management team  our dealership managers and other key dealership personnel 
consequently  the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  as we expand  we may need to hire additional managers 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the lack of qualified management or employees employed by potential acquisition candidates may limit our ability to consummate future acquisitions 
governmental regulation and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  such as local licensing requirements  retail financing and consumer protection laws and regulations  and wage hour  anti discrimination and other employment practices laws and regulations 
our facilities and operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety  including those governing wastewater discharges  air emissions  the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks  the use  storage  treatment  transportation  release  recycling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated property or water 
the violation of these laws and regulations can result in administrative  civil or criminal penalties against us or in a cease and desist order against our operations that are not in compliance 
our future acquisitions may also be subject to regulation  
table of contents including antitrust reviews 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with all laws and regulations applicable to our business  but future regulations may be more stringent and require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
our past and present business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required by these laws to pay the full amount of the costs of investigation and or remediation of contaminated properties  even if we are not at fault for disposal of the materials or if such disposal was legal at the time 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  soil and groundwater contamination exists at certain of our properties 
we cannot assure you that our other properties have not been or will not become similarly contaminated 
in addition  we could become subject to potentially material new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities because of our acquisitions 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles we sell 
the us environmental protection agency epa has adopted rules under existing provisions of the federal clean air act that require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles  require certain construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources  and require monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources on an annual basis 
the adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases from our operations or on vehicles and automotive fuels in the united states could adversely affect demand for those vehicles and require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations 
potential conflicts of interest between us and our officers or directors could adversely affect our future performance 
mr 
o 
bruton smith serves as the chairman and chief executive officer of smi 
accordingly  we compete with smi for the management time of mr 
smith 
we have in the past and will likely in the future enter into transactions with mr 
smith  entities controlled by mr 
smith or our other affiliates 
we believe that all of our existing arrangements with affiliates are as favorable to us as if the arrangements were negotiated between unaffiliated parties  although the majority of these transactions have neither been verified by third parties in that regard nor are likely to be so verified in the future 
potential conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us and our officers or directors in the enforcement  amendment or termination of arrangements existing between them 
we may be subject to substantial withdrawal liability assessments in the future related to a multi employer pension plan to which certain of our dealerships make contributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
six of our dealership subsidiaries in northern california currently make fixed dollar contributions to the automotive industries pension plan the ai pension plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements between our subsidiaries and the international association of machinists the iam and the international brotherhood of teamsters the ibt 
the ai pension plan is a multi employer pension plan as defined under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  and our six dealership subsidiaries are among approximately employers that make contributions to the ai pension plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements with the iam and ibt 
in june  we received information that the ai pension plan was substantially underfunded as of december  in july  we received updated information that the ai pension plan continued to be substantially underfunded as of december   with the amount of such underfunding increasing versus year end in march  the board of trustees of the ai pension plan 
table of contents notified participants  participating employers and local unions that the ai pension plan s actuary  in accordance with the requirements of the federal pension protection act of  had issued a certification that the ai pension plan is in critical status effective with the plan year commencing january  as of april  the ai pension plan remained in critical status for the plan year beginning january  in conjunction with the ai pension plan s critical status  the board of trustees of the ai pension plan adopted a rehabilitation plan that implements reductions or eliminations of certain adjustable benefits that were previously available under the ai pension plan including some forms of early retirement benefits  and disability and death benefits  among other items  and also implements a requirement on all participating employers to increase employer contributions to the ai pension plan for a seven year period commencing in under applicable federal law  any employer contributing to a multi employer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan 
in certain circumstances  an employer can be assessed withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
in addition  if the financial condition of the ai pension plan were to continue to deteriorate to the point that the ai pension plan is forced to terminate and be administered by the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc  the participating employers could be subject to assessments by the pbgc to cover the participating employers assessed share of the unfunded vested benefits 
if any of these adverse events were to occur in the future  it could result in a substantial withdrawal liability assessment that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a change in historical experience and or assumptions used to estimate reserves could have a material impact on our earnings 
as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations use of estimates and critical accounting policies  management relies on estimates in various areas of accounting and financial reporting 
for example  our estimates for finance  insurance and service contracts and insurance reserves are based on historical experience and assumptions 
differences between actual results and our historical experiences and or our assumptions could have a material impact on our earnings in the period of the change and in periods subsequent to the change 
our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective 
during the process of completing the audit of our financial statements for the period ended december   management became aware of the existence of a material weakness and significant deficiencies in the designs and operations of the internal control over financial reporting that could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with our assertions in the financial statements 
we may also identify additional material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in the future 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments  we could incur further remediation costs  we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls  or fail to meet our reporting obligations under sec regulations and the terms of our debt agreements on a timely basis and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock 
impairment of our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
pursuant to applicable accounting pronouncements  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we describe the process for testing goodwill more thoroughly in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations use of estimates and critical accounting policies 
if we determine that the amount of our goodwill is impaired at any point in time  we are required to reduce goodwill on our balance sheet 
if goodwill of our single reporting unit is impaired based on a future impairment test  we will be required to record a significant non cash impairment 
table of contents charge that may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment of goodwill occurs 
as of december   our balance sheet reflected a carrying amount of approximately million in goodwill 
item b unresolved staff comments none 
item properties 
our principal executive offices are located at a property owned by us at colwick road  charlotte  north carolina   and our telephone number is our dealerships are generally located along major us or interstate highways 
one of the principal factors we consider in evaluating an acquisition candidate is its location 
we prefer to acquire dealerships or build dealership facilities located along major thoroughfares  which can be easily visited by prospective customers 
we lease the majority of the properties utilized by our dealership operations from affiliates of capital automotive reit and other individuals and entities 
under the terms of our franchise and dealer agreements  each of our dealerships must maintain an appropriate appearance and design of its dealership facility and is restricted in its ability to relocate 
the properties utilized by our dealership operations that are owned by us or one of our subsidiaries are pledged as security for our credit facilities or mortgage financing arrangements 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs

overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of december   we operated dealerships in states representing different brands of cars and light trucks and collision repair centers 
for management and operational reporting purposes  we group certain dealerships together that share management and inventory principally used vehicles into stores 
as of december   we operated stores 
as a result of the way we manage our business  we have a single operating segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  manufacturer warranty repairs  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended service contracts  financing  insurance and other aftermarket products for our customers 
although vehicle sales and sales of associated finance  insurance and other aftermarket products are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including overall economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not as dependent upon near term sales volume 
the automobile industry s total amount of new vehicles sold in increased by  to million vehicles  from million vehicles in  according to bloomberg financial markets  via stephens inc from an industry perspective  new vehicle unit sales on a year over year basis increased for import brands and for domestic brands 
for  the average industry expectations for new vehicle unit sales volume are between million and million vehicles  an increase of to from the industry volume in changes in consumer confidence  availability of consumer financing or changes in the financial stability of the automotive manufacturers could cause new vehicle industry results to vary 
many factors such as brand and geographic concentrations have caused our past results to differ from the industry s overall trend 

table of contents use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the following is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance  insurance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or extended service contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates  termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at december  by approximately million 
our estimate of chargebacks approximately million as of december  is influenced by early contract termination events such as vehicle repossessions  refinancings and early pay offs 
if these factors negatively change  the resulting impact would affect our future estimate for chargebacks and could have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial position and cash flows 
our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates 
goodwill and franchise assets in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other  in the asc  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
the asc also states that if an entity determines  based on an assessment of certain qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary 
even though the asc allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired  we believe that it is prudent to conduct a quantitative step one assessment at least every three years  or as circumstances require 
therefore  since our last quantitative assessment was performed as of december   we elected to perform a quantitative step one assessment as of december  we utilized a discounted cash flows dcf model to estimate sonic s enterprise value 
the significant assumptions in our dcf model include projected earnings  weighted average cost of capital and estimates in the weighted average cost of capital inputs and residual growth rates 
to the extent the reporting unit s earnings decline significantly or there are changes in one or more of these assumptions that would result in lower 
table of contents valuation results  it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require us to conduct the second step of the impairment test described above 
in projecting our reporting unit s earnings  we develop many assumptions which include  but are not limited to  new and used vehicle unit sales  internal revenue enhancement initiatives  cost control initiatives  internal investment programs such as training and technology  infrastructure and inventory floor plan borrowing rates 
our expectation of new vehicle unit sales is in part driven by our expectation of the new vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales saar 
the estimate of the industry saar in future periods is the basis of our assumptions related to new vehicle unit sales volumes in our dcf model because we believe the historic and projected saar level of the saar is the best indicator of growth or contraction in the retail automotive industry 
the level of saar assumed in our projection of earnings for was approximately million units with moderate increases over the next few years 
our dcf model estimated a fair value of more than billion in excess of carrying value as of december  our dcf model is dependent on the assumptions used and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
in order to determine the effects of changes in our assumptions on our dcf model  and consequently our goodwill valuation  we ran multiple scenarios adjusting our earnings before interest and taxes ebit growth factors  weighted average cost of capital  and cost synergy assumptions 
in the event the weighted average cost of capital increased by basis points  assuming all other factors remain the same  the calculated fair value estimate as of december  would change by approximately million 
although we assumed a ebit growth factor in our model  in the event ebit is flat  assuming all other factors remain the same  the calculated fair value estimate as of december  would change by approximately million 
in the event ebit is flat and no cost synergies are realized  assuming all other factors remain the same  the calculated fair value estimate as of december  would change by approximately million 
based on our dcf model  none of the scenarios tested  if realized  would have resulted in lowering the fair value of the reporting unit below the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on the results of our step one test as of december   sonic s fair value exceeds its carrying value 
as such  we were not required to complete step two of the impairment evaluation according to intangibles goodwill and other  in the asc 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the balance of our goodwill totaled approximately million at december  in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other  in the asc  we evaluate franchise assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we estimate the value of our franchise assets using a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model used contains inherent uncertainties 
we are subject to financial risk to the extent that our franchise assets become impaired due to deterioration of the underlying businesses 
the risk of a franchise asset impairment loss may increase to the extent the underlying businesses earnings or projected earnings decline 
as a result of our impairment testing for the years ended december   and  no franchise asset impairments were required 
the balance of our franchise assets totaled approximately million at december  insurance reserves we have various high deductible retention and insurance policies that require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these policies 
we accrue for insurance reserves throughout the year based on current information available 
as of december   we estimate the ultimate liability under these programs is between million and million  and had approximately million reserved for such programs 
changes in significant assumptions used in the development of the ultimate liability for these programs could have a material impact on the level of reserves  our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
these significant assumptions would include the volume of claims  medical cost trends  claims handling and reporting patterns  historical claims experience  the effect of related court rulings and current or projected changes in state laws 
from a sensitivity analysis perspective  it is difficult to quantify the effect of changes in any of these significant assumptions with the exception of the volume of claims 
we 
table of contents believe a change in the volume of claims would have a proportional effect on our reserves 
our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates 
lease exit accruals the majority of our dealership properties are leased under long term operating lease arrangements 
when leased properties are no longer utilized in operations  we record lease exit accruals 
these situations could include the relocation of an existing facility or the sale of a dealership where the buyer will not be subleasing the property for either the remaining term of the lease or for an amount equal to our obligation under the lease  or in situations where a store is closed as a result of the associated franchise being terminated by the manufacturer and no other operations continue on the leased property 
the lease exit accruals represent the present value of the lease payments  net of estimated sublease rentals  for the remaining life of the operating leases and other accruals necessary to satisfy lease commitments to the landlords 
as of december   we had million accrued for lease exit costs 
a significant change in our assumptions regarding the time period necessary to obtain a subtenant or the amount of the anticipated sublease income could have a material effect on our accrual and  as a result  earnings 
for example  assuming all other factors remain the same  a decrease in our estimated proceeds from subleases would change our lease exit accruals by approximately million 
in addition  based on the terms and conditions negotiated in the sale of dealerships in the future  additional accruals may be necessary if the purchaser of the dealership does not assume any associated lease  or we are unable to negotiate a sublease with the buyer of the dealership on terms that are identical to or better than those associated with the original lease 
legal proceedings we are involved  and expect to continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
as of december   we had accrued approximately million in legal reserves 
although we vigorously defend ourselves in all legal and administrative proceedings  the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters that are significant could exceed the amount of our legal reserve and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 
classification of dealerships in continuing and discontinued operations we classify the results from operations of our continuing and discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income based on the provisions of presentation of financial statements in the asc 
many of these provisions involve judgment in determining whether a dealership will be reported as continuing or discontinued operations 
such judgments include whether a dealership will be sold or terminated  the period required to complete the disposition and the likelihood of changes to a plan for sale 
if in future periods we determine that a dealership should be either reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations or from discontinued operations to continuing operations  previously reported consolidated statements of income will be reclassified in order to reflect that classification 
at december   there were no dealerships classified as held for sale 
income taxes as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we believe that our tax positions comply  in all material respects  with applicable tax law and that we have provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in 
table of contents which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities  as well as changes in tax laws  regulations and precedent 
at december   there was approximately million in reserves that we have provided for these matters including estimates related to possible interest and penalties included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the effects on our financial statements of income tax uncertainties are discussed in note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review all deferred tax asset positions including state net operating loss carryforwards to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
certain factors considered in evaluating the potential for realization of deferred tax assets include the time remaining until expiration related to state net operating loss carryforwards and various sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit related to a deferred tax asset 
this evaluation requires management to make certain assumptions about future profitability  the execution of tax strategies that may be available to us and the likelihood that these assumptions or execution of tax strategies would occur 
this evaluation is highly judgmental 
the results of future operations  regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
therefore  actual realization of these deferred tax assets may be materially different from management s estimate 
as of december  and  we had a valuation allowance recorded totaling million and million  respectively  related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards because we concluded it was likely that we would not be able to generate sufficient state taxable income in the related entities to realize the accumulated net operating loss carryforward balances 
during the year ended december   sonic lowered the recorded valuation allowance amount related to its deferred tax asset balances by approximately million related to the settlement of a state tax examination and certain tax planning that will allow sonic to realize certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
during the year ended december   we reduced the recorded valuation allowance amount by approximately million 
this change was the result of the use of certain state net operating loss carryforwards as well as a change in estimate that we would be able to ultimately realize the benefits of recorded deferred tax balances 
this change in estimate was primarily driven by the improvement experienced in our operating results  the overall improvement of the automotive retailing industry and the expectation that our results and those of the automotive retailing industry would continue to improve in the future 
we accrue for income taxes on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on the expected year end liability 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are updated quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns  changes in income tax law  our income tax strategies and other factors 
if our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year end liability  the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update the amends the accounting guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendments in this accounting standard update are intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 
the amendments also enhance the consistency of impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset s fair value when testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment  which is similar to the impairment testing requirements for other long lived assets 
the amendments in this accounting standard update are effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we do not expect this accounting standard update to have a material effect on our impairment test or disclosures

we did not dispose of any dealerships during the year ended december   and disposed of seven dealerships during the year ended december  the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
the following discussions are based on reported figures 
same store amounts do not vary significantly from reported totals since there were no significant dealership acquisitions in the years ended december   and new vehicles new vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles to retail customers  as well as the sale of fleet vehicles 
new vehicle revenues can be influenced by on manufacturer incentives for consumers  which vary from cash back incentives to low interest rate financing 
new vehicle revenues are also dependent on manufacturers providing adequate vehicle allocations to our dealerships to meet customer demands and the availability of consumer credit 
the automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
as an automotive retailer  we seek to mitigate the effects of this cyclicality by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
for the year ended december   of our total new vehicle revenue was generated by mid line import and luxury dealerships  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively

excluding fleet volume  our retail new vehicle volume growth increased during the year ended december  our new unit volume increase for the year ended december  was led by our honda and toyota scion dealerships  which combined to account for of the year over year increase 
our major japanese brands honda  toyota scion and lexus suffered in the year ended december  as a result of inventory supply reductions caused by the impact of the earthquake  tsunami and severe flooding that struck japan in march as production returned to normal levels in  we saw these brands make significant contributions to our new unit sales growth 
gross profit per new unit decreased during the year ended december   primarily due to declines in gross profit per new unit at our honda and toyota scion dealerships 
our honda and toyota scion dealerships experienced high gross profit per unit during the year ended december  due to lack of available inventory as a result of the natural disasters in japan during as new vehicle inventory in these brands returned to normal levels in early  gross profit per unit also returned to normal levels  resulting in the decrease in our gross profit per new unit during the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
total gross profit dollars increased during the year ended december   in spite of the decline in gross profit per new unit  as a result of increased new unit sales volume

table of contents year ended december  better worse change change in thousands  except units and per unit data revenue gross profit unit sales revenue per unit gross profit per unit gross profit as a of revenue bps for the years ended december  and  our used vehicle unit volume increased compared to the respective prior years  primarily due to the continued implementation of our standardized used vehicle merchandising process 
we believe this process allows us to purchase and price our used vehicles more competitively and market them more effectively than our competition  resulting in higher unit sales volume  overall revenue and overall gross profit levels 
although we experienced declines in our gross profit per unit in the years ended december  and  the incremental unit sales volume contributed to higher gross profit experienced in our f i and parts  service and collision repair fixed operations areas 
the decrease in gross profit per unit for the years ended december  and  were due in part to the higher cost of units sold compared to the prior year and our continued effort to drive used volume at our dealerships by pricing our vehicles effectively 
costs were higher as a result of acquiring more used vehicle inventory through auctions than through trades and increased competition for obtaining quality used vehicle inventory in the second half of due in part to new vehicle inventory shortages as a result of the natural disasters in asia 
despite lower overall gross profit per unit  we believe we were able to drive overall gross profit dollars higher through additional used volume  f i product sales and the effects of higher volume on our fixed operations through reconditioning activity 
wholesale vehicles wholesale vehicle revenues are highly correlated with new and used vehicle retail sales and the associated trade in volume 
wholesale revenues are also significantly affected by our corporate inventory management policies  which are designed to optimize our total used vehicle inventory

table of contents for the years ended december  and  there was an increase in wholesale revenue and wholesale unit sales  as well as a decrease in wholesale gross loss per unit  compared to the respective prior years 
wholesale gross loss increased primarily as a result of the increased unit sales  which increased as a result of significant increases in new and used retail vehicle unit volumes 
these higher retail volumes generate additional trade in vehicle volume that we are not always able to sell as retail used vehicles and choose to sell at auction 
wholesale gross loss at this level is acceptable to us as a necessary result of higher new and used retail volume  which drives additional gross profit in excess of these wholesale losses

parts  service and collision repair fixed operations parts and service revenue consists of customer requested repairs customer pay  warranty repairs  retail parts  wholesale parts and collision repairs 
parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs  available service capacity  vehicle quality  customer loyalty and manufacturer warranty programs 
we believe that over time  vehicle quality will improve  but vehicle complexity and the associated demand for repairs at franchised dealerships will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality 
we also believe that over the long term we have the ability to continue to add service capacity and increase revenues 
however  based on current market conditions  we do not anticipate a near term increase in additional service capacity 
manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty coverage 
these factors  over the long term  combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on certified pre owned cpo vehicles  should facilitate long term growth in our service and parts business 
barriers to long term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty work performed  as well as the improved quality of vehicles that may affect the level and frequency of future warranty related revenues

finance  insurance and other f i finance  insurance and other revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance  sales of third party extended service contracts for vehicles and other aftermarket products 
in connection with vehicle financing  service contracts  other aftermarket products and insurance contracts  we receive commissions from the providers for originating contracts 

table of contents rate spread is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers 
the amount of the commission could be zero  a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the direct financing source bank  credit union or manufacturers captive finance company 
we have established caps on the potential rate spread our dealerships can earn with all finance sources 
we believe the rate spread we earn for arranging financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways  including the following lower cost  below market financing is often available only from the manufacturers captives and franchised dealers  generally easy access to multiple high quality lending sources  lease financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers captives or other indirect lenders  customers with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub prime financing  and customers with significant negative equity in their current vehicle ie  the customer s current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealer 
f i revenues are driven by the level of new and used vehicle unit sales  manufacturer financing or leasing incentives and our f i penetration rate 
the f i penetration rate represents the number of finance contracts  extended service contracts  other aftermarket products or insurance contracts that we are able to originate per vehicle sold  expressed as a percentage

our extended service contract penetration rates increased basis points  to  for the year ended december  further  the aftermarket products penetration rate increased basis points  to  for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  meaning that we sold more than one aftermarket product per vehicle  on average  in both years

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses are comprised of four major groups compensation expense  advertising expense  rent and rent related expense and other expense 
compensation expense primarily relates to dealership personnel who are paid a commission or a modest salary plus commission and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary 
commissions paid to dealership personnel typically vary depending on gross profits realized 
due to the salary component for certain dealership and corporate personnel  gross profits and compensation expense do not change in direct proportion to one another 
advertising expense and other expenses vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and number of dealerships owned 
rent and rent related expense typically varies with the number of dealerships owned  investments made for facility improvements and interest rates 
although not completely correlated  we believe the best way to measure sg a expenses are as a percentage of gross profit

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund debt service  operating lease obligations  working capital requirements  facility improvements and other capital improvements  dividends on our common stock and to finance acquisitions and otherwise invest in our business 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit and floor plan borrowing arrangements  real estate mortgage financing  asset sales and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
we closely monitor our available liquidity and projected future operating results in order to remain in compliance with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities and other debt obligations and lease arrangements 
however  our liquidity could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our existing debt or lease arrangements 
cash flows provided by our dealerships are derived from various sources 
the primary sources include individual consumers  automobile manufacturers  automobile manufacturers captive finance subsidiaries and finance companies 
disruptions in these cash flows can have a material and adverse impact on our operations and overall liquidity 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service our obligations depends to a substantial degree on the cash generated from the operations of these dealership subsidiaries

table of contents arrangements from one finance source to another may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity  working capital or cash flow 
net cash provided by combined trade and non trade floor plan financing was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accordingly  if all changes in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity  the result would have been net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the shift between trade floor plan and non trade floor plan during the year ended december  was primarily due to the realignment in floor plan providers under the then existing credit facilities

during the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repurchases of debt securities and net repayments on notes payable floor plan non trade  offset partially by proceeds from new borrowings  net of debt issuance costs

guarantees and indemnification obligations see discussion under heading off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and indemnification obligations below 
future liquidity outlook our future contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total in thousands floor plan facilities long term debt letters of credit estimated interest payments on floor plan facilities estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases net of sublease rentals construction contracts other purchase obligations fin liability total long term debt amounts consist only of principal obligations 
floor plan facilities balances are correlated with the amount of vehicle inventory and are generally due at the time that a vehicle is sold 
estimated interest payments were calculated using the december  floor plan facilities balance  the weighted average interest rate for the fourth quarter ended december  of and the assumption that floor plan facilities balances at december  would be relieved within days in connection with the sale of the associated vehicle inventory 
estimated interest payments include payments related to interest rate swaps 
other purchase obligations include contracts for real estate purchases  office supplies  utilities and various other items or services

see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe our best source of liquidity for operations and debt service remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities or any replacements thereof  our credit facilities  real estate mortgage financing  selected dealership and other asset sales and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets through offerings of debt or equity securities 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flows and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash 

table of contents seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first quarter normally contributes less operating profit than the second  third and fourth quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality and may adversely affect vehicle demand  and consequently  our profitability 
comparatively  parts and service demand remains stable throughout the year 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and indemnification obligations in connection with the operation and disposition of our dealerships  we have entered into various guarantees and indemnification obligations 
when we sell dealerships  we attempt to assign any related lease to the buyer of the dealership to eliminate any future liability 
however  if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer  we will attempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases 
in the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms at least equal to our lease  we may be required to record lease exit accruals 
as of december   our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased to buyers of sold dealerships totaled approximately million 
future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were approximately million at december  in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealerships  we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising subsequent to the date of sale  including environmental exposure and exposure resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreement 
while our exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs is difficult to quantify  our maximum exposure associated with these general indemnifications was approximately million at december  these indemnifications expire within a period of one to two years following the date of sale 
the estimated fair value of these indemnifications was not material and the amount recorded for this contingency was not significant at december  we expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to increase as we dispose of additional dealerships 
although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters  these guarantees and indemnification obligations  including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sub lessees  cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnification obligations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate floor plan facilities  revolving credit facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in the year ended december  and approximately million in the year ended december  of the total change in interest expense  approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  would have resulted from the floor plan facilities 
in addition to our variable rate debt  as of december  and approximately of our dealership lease facilities have monthly lease payments that fluctuate based on libor interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would not have had a significant impact on rent expense in the year ended december  due to the leases containing libor floors which were above the libor rate during the year ended december  
table of contents we also have various cash flow swaps to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under the terms of these cash flow swaps  interest rates reset monthly 
the fair value of these swap positions at december  was a liability of approximately million  with million included in other accrued liabilities and million recorded to other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these swap positions at december  was a liability of approximately million  with million included in other accrued liabilities and million included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we will receive and pay interest based on the following notional amount pay rate receive rate maturing date in millions one month libor july  one month libor december  one month libor august  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor september  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor july  one month libor june  one month libor june  the one month libor rate was at december  changes in fair value are recorded through earnings 
the effective date of these forward starting swaps is july  during the year ended december   we entered into two million notional amount forward starting interest rate swap agreements which became effective in july and terminate in july during the year ended december   we entered into four million notional amount forward starting interest rate swap agreements which became effective in july and terminate between july and july during the year ended december   we entered into two million notional amount forward starting interest rate swap agreements which will become effective in july and terminate in june these interest rate swaps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and  as a result  changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of related income taxes  in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 

table of contents absent the acceleration of payments of principal that may result from non compliance with financial and operational covenants under our various indebtedness  future principal maturities of variable and fixed rate debt and related interest rate swaps are as follows thereafter total fair value in thousands long term debt fixed rate maturities fixed rate outstanding average rate on fixed outstanding debt variable rate maturities variable rate outstanding average rate on variable outstanding debt cash flow interest rate swaps variable to fixed maturities variable to fixed outstanding average pay rate on outstanding swaps based on amounts outstanding at december of each respective period 
foreign currency risk we purchase certain of our new vehicle and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers 
although we purchase our inventories in us dollars  our business is subject to foreign exchange rate risk that may influence automobile manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the united states 
to the extent that we cannot recapture this volatility in prices charged to customers or if this volatility negatively impacts consumer demand for our products  this volatility could adversely affect our future operating results
