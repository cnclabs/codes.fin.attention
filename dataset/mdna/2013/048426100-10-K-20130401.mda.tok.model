item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general description of business the principal business of atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in held for sale loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences originated through our warehouse lending customers  and  to a lesser extent  first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences  home equity loans and automobile and other consumer loans originated for retention in our loan portfolio 
in addition we have been increasing our focus on small business lending through our sba lending programs  as well as commercial business and owner occupied commercial real estate loans to small businesses 
loans are obtained principally through retail staff and  brokers 
the company sells the guaranteed portion of loans originated through small business lending  rather than hold the loans in portfolio 
we also originate multi family residential loans and commercial construction and residential construction loans  but no longer emphasize the origination of such loans unless they are connected with sba lending 
we also invest in investment securities  primarily those issued by us government sponsored agencies or entities  including fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae 
revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest earning assets  such as investment securities 
to a lesser extent  revenue is generated from service charges  gains on the sale of loans and other income 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms  which generally include savings accounts  money market accounts  demand deposit accounts and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from days to five years 
in accordance with the consent order see recent events interest rates paid on deposit are limited and subject to national rates published weekly by the fdic 
deposits are primarily solicited in the bank s market area of southeastern georgia and the jacksonville metropolitan area when necessary to fund loan demand 
recent events on february   the company and the bank entered into an agreement and plan of merger with bond street holdings  inc and its bank subsidiary  florida community bank  na pursuant to the merger agreement  the company will be merged with and into bond street and the bank will then merge with and into florida community bank 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of the company s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be converted into the right to receive in cash 
of this amount  i per share in cash will be payable to shareholders following the closing of the merger  ii per share in cash will be held in an escrow account and will be available to cover losses from shareholder claims  net of payments received under insurance policies covering such losses  for one year following the closing of the merger or until the final resolution of such claims  if later 
any remaining cash will be payable to shareholders of the company 
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are subject to the approval of the shareholders of the company  regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
closing of the merger is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of effective august   the bank board of directors consented to the issuance of the order by the occ 
among other things  the order calls for the bank to achieve and maintain tier capital of of adjusted total assets and total risk based capital of of risk weighted assets by december  the bank was not incompliance with the order at december  with respect to the capital requirements 
as of that date  tier leverage ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were   and  respectively 
as a result of entering into the order to achieve and maintain specific capital levels  the bank s capital classification under the pca rules has been lowered to adequately capitalized 
the company board of directors and management remain committed to meeting the capital requirements of the order at the earliest possible time through the completion of the merger described above  or if not approved  then through continuation of its strategic alternatives process 
the order does not affect the bank ability to continue to conduct its banking business with customers in a normal fashion 
see part i 
item business supervision and regulation contained in this report for further description of the provisions contained in the order 
the company is regulated by the frb and remains under the provisions of the ots supervisory agreement dated december  critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  determining fair value of securities available for sale  other real estate owned and accounting for deferred income taxes 
these accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
generally  loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibity of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
due to the decline in real estate values in our markets since and the weak united states economy in general  we believe it is likely that collateral for non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans  will not be sufficient to fully repay such loans 
therefore the company charges one to four family residential and home equity loans down by the expected loss amount at the time they become non performing  which is generally days past due 
this process accelerates the recognition of charge offs on one to four family residential and home equity loans but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process 
the reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management  within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines  based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas 
senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted monthly with the bank s senior management and board of directors 
management s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include a general loss component for unimpaired loans by type of loan and specific allowances for identified impaired loans 
the general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors  adjusted for other qualitative factors to outstanding unimpaired loan balances 
loss factors are based on the bank s recent loss experience 
qualitative factors consider current market conditions that may impact real estate values within the bank s primary lending areas  and on other significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
other significant qualitative factors that exist as of the balance sheet date that are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include the following current delinquency levels and trends  non performing asset levels and trends and related charge off history  economic trends local and national  changes in loan policy  expertise of management and staff of the bank  volumes and terms of loans  and concentrations of credit 
the impact of the general loss component on the allowance began increasing during and has remained at an elevated level through the end of the increase reflected the deterioration of market conditions since  and the increase in the recent loan loss experience that has resulted from management s proactive approach to charging off losses on impaired one to four family and home equity loans in the period the impairment is identified 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change and risks 
for all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement  impairment is determined by computing a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
no specific allowance is recorded unless fair value is less than carrying value 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation  for these loans  the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the general allowance for loan losses policy described above 
accordingly  individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures  unless the loan has been modified as a troubled debt restructuring as discussed below 
loans for which the terms have been modified as a result of the borrower s financial difficulties are classified as tdrs 
tdrs are measured for impairment based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s interest rate at inception of the loan or the appraised value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impairment of homogeneous loans  such as one to four family residential loans  that have been modified as tdrs is calculated in the aggregate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
loans modified as tdrs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired loans in the year of restructure and until the loan has performed for months in accordance with the modified terms 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  and million  or of total loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses for each quarter of  and  and the total for the respective years is as follows dollars in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total provision for loan losses as this information illustrates the amount of the allowance for loan losses and related provision expense can vary over long term and short term periods 
changes in economic conditions  the composition of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact the required level of allowance for loan losses  particularly for larger individually evaluated loan relationships  in relatively short periods of time 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to individually evaluated loan relationships was million and million at december  and  respectively  a decrease of million 
given the rapidly changing and uncertain real estate market coupled with changes in borrowers financial condition  changes in collateral values  and the overall economic uncertainty  management anticipates there will continue to be significant changes in individual specific loss allocations in future periods as these factors are difficult to predict and can vary widely as more information becomes available or as projected events change 
fair value of securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices  if available level 
for securities where quoted prices are not available  fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities level 
for securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available  fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators level 
management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
in determining otti  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the determination date 
when otti is determined to have occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings 
the amount of the otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the company recorded no otti for the year ended december  other real estate owned assets acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
if fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through expense 
costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized  whereas costs relating to the holding of property are expensed 
deferred income taxes after converting to a federally chartered savings association  atlantic coast bank became a taxable organization 
income tax expense  or benefit  is the total of the current year income tax due  or refundable  and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates and operating loss carryforwards 
the company s principal deferred tax assets result from the allowance for loan losses and operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
since atlantic coast bank s transition to a federally chartered savings bank  the company has recorded income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by the company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review by taxing authorities of the positions taken by management could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered when determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the carrying amount to a balance that is considered more likely than not to be realized 
the determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of such evidence 
positive evidence considered includes the probability of achieving forecasted taxable income and the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition 
negative evidence includes the company s cumulative losses 
following the initial establishment of a valuation allowance  if the company is unable to generate sufficient pre tax income in future periods or otherwise fails to meet forecasted operating results  an additional valuation allowance may be required 
any valuation allowance is required to be recorded during the period identified 
as of december   the company had a valuation allowance of million for the net deferred tax asset 
business strategy overview our primary objective is to operate a community oriented financial institution  serving customers in our primary market areas while providing stockholders a solid long term return on capital 
accomplishing this objective will require financial strength based on a strong capital position  and the implementation of business strategies designed to return the company to profitability consistent with safety and soundness considerations 
to strengthen the company s capital position the company has entered into the merger agreement discussed above 
in the event the merger is not approved or completed  the company will continue to explore all strategic alternatives to raise capital 
operating strategies are focused on credit management and reducing the cost of non performing assets  increasing revenues from mortgage banking  principally through the bank s warehouse lending activity  and small business lending activities that maximize profits but with lower capital requirements 
in addition  the company seeks to increase non maturity deposits to improve our cost of funds and to reduce our cost structure 
as stated in the consent order  before the bank can make significant changes to its current products  services  asset composition and size  funding sources  and other business activities it must get non objection from the occ unless it has been given written non objection to its strategic and capital plan 
see part i 
item business supervision and regulation contained in this report for further description of the provisions contained in the order 
the following are the key elements of our business strategy strengthening our capital position 
following the company s conversion from a mutual holding company to a stock company  the company s board of directors began considering strategies to raise capital 
in late  the company began a review of strategic alternatives  engaging stifel  nicolaus and company  incorporated to assist the board in exploring alternatives to enhance stockholder value  including various alternatives including a recapitalization in the form of a rights offering as well as an outright merger transaction 
in evaluating its options  the board of directors considered the relative risks involved with the alternatives  along with the company goal of maximizing the return to stockholders 
these risks include the prospects of approval by regulators for successful completion of each alternative  the effectiveness of each option in gaining full compliance with the order issued by the occ under which the bank operates  the bank continued exposure to credit  market  economic  and interest rate risks  as well as ongoing earnings pressure from the company asset quality and wholesale debt 
considering all the factors the board of directors entered into the merger agreement on february  completion of the merger  which is subject to approval by our regulators and stockholders  is expected to close by june  in the event the merger is not completed the board of directors will continue to explore all other strategic alternatives to raise capital 
there can be no assurances that the company will complete the merger  or if necessary  otherwise raise additional capital 
continuing our proactive approach to reducing non performing assets by aggressive resolution and disposition initiatives 
as a result of the decline in our local economy beginning in  the bank experienced a substantial increase in our non performing assets 
at december   our non performing assets were million as compared to million at december  management has instituted a proactive strategy to aggressively reduce non performing assets through accelerated charge offs  loan work out programs  enhanced collection practices  the use of distressed asset sales and improved risk management 
an aggressive charge off policy 
beginning in  management began to implement an aggressive charge off strategy for one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans by taking partial or full charge offs in the period that such loans became non accruing  generally when loans are days or more past due 
loan work out programs 
we remain committed to working with responsible borrowers to renegotiate residential loan terms 
the bank had million in troubled debt restructurings at december   compared to million at december  troubled debt restructurings avoid the expense of foreclosure proceedings and holding and disposition expenses of selling foreclosed property  and provide us increased interest income 
enhanced collection practices 
beginning in  due to the elevated delinquency of our one to four family residential mortgage loans and the increasing complexity of working out these types of loans  management engaged the services of a national third party servicer for certain loans 
initially  one to four family residential mortgage loans  and any associated home equity loans that were days past due  were assigned to the third party servicer for collection 
subsequently  the bank assigned other one to four family residential mortgage loans to the third party servicer irrespective of delinquency status  if it was determined the loan may have higher than normal collection risk 
at december   the outstanding balance of loans assigned to the third party servicer was million 
in addition in  the company increased resources internally to focus on workouts of non performing one to four family residential loans which has led to decreased levels of non performing loans and improved recoveries 
non performing asset sales 
in order to reduce the expenses of the foreclosure process  including the sale of foreclosed property  the bank has sold certain non performing loans through national loan sales of distressed assets  which may mitigate future losses 
from to december   the bank sold million of loans through distressed asset sales resulting in a loss on such sales of million 
the bank may continue distressed asset sales in the future to dispose of non performing assets when management believes it will result in the least overall loss to the company 
also as a part of the bank s work out program the bank continues to accept short sales of residential property by borrowers where such properties are sold at a loss and the proceeds of such sales are paid to us when this action represents the least costly resolution for the company 
credit risk management 
the bank is also enhancing credit administration by improving internal risk management processes 
in  an independent risk committee of our board of directors was established to evaluate and monitor system  market and credit risk 
in  in connection with a requirement by the order  the bank established a broad problem asset resolution program and developed enhanced asset workout plans for each criticized asset 
increasing revenue by expanding our warehouse lending operations and increasing our emphasis on commercial lending to small businesses 
historically  atlantic coast bank has emphasized the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in northeastern florida and southeastern georgia 
at december   our one to four family residential loan portfolio was million  or  of our loan portfolio 
during late  the bank began to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market on a limited scale 
as a result of our internal evaluation  management has begun to shift our business model to a process where customers requesting a mortgage loan will be referred to a third party in exchange for a fee for closed mortgages and sell such mortgages purchased through warehouse lending arrangements 
in addition  the bank intends to continue to increase production in its small business lending initiative 
warehouse lending strategy 
in the latter part of  the bank began a program for warehouse lending where we finance mortgages originated by third parties and hold a lien position for a short duration usually less than days while earning interest and often a fee until a sale is completed to an investor 
management expects to modestly expand this aspect of mortgage banking in the future 
commercial lending strategy 
management also plans to increase commercial business lending and owner occupied commercial real estate lending with an emphasis on small businesses  subject to regulatory capital requirements 
the bank intends to participate in government programs relating to commercial business loans such as the sba and the us department of agriculture usda 
the bank began to implement this strategy in september  by hiring an executive to lead the small business lending along with an experienced sba lending team 
the sba loan pipeline grew from million at the beginning of to million at december  the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of sba loans to investors at attractive premiums 
our focus on owner occupied commercial real estate loans will be to professional service businesses 
the bank intends to target principal balances of up to million in our commercial business and owner occupied commercial real estate lending  while not originating or purchasing higher risk loans such as commercial real estate development projects  multi family loans and land acquisition and development loans 
strengthening our retail franchise by growing noninterest bearing deposits and reducing our overall cost of deposits 
we believe a successful retail franchise results from a strong core customer base that a focuses on noninterest bearing deposits within an overall deposit strategy that offers interest rates that are competitive to its markets  but in line with the overall interest rate environment 
therefore  we remain committed to generating lower cost and more stable noninterest bearing deposits and offering our customers other deposit products with interest rates that are fair and meet their financial needs 
the bank compliments its attractive deposit products with excellent customer service and a comprehensive marketing program 
the bank continues to build a core customer base by offering noninterest bearing and other non maturity deposits to individuals  businesses and municipalities located in our market area 
our noninterest bearing deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  at december   noninterest bearing deposits comprised of our total deposits  compared to of our total deposits at december  total cost of deposits interest expense on deposits as compared to total average deposits for the full year of was as compared to for in addition to improving our interest rate spread noninterest bearing deposits also contributes noninterest income from account related services 
reducing our operating expense base 
the company has historically operated with a high cost structure as it has implemented growth and new business activities 
in order to improve profitability in  we implemented numerous expense reduction initiatives in order to reduce operating costs that do not add value to our other business strategies 
we intend to continue this focus in order to eliminate non value added expenses and activities 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general total assets decreased million  or  to million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary reason for the decrease in assets was a decrease in loans of million  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and an increase in securities available for sale of million as the company continued to manage its balance sheet consistent with its capital preservation strategy and to increase the company s liquidity position 
total deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  noninterest bearing demand and time deposits grew by a total of million while interest bearing demand accounts and savings and money market accounts decreased by million during the year ended december  stockholders equity decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  due to the net loss of million for the year ended december   partially offset by an increase in other comprehensive income of million for the same time period

the unguaranteed portion of sba loans at december  and was million and  respectively 
the company plans to continue to expand this business line going forward 
until there is greater certainty about the economic recovery and the bank increases its capital levels  management believes portfolio loan balances will continue to decline 
principal amortization and loan payoffs are expected to exceed growth in the sba portfolio and other small business loan production 
however  due to the favorable interest rate environment  production of one to four family residential mortgages originated by third parties warehouse is expected to grow modestly 
the composition of the bank s loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward one to four family residential mortgage loans 
as of december   first mortgages including residential construction loans  second mortgages and home equity loans totaled million  or of total gross loans 
approximately million  or of loans recorded as home equity loans are in a first lien position 
accordingly  million  or of loans collateralized by one to four family residential loans were in a first lien position as of december  the composition of the bank s loan portfolio by state as of december  was as follows florida georgia other states total dollars in thousands one to four family first mortgages   one to four family second mortgages   one to four family construction loans allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december  compared to million or of total loans at december  the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended december  and was as follows december  december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year   charge offs real estate loans one to four family   commercial   other land and multi family  real estate construction loans one to four family commercial  acquisition and development other loans home equity   consumer   commercial  total charge offs   recoveries real estate loans one to four family  commercial other land and multi family real estate construction loans one to four family commercial acquisition and development other loans home equity consumer commercial total recoveries  net charge offs   provision for loan losses   balance at end of year   net charge offs during increased compared to primarily due to increased sales and short sales of non performing loans 
during the year ended december   the bank sold  or entered into contracts to sell  million of non performing loans 
these transactions have resulted in total charge offs of million and additional provision for loan losses of million during the same time period 
the net charge offs on sales and short sales of non performing loans during the year ended december  was comprised of million for the distressed sale of one to four family residential loans  million for non residential commercial real estate loans and million for other small balance short sales 
the company seeks to reduce non performing loans in the least costly way possible  including workout  troubled debt restructurings  short sales and when necessary foreclosure and disposal of collateral 
loans the company holds for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value on an aggregate basis and reported as held for sale 
as of december   the company had no non performing loans held for sale 
in addition to increased charge offs due to sales and short sales of non performing loans  net charge offs during also increased compared to due to a million charge off of residential land loans  million for a participation in a non performing construction loan  million for increased consumer loan charge offs  million for the charge off of collateral dependent land loans  the impairment for which had been reserved for in  and million for the charge off of an owner occupied commercial real estate loan  which had been reserved for in it is the company s policy to charge off one to four family first mortgages and home equity loans to the estimated fair value of the collateral at the time the loan becomes non performing 
during the year ended december   charge offs include partial charge offs of million of one to four family first mortgages and home equity loans identified as non performing  a decrease of million as compared to million for the prior year  principally attributable to reduced losses on one to four family residential mortgages

during the market for disposing of non performing assets became more liquid leading to the sales described above 
these types of transactions may result in additional losses over the amounts provided for in the allowance for loan losses however the company continues to attempt to reduce non performing assets through the least costly means possible 
the allowance for loan losses is determined by the information available at the time such determination is made and reflects management s best estimate of loss 
as of december   total non performing one to four family residential and home equity loans of million was comprised of million in contractual balances that had been written down to the estimated fair value of their collateral at the date that the loan was classified as non performing 
further declines in the fair value of the collateral  or a decision to sell such loans as distressed assets  could result in additional losses 
as of december   and december   all non performing loans were classified as non accrual  and there were no loans days past due and accruing interest as of december  and oreo increased million to million at december  from million at december  as transfers from non performing loans into oreo of million exceeded foreclosed asset sales of million during at december  the five largest non performing loans were as follows

the decline in non performing impaired loans was primarily due to the transfer of million in loans to other real estate owned  short sales of million in commercial real estate loans and charge downs of million on loans which remain as non performing impaired loans or other real estate owned at december  impaired loans include large non homogeneous loans where it is probable that the bank will not receive all principal and interest when contractually due 
impaired loans also include tdrs where the borrower has performed for less than months under the terms of the modification and or the tdr loan is at less than market rate at the time of restructure 
when a tdr loan with a market rate of interest has performed for over months under terms of the modification it is classified as a performing loan 
tdr loans totaled million as of december  as compared to million at december  approximately million of restructured loans demonstrated months of performance under restructured terms and therefore are reported as performing or were paid off 
deferred income taxes as of both december  and the company concluded that  while improved operating results are expected as the economy begins to improve and the bank s non performing assets decline  the variability of the credit related costs are such that a more likely than not conclusion of realization of the company s deferred tax asset could not be supported 
consequently the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million for nearly the entire amount of the net federal and state deferred tax assets as of december  until such time as the company determines it is more likely than not that it is able to generate taxable income  no tax benefits will be recorded in future periods to reduce net losses before taxes 
however  at such time in the future that the company records taxable income or determines that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  some or all of the valuation allowance may be available as a tax benefit 
deposits total deposits were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  non maturing deposits decreased by million during  while time deposits increased by million during the same time period 
non maturing deposits decreased to million at december  primarily due to a million decrease in money market deposits  partially offset by increases in noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits as the bank focused sales and marketing efforts on increasing noninterest bearing deposit customers 
time deposits increased to million as of december  due to an increase of million in deposits acquired through a national internet deposit program  partially offset by decreased retail and broker declines of million 
as a part of its capital preservation strategy  the bank strategically lowered rates on time deposits beginning in the second half of in order to reduce those deposits consistent with loan balance decreases 
management believes near term deposit growth will be moderate with an emphasis on core deposits to match asset growth expectations 
dramatic changes in the short term interest rate environment could affect the availability of deposits in our local market and therefore cause the bank to change its strategy to promote time deposit growth in order to meet liquidity needs 
under atlantic coast bank s consent order with the occ dated august   the bank may not renew or increase brokered deposits without prior written non objection from the occ 
at december  the bank had brokered deposits of million 
the prohibition not to renew or increase brokered deposits also prevents the bank from offering deposit rates higher than basis points over the fdic published national average rate for comparable deposit types 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase the company has securities sold under agreements to repurchase with a carrying amount of million as of december  and collateral for the structured notes are subject to a haircut of after applying values set by the counterparties 
under the terms of the agreements the counterparties require that the company provide additional collateral for the borrowings as protection for their market risk when the fair value of the borrowings exceeds the contractual amounts 
as a result  the company had million and million in securities posted as collateral for these instruments as of december  and  respectively 
the company will be required to post additional collateral if the gap between the market value of the liability and the contractual amount of the liability increases 
information concerning securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of december  and is summarized as follows december  december  dollars in thousands average daily balance   weighted average coupon interest rate during the period maximum month end balance during the period   weighted average coupon interest rate at end of period weighted average maturity months beginning in january  the lender has the option to terminate individual advances in whole the following quarter  there is no termination penalty if terminated by the lender 
there have been no early terminations 
prior to august   the agreement with the counterparty on million of the million contained default provisions related to the bank s pca capital levels and enforcement actions that the bank may be subject to with its primary banking regulator 
specifically  in the event the bank s capital ratios fell below adequately capitalized  or if the bank received a cease and desist order from its primary banking regulator  the counterparty had the option to call the debt at its fair value 
at december   the fair value of that portion of the debt exceeded the carrying value by approximately million 
on august   the company entered into a revised agreement with the counterparty which eliminated the event of default which gave the counterparty the option to terminate the reverse repurchase agreements at the market value of the debt in the event the bank becomes less than adequately capitalized or receives a cease and desist order from the occ 
under the terms of the revised agreement  the bank will be required to pledge additional collateral if its capital ratios decrease below regulatory defined levels of well capitalized or adequately capitalized 
federal home loan bank advances fhlb borrowings were million at december  and the fhlb advances had a weighted average maturity of months and a weighted average rate of at december  the bank s borrowing capacity with the fhlb has decreased from million at december  to million at december  in part this decrease was due to the declining balance of outstanding loans used as collateral as a result of normal loan payments and payoffs 
in addition  due to the bank s financial condition the fhlb has increased the amount of discount applied to determine the collateral value of the loans 
the bank intends to supplement its loan collateral with investment securities as needed to secure the fhlb borrowings or pre pay advances to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure the debt 
unpledged securities available for collateral amounted to million as of december  in the event the bank pre pays an advance prior to maturity  it must do so at its fair value  which as of december  exceeded the book value of the individual advances by million 
to the extent it is required to purchase additional securities to collateralize the fhlb debt  the company s profitability may decrease as liquidity may not be available for higher earning asset growth 
during the third quarter of  the fhlb notified the bank that it was required to collateralize the excess of the fair value of the fhlb advances over the book value 
as of december  the amount of the collateral pledged for the excess of fair value over the book value totaled million of cash and million of investment securities 
stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  due to the net loss of million for the year ended december   partially offset by other comprehensive income of million 
beginning in and continuing into  the company implemented strategies to preserve capital including the suspension of cash dividends and its stock repurchase program 
resumption of these programs is not expected to occur in the near term 
the company s equity to assets ratio decreased to at december   from at december  as of december   the bank s tier capital to adjusted assets ratio was  total risk based capital to risk weighted assets was and tier capital to risk weighted assets was 
due to the consent order requiring that the bank meet and maintain a tier capital to adjusted assets ratio of and a total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of by december  the bank is deemed as adequately capitalized for regulatory supervision purposes 
these ratios as of december  were   and  respectively 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general net loss for the year ended december  was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net loss for declined compared with due to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of million and a decrease in noninterest expense of million  primarily related to a reduction in compensation and benefits  partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of million  due to lower average balances of interest earning assets as well as lower average yields  and a decrease in noninterest income of million  primarily due to lower gains on the sale of securities available for sale

interest income on loans decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease was due to a decline in the average balance of loans  which decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  combined with a slight decrease in average yield on loans of basis points to for the year ended december  interest income earned on securities decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease was due to the lower interest rates available on new purchases of securities and higher premium amortization due to increased prepayments 
the impact of the decline in yield by basis points to was partially offset by an increase in the average balance of securities of million to million for the year ended december  due to the decline in yield as a result of the low interest rate environment  the decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets and the change in the mix of interest earning assets related to our capital preservation strategy  the company expects interest income to be lower during as compared to interest expense interest expense declined by million to million for the year ended december  from million in primarily due to the decrease in interest expense on deposits

the bank s overall cost of funds  including noninterest bearing deposits  was for the year ended december  down from for  primarily due to lower cost of deposits 
the bank s cost of funds is elevated relative to the current interest rate environment due to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
net interest income net interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to the decrease in interest income resulting from a reduction in average outstanding interest earning assets and lower average yields earned on those assets partially offset by decreased interest expense on deposits

liquidity management maintains a liquidity position it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
atlantic coast financial corporation relies on a number of different sources in order to meet its potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources of funds are increases in deposit accounts  cash flows from loan payments and securities sales and borrowings 
the scheduled amortization of loans and securities as well as proceeds from borrowings  are predictable sources of funds 
in addition loans held for sale  principally warehouse loans  repay rapidly with an average duration of less than days  with repayments generally funding advances 
other funding sources  however  such as inflows from new deposits  mortgage and investment securities prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
while primary sources of funds continue to be adequate to meet demands  management has limited contingent liquidity sources available to meet potential funding requirements and therefore has increased the amount of cash and cash equivalents held during as of december  and  the company had additional borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively  with the fhlb of atlanta 
during the company s borrowing capacity was reduced following an fhlb of atlanta credit and collateral review 
during the bank was notified by the frb that it is no longer eligible to borrow under the primary credit program and that it no longer has daylight overdraft capacity available  although the bank has not participated in these programs in the past 
unpledged marketable investment securities were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company also utilizes a non brokered direct deposit certificate of deposit listing service to meet funding needs at interest rates equal to or less than local market rates 
during  the bank has increased deposits from this service by million and expects it will continue to do so as a supplement to retail deposit production 
threats to the bank s liquidity position include rapid declines in deposit balances due to market volatility caused by major changes in interest rates or negative public perception about the bank  or the financial services industry in general 
in addition the amount of investment securities that would otherwise be available to meet liquidity needs is limited due to the collateral requirements of our long term debt 
specifically  the bank s securities sold under agreements to repurchase which total million have collateral requirements in excess of the debt and the collateral requirements of the fhlb debt are supplemented with investment securities collateral 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  as part of the bank s strategy to strengthen its overall liquidity position 
cash from investing activities of million was more than cash used in operating activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million 
primary sources of cash were from sales of loans held for sale of million  proceeds from maturities and payments of securities available for sale of million  proceeds from sales of securities available for sale of million  net decreases in loans of million and proceeds from the sale of oreo of million 
primary uses of cash included loans originated for sale of million and purchases of securities available for sale of million 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december   to million as of december  cash from investing activities of million was more than cash used for operating activities of million and cash used for financing activities of million

during the company s board of directors declared no regular quarterly dividends 
the decision to pay dividends in the future is dependent on operating results  capital and liquidity requirements and is subject to regulatory approval 
as of december  atlantic coast financial corporation held no treasury stock 
the company s predecessor suspended its repurchase program in march initiation of future share repurchase programs is dependent on liquidity  opportunities for alternative investments and capital requirements

the bank was not in compliance with the order at december   with respect to the required capital levels 
as a result of the order to achieve and maintain specific capital levels  the bank s capital classification under the pca rules as of december   was adequately capitalized 
inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets and our profitability  management believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having corresponding effect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the opposite may occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits  re price more rapidly or at different rates than its interest earning assets 
in order to address the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on our results of operations  management has adopted an asset and liability management policy 
the board of directors sets the asset and liability policy for the company  which is implemented by the asset liability committee alco 
the purpose of the alco is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the alco establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk  and profitability goals 
the alco generally meets at least quarterly  but more frequently if needed  to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to market value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
the alco recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the alco also is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly 
a key element of our asset liability plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or re pricing mismatch between its interest earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
historically  the company has sought to reduce exposure to its earnings through the use of adjustable rate loans and through the sale of certain fixed rate loans in the secondary market  and by extending funding maturities through the use of the fhlb advances 
in part  the bank measures its exposure to interest rate risk using an analytical model referred to as net portfolio value npv that estimates the value of the net cash flows of interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
the bank also measures interest rate risk by estimating the impact of interest rate changes on its net interest income which is defined as the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous  and basis point increase or a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  the bank does not consider interest rate decreases of greater than basis points in either of the two models used to measure interest rate risk 
as shown below the company s greatest risk is due to a decline in interest rates  but improves in an upward rate environment 
this is due to the high level of fixed rate debt at interest rates well above market 
the company s exposure to interest risk has increased during due to continued low interest rate environment which magnifies the impact of the cost of the company s long term debt and increased investment in lower rate investment securities along with an overall decline in interest earning assets 
as of december  net present value as a percentage of present value of assets pva net interest income estimated increase decrease in net present value increase decrease in estimated net interest income change in interest rates basis points estimated net present value amount percent net present value ratio increase decrease basis points estimated net interest income amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
net present value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
discount rates are unique to each class of asset and liability and are principally estimated as spreads over wholesale rates 
pva represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
net present value ratio represents net present value divided by pva 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income 
modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
