recently adopted accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required

critical accounting policies during december  the securities and exchange commission sec published a commission statement in the form of financial reporting release no 
which encouraged that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  management believes the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title passes upon shipment of goods to customers 
the company s revenue earning activities involve delivering or producing goods 
the following criteria are met before revenue is recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured

development costs of a computer software product to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features and technical performance requirements are completed 
the company had been developing computer software for its xcelasan storage caching product line 
on november   the company determined that technological feasibility of the product was established  and development costs subsequent to that date have been capitalized 
prior to november   the company expensed all development costs related to this product line 
in the third quarter of fiscal when the product was made available for general release to customers  the company discontinued capitalizing development costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the xcelasan product was available for general release and generated approximately  of revenue  which was significantly lower than expected 
the company capitalized approximately  of xcelasan development cost in fiscal the company capitalized approximately  of xcelasan research and development costs in fiscal the company determined in fiscal s third quarter based on the estimated future net realizable value for the expected periods of benefit that the carrying value of capitalized software development cost was impaired

income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the expenses income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers certain tax planning strategies in its assessment as to the recoverability of its tax assets 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the tax rate changes 
the company recognizes  in its consolidated financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on technical merits of the position 
there are no material unrecognized tax positions in the financial statements 
goodwill based on a combination of factors that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including the operating results of the mmb business unit  management concluded that a goodwill impairment triggering event had occurred 
and accordingly performed a testing of the carrying value of  of goodwill for mmb 
based on a combination of factors that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including the operating results of the mmb business unit  management concluded that a goodwill impairment triggering event had occurred 
accordingly  the company performed a testing of the carrying value of  of goodwill for mmb using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
after this testing  management concluded that the carrying value of the mmb business unit exceeded the fair value of this reporting unit 
the implied fair value of the goodwill of the mmb business unit was calculated by allocating the fair values of substantially all of its individual assets  liabilities and identified intangible assets as if mmb business unit had been acquired in a business combination 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and certain other reserves and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
some of the more significant estimates made by management include the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance and other operating allowances and accruals 
actual results could differ from those estimates
