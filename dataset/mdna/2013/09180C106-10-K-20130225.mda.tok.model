item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of february  we owned and operated restaurants located in states california  texas  florida  arizona  nevada  colorado  ohio  oregon  oklahoma  washington  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana and new mexico 
each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  a bj s pizza grill  or a bj s grill restaurant 
our menu features our bj s award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our hand tossed style pizza  our proprietary craft beers and other beers  as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads  desserts  including our pizookie dessert  non alcoholic beverages  wine and spirits 
the first bj s restaurant was opened in orange county  california in as a small full service restaurant focusing on a lighter  bakery crust style deep dish pizza 
we acquired the original bj s restaurants in from their original owners 
our initial public offering of common stock occurred in additionally  in  we opened our first large format restaurant and brewery in brea  california and began to expand the menu to include our own craft beer  appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
of the restaurants we operated as of february   are bj s restaurant brewery restaurants of which three are currently manufacturing our proprietary craft beer for some of our restaurants  are bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurants which are similar to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture beer  six are bj s pizza grill restaurants which are primarily our original  smaller format legacy restaurants and one is bj s grill a smaller format full service restaurant intended to serve as a live research and development restaurant at the current time 
in the near term  our future restaurant growth will focus principally on our bj s restaurant brewhouse format 
however  we may continue to build additional bj s restaurant brewery locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer 
we may also consider opening the smaller format bj s grill or a smaller format bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurant as fill in locations in certain densely populated  urban trade areas  or in smaller cities  where a larger format location could not be obtained or is not appropriate 
we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize other qualified craft brewers to produce our proprietary craft beers and sodas under our proprietary recipes and our indirect supervision 
we currently believe that  over the long run  it will become more beneficial to increase our contract brewing due to the economies of scale that can be obtained from brewing beer in large quantities while also avoiding potential liquor licensing complications in some states where we desire to operate restaurants 
as such  we expect to continue increasing our contract brewing relationships 
as a result of this expected increase in contract brewing  we intend to rebalance our internal beer production activities on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we may decide to eventually decommission certain additional internally operated breweries  which may result in additional disposals of related assets in the future 
we intend to continue developing and opening new bj s restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve sustained increases in comparable sales in excess of our annual effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants  assuming we are able to retain our guest traffic levels in those restaurants 
therefore  we currently expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth for fiscal will be derived from new restaurant openings and the carryover impact of partial year openings during newly opened restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for several months after their opening in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our more mature  established restaurants 
accordingly  the number and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on restaurant opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and occupancy and operating expenses 
additionally  initial restaurant openings in new markets 
table of contents may experience even greater inefficiencies for several months  if not longer  due to lower initial sales volumes  which results from initially low consumer awareness levels  and a lack of supply chain and other operating cost leverage until additional restaurants can be opened in the markets 
our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurants 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
gift card breakage is recognized as other income on our consolidated statements of income 
gift card breakage is recorded when the likelihood of the redemption of the gift cards becomes remote  which is typically after months from original gift card issuance 
cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs 
the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes 
labor and benefit costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees  including stock based compensation that is directly related to restaurant level team members 
occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies  credit card fees  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
general and administrative costs include all corporate  field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include corporate management  field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related employee benefits including stock based compensation expense and cash based incentive compensation  travel and relocation costs  information systems  the cost to recruit and train new restaurant management employees  corporate rent  certain brand marketing related expenses and legal  professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
restaurant opening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant  travel  the cost of food and supplies used in training  grand opening promotional costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant  including rent during the construction and in restaurant training period 
while we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases  no guarantee can be given that such leases will be renewed or  if renewed  that rents will not increase substantially 
we currently have a lease for one of our restaurants scheduled to expire during the next twelve months 
we believe that the expiring lease can be renewed on satisfactory terms and we are currently communicating with the respective landlord to determine the specific terms of the renewal 
however  there is no guarantee that we can mutually agree to a new lease that is satisfactory to both of us 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
guest traffic for our restaurants is estimated based on values assigned to certain menu items or individual guest tickets 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues 
all fiscal years presented consist of weeks with the exception of fiscal year which consists of weeks 
fiscal year consolidated statements of income data revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor and benefits occupancy and operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization restaurant opening loss on disposal of assets natural disaster and related legal other settlements and terminations total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense gain loss on investment settlement other income  net total other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income weeks ended january  fiscal compared to the weeks ended january  fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately million in sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base  as well as an approximate increase in comparable restaurant sales on a week basis 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an estimated effective menu price increase of approximately coupled with a positive shift in our estimated menu mix  offset by a slight decrease in estimated guest traffic 
our restaurants  like most in casual dining  are impacted by inflationary pressures for the costs of certain commodities  labor and other operating expenses 
we attempt to offset the impact of inflation on our cost structure with purchasing economies of scale  productivity and efficiency improvements  menu merchandising and menu price increases 
if our guests do not accept our menu price increases  either by reducing their visits to our restaurants or by changing their purchasing patterns at our restaurants  the expected benefit of any menu price increase could be negated and our operating margins could be adversely impacted 
additionally  to help protect guest traffic and to respond to the actions of our competitors  we may consider the promotion of selective menu offerings or introduce new menu offerings at reduced or lower price points which could have the effect of further reducing any benefit from menu price increases 
as a relatively small casual dining restaurant chain  we do not have the financial resources to match the marketing and advertising spending levels of our larger casual dining 
table of contents competitors 
accordingly  increased marketing and advertising spending by our larger competitors may also adversely impact general levels of guest traffic in our restaurants 
openings of new restaurants by competitors in our trade areas will also impact guest traffic in our respective restaurants 
furthermore  we believe that our overall guest traffic levels will also be dependent upon consumer confidence  discretionary consumer spending and other economic conditions including energy prices  commodity inflation and overall employment 
more specifically  as of the date of this form k  comparable restaurant sales comparisons for us and many of our competitors to date for the first calendar quarter of have been negatively impacted by increased payroll taxes  delayed income tax refunds and record gasoline prices for any february according to the american automobile association that have collectively reduced the discretionary purchasing power of many lower and middle income consumers 
we cannot predict when the impact of these unfavorable conditions will begin to abate 
accordingly  we currently expect that guest traffic levels in casual dining restaurants  in general  and in our restaurants will continue to remain under significant pressure throughout in light of the difficult competitive environment  all potential menu price increases will be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  shifts in the holiday calendar  competitive restaurant intrusions into our trade areas  heavy promotional and discounting activities by our competitors  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors  as described in the risk factors section in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  can impact comparable sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage increase was primarily due to increased commodity costs and menu mix shift to higher cost of sales menu items  partially offset by increased revenues from our estimated effective menu price increases 
we do anticipate that cost of sales in our new restaurants will typically be higher during the first several months of operations than in our mature restaurants  as our restaurant management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes at our new restaurants 
accordingly  a comparatively large number of new restaurant openings in any single period may significantly impact total cost of sales comparisons for our entire business 
additionally  restaurants opened in new markets may initially experience higher commodity costs than our established restaurants  where we have greater market penetration that generally results in greater purchasing and distribution economies of scale 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and  as a result  we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
however  based on current trends and expectations  we believe the overall cost environment for food commodities will likely be subject to upward pressure during  primarily due to domestic and worldwide agricultural  supply demand and other macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control 
while we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs  and while we have taken steps to enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not significantly increase due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
additionally  there are some commodities that we are unable to contract for long periods of time  such as fluid dairy items  fresh seafood and many produce items  or where we have currently chosen not to contract for long periods of time  such as our ground beef 
there are also certain commodity items  such as certain produce items and certain seafood items  in which the contracts principally consist of collar agreements whereby the costs are subject to floors and ceilings 
it is our current intention to attempt to offset our expected commodity cost increases through certain cost savings and productivity efficiency initiatives and menu mix shifts  coupled with selective menu price increases 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be entirely successful in this respect 
the cost to produce and distribute our proprietary craft beer is included in our cost of sales 
we currently have qualified three contract brewers to produce our high quality craft beer 
during fiscal  we currently anticipate that our qualified contract brewers will produce approximately of our estimated requirement of approximately  barrels of our proprietary craft beer 
our longer term objective is to have large contract 
table of contents brewers produce substantially all of our larger volume beers 
we currently expect to continue to create and brew our smaller volume  seasonal  research and development and specialty beers 
once these beers reach higher volumes  we may eventually decide to also move the majority of this production to contract brewers as we continue to grow our restaurant base and therefore increase our demand for our proprietary craft beer 
we believe the larger scale contract brewers have greater economies of scale  stronger quality control systems and more effective  leverageable supply chain relationships than we have as a relatively small restaurant company 
additionally  this allows our brewery department to focus on creating and developing distinctive and unique beer flavors for us as opposed to focusing on the production and logistics of large scale brewing 
as a result  over the next several years  we expect that the production cost of our larger volume proprietary craft beers can be gradually reduced  while simultaneously providing an improvement in the overall consistency of our beer 
however  freight costs from our contract brewing locations may offset a portion of those production cost savings as more restaurants are developed in the east 
additionally  the cost to produce our craft beers is subject to the same inflationary pressures that affect food commodities in general 
therefore  any savings that we may achieve by moving the production of our craft beers to larger scale contract brewers may be offset by increases in commodity costs 
contract brewers also produce substantially all of our craft soda and cider products  the costs of which are also included in our cost of sales 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage increase was principally due to incremental hourly training labor resulting from the implementation of our new bj s premier rewards guest loyalty program and the introduction of our new beer master program for hourly team members as well as higher hourly kitchen labor due to the intensiveness and complexity of some of our more recent menu offerings 
included in labor and benefits for fiscal and was approximately million and million or and of revenues  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to equity awards granted in accordance with our gold standard stock ownership program for certain restaurant management team members 
our restaurants can be affected by increases in federal and state minimum wages and state unemployment insurance taxes 
additionally  some states have annual minimum wage increases correlated with either state or federal increases in the consumer price index 
in the past  we have been able to react to changes in our key operating costs  including minimum wage increases  by gradually increasing our menu prices and improving our productivity in our restaurants 
however  we cannot guarantee that all or any future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first several months of operations  if not longer in some cases  until our restaurant management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our new restaurants 
accordingly  a comparatively large number of new restaurant openings in any single quarter may significantly impact labor cost comparisons for the entire company 
occupancy and operating 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  occupancy and operating expenses increased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage increase was principally due to higher marketing  property and general liability insurance costs  and the benefit in fiscal of one extra operating week without a full complement of occupancy and other operating expenses  partially offset by our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses as a result of comparable sales increases 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal also included in general and administrative costs for fiscal and was million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher field supervision and support costs coupled with certain expenses related to our ceo transition and certain production and media costs related to our television adverting tests  partially offset by lower cash based incentive compensation expense 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal depreciation and amortization increased as a result of our construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating toolsets  restaurant remodels and initiatives 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this percentage increase was principally a result of increased construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating toolsets  restaurant remodels and initiatives and the benefit of one operating week in fiscal without related depreciation 
restaurant opening 
restaurant opening expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase is primarily due the opening of new restaurants during fiscal as compared to new restaurants during fiscal our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
loss on disposal of assets 
loss on disposal of assets decreased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal these costs were primarily related to the write off of the remaining net book value of assets related to the closure and relocation of our smaller format restaurant in boulder  colorado  coupled with the disposal of certain unproductive restaurant assets in connection with our ongoing productivity efficiency initiatives and facility image enhancement activities 
legal other settlements 
legal other settlements of approximately million  or of revenues  during fiscal were primarily related to the settlement of a trademark infringement civil action and a california sales tax audit  as compared to legal settlements of approximately million  or of revenues  during fiscal  which related to the settlements of certain california employment practices lawsuits that had been outstanding since interest income 
interest income was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal gain on investment settlement 
gain on investment settlement of approximately million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  relate to the settlement agreement reached in december with our former broker dealer for the full liquidation of our auction rate securities investment portfolio 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we were entitled to potential future recoveries of our loss on that portfolio based on the performance of those auction rate securities through december in connection with this settlement  during fiscal and fiscal  certain of these aforementioned securities were redeemed at par  resulting in additional cash recoveries 
other income  net 
other income  net  increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to greater gift card breakage income coupled with an increase in the cash surrender value of certain life insurance programs under the 
table of contents company s deferred compensation plan 
based on an analysis of our gift card program since its inception  we determined that at months after issuance date  the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal differed from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to additional tax credits 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be in the approximate range of for fiscal however  our actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pre tax income and tax credits achieved during the year and the deductibility of any subsequent disqualified dispositions related to incentive stock options 
weeks ended january  fiscal compared to the weeks ended december  fiscal revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately million in sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base  an approximate million  or  increase in comparable restaurant sales on a week basis  and million of sales due to the rd week 
on a week basis  the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an estimated effective menu price increase factor of approximately  coupled with an estimated benefit from increased estimated guest traffic and an estimated benefit from a favorable menu mix shift and guest purchase incidence rates 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased slightly to for fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
this slight percentage increase was primarily due to increased commodity costs which were partially offset by increased revenues from our estimated effective menu price increases  a favorable menu mix shift and efficiencies gained from the rollout of our automated food preparation system that enabled us to reduce food waste 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week 
as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs decreased slightly to for fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
this slight percentage decrease was primarily related to our ability to leverage our fixed and semi fixed labor costs over a higher revenue base as a result of comparable sales increases 
included in labor and benefits for fiscal and was approximately million and million or and of revenues  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units granted in accordance with our gold standard stock ownership program for certain restaurant management team members 
occupancy and operating 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants during fiscal coupled with the impact of the rd week

legal settlements 
legal settlements of approximately million or of revenues  during fiscal were primarily related to the proposed settlements of certain california employment practices lawsuits 
we agreed to these settlements  which are subject to court approval  in order to avoid the costs  risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to eliminate the further diversion of company management s time and attention  and without admitting any liability on the part of the company 
see part i item legal proceedings of this form k for additional information regarding pending and recently settled legal proceedings

liquidity and capital resources the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements dollar amounts in thousands january  january  cash and cash equivalents total marketable securities net working capital current ratio 
table of contents for the weeks ended for the weeks ended january  january  cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures our fundamental corporate finance philosophy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet in order to support our long term restaurant expansion plan with sufficient financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and brewing operations  to provide our restaurant landlords with confidence as to our intent and ability to honor all of our financial obligations under our restaurant leases  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a larger scale 
we obtain financial resources principally from our ongoing operations  supplemented by our cash and investment balances on hand  employee stock option exercises and tenant improvement allowances from our landlords 
additionally  in the past we have obtained capital resources from public stock offerings 
as an additional source of liquidity  we have a million credit facility in place that expires on january  our capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plans and restaurant enhancements and initiatives 
while our ability to achieve our growth plans is dependent on a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  our primary growth objective is to achieve an approximate increase in total restaurant operating weeks during fiscal from the development and opening of new restaurants  coupled with the carryover impact of partial year openings 
depending on the expected level of future new restaurant development and expected tenant improvement allowances that we receive from our landlords  as well as our other planned capital investments including ongoing maintenance capital expenditures  our base of established restaurant operations may not yet be large enough to generate enough cash flow from operations to totally fund our planned expansion over the longer run 
we currently estimate the total domestic capacity for our brewhouse restaurant format to be at least restaurants 
accordingly  we will continue to actively monitor overall conditions in the capital markets with respect to the potential sources and timing of additional financing for our planned future expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to secure additional capital resources  we may be required to reduce our longer term planned rate of expansion 
similar to many restaurant chains  we typically utilize operating lease arrangements principally ground leases for the majority of our restaurant locations 
we believe our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants and from time to time have purchased the underlying land for new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not currently required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets  the minimum rents and other related lease obligations  such as common area expenses  under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to evolve  maintain and increase the productive capacity of our existing base of restaurants and brewery operations and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale 
thus  we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our pro rata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost 
table of contents of developing and opening the related restaurants 
generally  landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased minimum rents 
however  in light of current conditions in the credit and real estate development markets  there can be no assurance that such allowances will continue to be available to us 
from time to time  we may also decide to purchase the underlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site 
currently  we own the land that underlies four of our operating restaurants and we have purchased the land or intend to purchase the land for three more properties scheduled for restaurant openings in fiscal it is not our current strategy to own a large number of land parcels that underlie our restaurants 
therefore  in many cases we subsequently enter into sale leaseback arrangements for land parcels that we may purchase 
we currently expect to secure approximately million of committed tenant improvement allowances and million to million in proceeds from sales leaseback transactions from our planned new restaurant openings during fiscal we disburse cash for certain site related work  buildings  leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build our leased and owned premises 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash from operations during the weeks ended january   representing a million increase from the million provided by during the week period of the increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to weeks ended january   is primarily due to higher depreciation expense as a result of more restaurants in operation coupled with the timing of prepaid expenses  offset by the timing of accounts receivable and deferred lease incentives 
for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures were approximately million  of which expenditures for the acquisition of restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the construction of our new restaurants that opened during the weeks ended january   as well as expenditures related to one additional restaurant expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal  plus the purchase of one parcel of real estate for a new restaurant expected to open in fiscal in addition  total capital expenditures related to the maintenance and key productivity initiatives of existing restaurants and expenditures for restaurant and corporate systems were million and million  respectively 
we have a million unsecured revolving line of credit line of credit that expires on january   and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we utilize the line of credit principally for letters of credit that are required to support certain of our self insurance programs and for working capital and construction requirements as needed 
borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at either libor plus a percentage not to exceed  or at a rate ranging from the financial institution s prime rate to below the financial institution s prime rate based on a lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit agreement also requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio  a lease adjusted leverage ratio and certain non financial covenants 
while we have the line of credit in place and it can be currently drawn upon  it is possible that creditors could place limitations or restrictions on our ability to borrow from the line of credit 
our capital expenditures during fiscal will continue to be significant as we currently plan to open as many as new restaurants  including one relocation of an existing restaurant  in addition to our necessary restaurant level maintenance and key initiative related capital expenditures 
as of february   we have entered into six signed leases for new restaurant locations expected to open in fiscal additionally we expect to enter into several more leases as well as purchase the underlying land for certain new restaurant locations during fiscal we currently anticipate our total capital expenditure for fiscal  including all expenditure categories to be approximately million 
we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal with current cash and investment balances on hand  expected cash flow from operations  million to million in proceeds from sales leaseback transactions and million in expected tenant improvement allowances 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of our expansion  conditions in the retail property development market  construction costs  the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants  and the nature of the specific leases and associated tenant improvement allowances available  if any  
table of contents as negotiated with landlords 
from time to time  we will evaluate opportunities to acquire and convert other restaurant locations or entire restaurant chains to the bj s restaurant concept 
we may also consider joint venture arrangements in the future to augment bj s expansion into new markets 
additionally  we may also consider a more rapid expansion of our bj s grill concept in the future 
we may also evaluate non controlling investments in other emerging restaurant concepts that offer complementary growth opportunities to our bj s restaurant operations 
currently  we have no binding commitments other than the signed leases or land purchase agreements set forth in item business restaurant site selection and expansion objectives in this form k or agreements to acquire or convert any other restaurant locations or chains to our concept  or to enter into any joint ventures or non controlling investments 
however  we would likely require additional capital resources to take advantage of any of these growth opportunities should they become feasible 
we significantly depend on our expected cash flow from operations  coupled with agreed upon landlord tenant improvement allowances and sales leaseback proceeds  to fund the majority of our planned capital expenditures for if our business does not generate enough cash flow from operations as expected  or if our landlords are unable to honor their agreements with us  or we are unable to successfully enter in a sales leaseback transaction and replacement funding sources are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other alternatives  we may not be able to expand our operations at the pace currently planned 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests 
while we have taken steps to enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather including the ongoing severe drought conditions in key domestic grain producing regions and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for certain commodities  such as fluid dairy  fresh seafood and most fresh produce items  for long periods of time 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations 
many of our restaurant team members are paid hourly rates related to the federal or state minimum wage 
in addition  numerous state and local governments have their own minimum wage requirements that are generally greater than the federal minimum wage and are subject to annual increases based on changes in their local consumer price indices 
additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such team members 
certain operating and other costs  such as health benefits  the impact from the patient protection and affordable care act  taxes  insurance and other outside services  continue to increase with the general level of inflation and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions will limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  
table of contents macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all of our future cost increases can be offset by higher menu prices or that higher menu prices will be accepted by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
additionally  our restaurants in the midwest and eastern states  including florida  will be impacted by weather and other seasonal factors that typically impact other restaurant operations in those regions 
holidays and shifts in the holiday calendar  severe winter weather  hurricanes  tornados  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of marketable securities and cash equivalents we measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted market prices in active markets 
all of our marketable securities are currently classified as held to maturity or available for sale  included as short term and long term marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
held to maturity securities are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  with related gains and losses reflected in earnings once realized and available for sale securities are reported at their fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity net of related tax effect until realized 
we believe that the fair value of our marketable securities equaled the quoted market price of our marketable securities at january  we believe the carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short term nature of those instruments 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to 
table of contents distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
when property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of  the asset account and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts are relieved  and any gain or loss is included in earnings 
additionally  any interest capitalized for new restaurant construction would be included in property and equipment  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
guest loyalty program in july  we introduced bj s premier rewards guest loyalty program to all of our restaurants 
this program enables participants to earn points for each qualifying purchase 
the points can then be redeemed for rewards including foods discounts  trips  events and other items 
we measure our total rewards obligation based on the estimated number of guests that will ultimately earn and claim rewards under the program  and record the estimated related expense as reward points accumulate 
these expenses are accrued for and recorded as marketing expenses and are included in occupancy and operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairments of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the assets are generally reviewed for impairment in total as well as on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance by the restaurant relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future restaurant cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets or for the entire restaurant 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a portion of our general liability insurance and our employee workers compensation programs 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for these programs 
the accrued liability associated with these programs is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is based on information provided by our insurance broker and a third party actuary  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future 
table of contents years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
leases we lease the majority of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases in accordance with us gaap  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
tenant improvement allowance incentives may be available to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants  pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
tenant improvement allowances can take the form of cash payments upon the opening of the related restaurants  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us or a combination thereof 
all tenant improvement allowances received by us are recorded as a deferred lease incentive and amortized over the term of the lease 
the related cash received from the landlord is reflected as landlord contribution for tenant improvements  net within financing activities of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as preopening expense 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations in which the amount of future rent is certain or can be reasonably calculated  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in some variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
in an exposure draft issued in  the fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in accounting for leases 
while the exposure draft addresses new 
table of contents financial accounting rules for both lessors and lessees  the primary focus will likely be on changes affecting lessees 
the lease accounting model contemplated by the new standard is a right of use model that assumes that each lease creates an asset the lessee s right to use the leased asset and a liability the future rent payment obligations which should be reflected on a lessee s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee s related financial obligations 
currently  all of our restaurant leases and our restaurant support center lease are accounted for as operating leases  with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
the fasb has reopened the exposure draft for comments and has therefore not identified a proposed effective date for the issuance of the final standard 
a second exposure draft is expected in the first quarter of changes in these accounting rules or their interpretation  or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 
see item a  risk factors  future changes in financial accounting standards may significantly change our reported results of operations in this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation under shareholder approved stock based compensation plans  we have granted incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  and restricted stock units that generally vest over five years and expire ten years from the date of grant 
stock based compensation is measured in accordance with us gaap based on the underlying fair value of the awards granted 
in valuing stock options  we are required to make certain assumptions and judgments regarding the grant date fair value utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
these judgments include expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected option life  dividend yield and vesting percentage 
these estimations and judgments are determined by us using many different variables that  in many cases  are outside of our control 
the changes in these variables or trends  including stock price volatility and risk free interest rate  may significantly impact the grant date fair value resulting in a significant impact to our financial results 
the cash flow tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits are required to be classified as financing cash flows 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit total for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent non cancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and other services 
additionally  we have entered into lease agreements related to future restaurants with commencement dates subsequent to january  our aggregate future commitment relating to these leases is million and is not included in operating leases above 

table of contents future minimum annual rent payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands thereafter item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term marketable securities with maturities of two years or less as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our marketable securities and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately 
as of january   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds  treasury bills  agency bonds  municipal and bank securities and domestic corporate obligations with a cost or fair value of approximately million 
cash may be in excess of fdic insurance limits 
the majority of our marketable securities  both short term and long term  are aaa rated and directly or indirectly guaranteed by the us government 
we believe we are not exposed to significant risk on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the fair market value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of january   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control  whether contracted for or not 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for some of our commodity requirements 
however  it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed price contracts for certain commodities or we may choose not to enter into fixed price contracts for certain commodities 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have some flexibility and ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
