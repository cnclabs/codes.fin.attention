part i item business our business about furiex pharmaceuticals we are a drug development collaboration company that uses innovative clinical development strategies to increase the value of partnered pharmaceutical assets and accelerate their development timelines 
we collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to increase the value of their drug candidates by applying our novel approach to drug development  which we believe expedites research and development decision making and can shorten drug development timelines 
we share the risk with our collaborators by conducting and financing drug development programs  and in exchange  we share the potential rewards  receiving milestone and royalty payments for successful drug candidates 
this business model is designed to help feed compound pipelines and deliver therapies to improve lives 
our company continues the compound partnering business started by pharmaceutical product development  inc  or ppd  in we became an independent publicly traded company on june   when ppd spun off its compound partnering business through a tax free  pro rata dividend distribution of all of the shares of the company to ppd shareholders 
ppd does not have any ownership or other form of equity interest in the company following the spin off 
the company operations are headquartered in morrisville  north carolina

business description our goal is to fully in license from or form strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses to develop and commercialize therapeutics in which the risks and rewards are shared 
we seek to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to increase the value of early stage drug candidates by applying our novel approach to drug development  which we believe expedites research and development decision making and can shorten drug development timelines 
furiex s team is staffed with key ppd team members who demonstrated proven success in the drug development collaboration business while at ppd  as well as highly qualified additional members 
our strategy is to invest in drug candidates that have a relatively straightforward path to regulatory approval and a large addressable market 
every drug candidate we review is subjected to our rigorous due diligence process by our team of experts who possess experience in all aspects of the drug development process 
once we fully in license or form an alliance  we use our drug development experience and financial resources to advance the drug candidate through clinical development 
we apply a novel approach that we believe shortens drug development timelines and transforms research and development into revenues more rapidly than the typical development cycle for such collaborations 
specifically  we set the development strategy based on a product candidate s best market position  design and manage non clinical and clinical studies  manage the drug manufacturing programs and evaluate the efficacy and safety data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the drug candidate 
we use service providers to execute the tasks needed to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
most of our collaborations involve late stage development and commercialization agreements with large pharmaceutical companies 
typically  if our collaborators are unable or unwilling to execute on late stage development and commercialization  then we have the option to seek new collaborators 
in exchange for our drug development efforts and sharing the risk with our collaborator  we are entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties based on the continued development and commercialization success of the drug candidate  as described in more detail under our portfolio below 
currently  we have rights to numerous compounds in various stages of development and commercialization  including rights to royalties and regulatory and sales based milestone payments from takeda pharmaceuticals company limited  or takeda  for alogliptin  alogliptin combination products and syr trelagliptin for the treatment of type diabetes 
in japan  takeda currently markets alogliptin under the name nesina and two fixed dose combination tablets of nesina and actos pioglitazone under the name liovel 
in january  takeda confirmed the approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  of nesina alogliptin and the fixed dose combination therapies  oseni alogliptin and pioglitazone and kazano alogliptin and metformin for treatment of type diabetes 
in september  takeda commenced phase iii clinical trials for trelagliptin in japan for treatment of type diabetes 
takeda estimates the study will complete in the second half of rights to royalties  launch based and sales based milestones from berlin chemie ag menarini group  or menarini  for priligy dapoxetine  the first approved treatment in the world for premature ejaculation 
in may  we entered into an agreement whereby alza corporation  or alza  and janssen pharmaceutica  nv  or janssen an affiliate of johnson johnson  transferred worldwide priligy rights to us 
in  we also entered into a license agreement with menarini to commercialize priligy in europe  most of asia  africa  latin america and the middle east 
priligy will continue to be made available to patients  and we will still receive royalties  under a sales service agreement with janssen  until the marketing authorizations are transferred to menarini 
priligy is currently marketed in countries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
eluxadoline  a mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist  which we call mudelta  currently in phase iii development for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs d 
we licensed mudelta from janssen in november and acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize mudelta under our existing development and license agreement in november avarofloxacin  a phase iii ready fluoroquinolone antibiotic  which we call jnj q  for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections  or absssi  and community acquired bacterial pneumonia  or cabp 
we licensed jnj q from janssen in november and acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize jnj q under our existing development and license agreement in april the following chart summarizes the status of our pipeline of compounds united states adopted names council usan adopted  international nonproprietary names inn approval pending 
our solution the drug development industry is under increasing economic pressure to develop new products more quickly and efficiently 
to address this industry issue  we have developed what we believe is a novel approach to drug development 
our approach to drug development involves applying proven solutions from our extensive global drug development experience to reduce development timelines and expedite the decision making cycle  planning for success and bridging steps in development by conducting earlier elements of a program while simultaneously planning for later phases of development 
in order to obtain regulatory approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies around the world to market a drug  certain data about the safety and efficacy of the drug is required 
to obtain such data  drug developers frequently choose to run studies sequentially 
for example  they might run one study  wait to see the results  and then they run the next study 
developers prefer this approach primarily to limit upfront expenditures since the success of any given study is not known and the decision might be made not to move forward due to negative data 
however  this sequential approach slows down the development process 
we approach drug development by minimizing the time it takes to bring products to the market 
our novel approach manages drug development with parallel processing and efficient decision making 
we use our drug development experience to predict possible outcomes of a study and take risks based on those predictions 
by assuming success at each critical decision point in advance  as opposed to waiting for results  development time is reduced 
in addition  we seek to mitigate risks by contingency planning for potential problems 
as a result  we can accelerate the development process by bridging steps across the developmental program as well as between studies 
additionally  we focus our efforts on only those essential studies necessary for regulatory approval 
this helps to shorten developmental timelines 
two key elements to our approach are our due diligence process and our planning for the success of each compound 
before we enter into a collaboration for a compound  we subject it to an intense due diligence review covering every step in the development process  from preclinical and clinical studies through marketing approval 
we generally look for  and enter into collaborations with respect to  compounds that have the following characteristics address medical conditions with a significant unmet need  a reasonable development time  reasonable predictability of non clinical models  clinical evidence no later than phase ib  a solid patent estate  acceptable estimated cost of goods  and attractive economic terms with the compound s innovator and ultimate commercial collaborator 
if a compound passes our rigorous diligence review hurdles  we then plan the entire development timeline upfront  using a set of assumptions 
part of the upfront planning involves initiating long term studies  such as carcinogenicity studies  earlier than usual 
we also use real time data analysis tools to monitor the clinical study data of a drug candidate 
by initiating long term studies earlier and reviewing data in real time  we can significantly reduce the time needed after the conclusion of clinical studies to complete the necessary documentation for regulatory filing 
we believe this approach works well because the core development team is empowered to make decisions  real time technology tools facilitate rapid data review  development programs are designed to optimize market position and timelines are driven by science and must have studies 
the resulting ability to reduce development timelines in turn allows us to capitalize more quickly on our investment 
we believe our success evolves from our development efficiency 
according to the tufts university center for the study of drug development outlook  since the average time from the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  to the filing of a new drug application  or nda  is over eight years 
by contrast  we advanced alogliptin as a treatment for type diabetes for the monotherapy program from ind to nda in only months 
our business strategy our strategy is to fully in license and develop novel early stage drug candidates that address medical conditions with significant unmet need 
we invest in innovative early stage drug candidates whose targets have scientific or clinical validation  and in disease areas that have a relatively straightforward path to regulatory approval 
we leverage our extensive drug development expertise to implement efficient and high quality development programs that accelerate time to market 
we progress drug candidates to key value inflection points and form strategic collaborations with commercial pharmaceutical companies in exchange for milestones and royalties 
we subject each potential drug candidate we consider to a rigorous review process by our due diligence team  which has expertise in all aspects of drug development  as well as in intellectual property and commercial assessment 
this approach has enabled us to build a diversified portfolio of drug candidates and commercialized products that offer value to patients  our investors and collaborators 
our portfolio we have exclusive license rights to one compound that is in phase iii development mudelta and another jnj q that is phase iii ready 
we also have one compound  trelagliptin syr  in phase iii development with a collaborator  and three products that are commercialized by collaborators  for which we are eligible to receive regulatory or launch based milestone payments plus worldwide sales based royalty and sales based milestone payments 
the commercialized products  nesina  liovel and priligy  are currently marketed outside of the united states  and we have no further development obligations for any of these products or syr compounds in clinical development mudelta eluxadoline for diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome affects approximately million patients in the united states and the five major european union countries  and is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea 
studies have demonstrated that ibs d is associated with work absenteeism  high medical costs and low quality of life 
we believe the market for prescription treatments for ibs d is underserved due to the limited number of available treatments and the adverse side effects associated with those treatments 
mudelta is a novel  orally active  investigational agent in phase iii development  with combined mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist activity 
the compound dual opioid activity is designed to treat diarrhea and pain symptoms of ibs d  without causing the constipating side effects that occur with mu opioid agonists 
mudelta acts locally in the gut and has very low oral bioavailability  thus limiting the potential for systemic side effects  such as sedation 
in january  the fda granted fast track designation to the mudelta ibs d program 
fast track is a process for facilitating the development and expediting the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill unmet medical needs  with the goal of bringing important new drugs to patients earlier 
in  we completed a large multicenter randomized double blind phase ii proof of concept trial in patients with ibs d  which demonstrated that mudelta has a favorable efficacy and safety profile 
key findings from the phase ii proof of concept study results are summarized below the study reached statistical significance for the primary endpoint of improvement in stool consistency and abdominal pain at week four of treatment  which was developed prior to the release of the fda ibs guidance in  as well as secondary endpoints of adequate relief of ibs d symptoms at weeks  and importantly  the favorable efficacy results were supported by a post hoc responder analysis  using the composite endpoint of improvement in daily pain and diarrheal symptoms over weeks  consistent with the fda final guidance  mudelta showed statistically and clinically meaningful differences compared with placebo at both the mg bid and mg bid doses 
at our end of phase ii meeting and also through written communications  the fda agreed that the aforementioned endpoint is an acceptable primary endpoint for phase iii pivotal studies  we believe this provides a clear regulatory path for the program 
we also believe that our favorable phase ii study results with this endpoint bodes well for the phase iii program 
in june  we began two phase iii pivotal studies in parallel 
both trials have the same overall design and efficacy endpoints  but differ in overall duration due to the need to treat and monitor safety in a sufficient number of patients to satisfy regulatory requirements 
each study captures both the week fda endpoint as well as longer term efficacy data for up to weeks  the latter of which might be used to support a european regulatory submission 
each study will have three treatment arms  placebo  mg twice a day and mg twice a day  with approximately patients per arm 
our total enrollment target is  patients 
in november  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize mudelta under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of mudelta 
based on our existing agreement  we will continue developing and commercializing the compound and janssen may receive up to million in regulatory milestone payments and  if approved for marketing  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties are to be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
recent events as of february  we had recruited over of patients needed to complete the phase iii trials 
we have more than study sites in north america and more than study sites in the united kingdom 
we are actively exploring both partnering and funding opportunities to support the phase iii development of mudelta 
jnj q avarofloxacin for skin and lung infections community acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections are important public health concerns due to increasing drug resistance of established antibiotics to causative pathogens 
due to the emerging resistance to established antibiotics  there is a large unmet need for antibiotics such as jnj q that cover a broad range of pathogens  including resistant staphylococcus staph and streptococcus strep  and that have the potential for both intravenous and oral use 
bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
global microbiological surveillance suggests that approximately of staph infections in the us  latin america and asia pacific are methicillin resistant staphylococcus staph aureus  or mrsa 
according to global data  the global mrsa market was valued at million in and is projected to exceed billion by the pneumonia therapeutics market was valued at billion in with billion value forecast for due to expected patent expirations 
jnj q is a novel broad spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is phase iii ready for two indications absssi and cabp 
jnj q has a low propensity to cause drug resistance in vitro and has potent activity against two important drug resistant pathogens mrsa and drug resistant streptococcus pneumonia 
in addition  jnj q is highly active against other common and difficult to treat bacteria  including those that are gram positive  atypical and anaerobic  as well as some gram negative bacteria 
this broad bactericidal spectrum gives jnj q an advantage over many other antibiotics  which do not reliably treat polymicrobial skin and wound infections or such a wide variety of respiratory pathogens 
jnj q is active against resistant pathogens that might be used in bioterrorism and also against drug resistant gonorrhea 
it can be dosed both intravenously and orally  differentiating it from many other mrsa treatments that are only dosed intravenously 
in april  we acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize jnj q under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired rights to jnj q as a result of janssen decision not to exercise its option under the agreement  which gave janssen the opportunity to continue development of jnj q this decision was related to janssen announcement that it would not be investing in new antibacterial therapies 
based on our existing agreement  janssen may receive up to million in regulatory milestone payments  and if approved for marketing  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties would be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
we are continuing to seek to partner or out license jnj q  however  the partnering environment for antibacterial agents remains challenging 
we have forecasted minimal expenditures for this compound in recent events in february  jnj q was granted a qualified infectious disease product and fast track designation from the fda 
these designations should enable us and or any future collaborator with respect to the compound to benefit from certain incentives for the development of new antibiotics  including priority review and additional five year market exclusivity  as provided under the generating antibiotic incentives now gain act  which is incorporated within the fda safety and innovation act of marketed products nesina alogliptin for type diabetes type diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and has reached worldwide epidemic proportions 
the global health care expenditures to treat and prevent diabetes and its complications were estimated at billion in by  this number is projected to exceed billion 
in addition to diet and exercise  diabetic patients often require multiple medicines to help manage their condition 
nesina  which is marketed by takeda  is the trade name for alogliptin 
nesina is a highly selective orally active dipeptidyl peptidase  or dpp  inhibitor that slows the inactivation of hormones known as incretins glucagon like peptide and glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide  which play a major role in regulating blood sugar levels and might improve pancreatic function 
approximately  patients with type diabetes have been treated with nesina in randomized  double blind  controlled clinical trials 
pivotal trials demonstrated that nesina was well tolerated when given as a single daily dose and it significantly improved glycemic control in type diabetes patients without raising the incidence of hypoglycemia 
additionally  nesina has been shown to enhance glycemic control when used in combination with other commonly prescribed diabetes drugs 
nesina is approved for combination use in japan with a variety of other diabetes drugs including glucosidase inhibitors  sulfonylureas  biguanides  and actos  and is also marketed in japan as a fixed dose combination with actos  known as liovel 
takeda is conducting a prospective study of alogliptin known as the examine trial  which is a cardiovascular outcomes study of subjects with type diabetes and a history of acute coronary syndrome 
we have no further financial obligations under our agreement with takeda 
under this agreement  we will be entitled to receive up to million in future regulatory milestone payments for eu marketing authorization  and up to million in sales based milestone payments 
in addition  we are entitled to receive payments on worldwide sales of nesina based on royalty rates of to in the us  to in europe and japan and to in regions other than the us  europe or japan 
royalty payments are subject to a reduction of up to for a portion of payments by takeda to a licensor for intellectual property related to nesina except in japan  where there is currently no intellectual property that would cause such a reduction 
royalties are to be paid for the later of ten years following the first commercial sale or two years following the expiration of the last to expire patent 
for combination product sales outside the us  takeda must pay us royalties based on the proportion of nesina average sales price compared to that of the combination product 
for sales in the u 
s  the royalties for combination product sales are based on an agreed upon percent of product sales 
recent events on january   takeda confirmed the approval from the fda of three new type diabetes therapies  nesina alogliptin and the fixed dose combination therapies  oseni alogliptin and pioglitazone and kazano alogliptin and metformin  for the treatment of type diabetes 
oseni is the first dpp inhibitor and thiazolidinedione combination product approved in the us these approvals triggered a million milestone payment to us  which we received on february   as well as potential royalties on sales in the united states and potential sales based milestones 
the eu marketing application  which takeda submitted in the second quarter of  continues to progress  and takeda expects a regulatory decision about marketing approval in the latter half of additional marketing applications are under review in the emerging markets 
priligy dapoxetine for premature ejaculation the reported percentage of men affected with premature ejaculation  or pe  at some point during their lives ranges from to  depending on the methodology and criteria used 
priligy is the trade name for dapoxetine  a drug in tablet form specifically indicated for the on demand treatment of pe 
priligy is a unique  short acting  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  or ssri  designed to be taken only when needed  one to three hours before sexual intercourse  rather than every day 
priligy has been studied in over  patients in clinical trials  including five randomized  placebo controlled phase iii clinical trials involving more than  men with pe 
it is the first oral medication to be approved for this condition 
priligy is approved in over countries and currently marketed in countries in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
in may  we entered into an agreement whereby alza and janssen transferred worldwide priligy rights to us 
in may  we also entered into a license agreement with menarini to commercialize priligy in europe  most of asia  africa  latin america and the middle east 
we will retain full development and commercialization rights in the united states  japan and canada 
janssen will continue to make priligy available to patients  until marketing authorizations are transferred to menarini 
janssen will also manufacture and manage certain clinical and regulatory activities for priligy for pre defined periods 
under our license agreement with menarini  we received a million upfront payment and million of regulatory milestone payments  and are eligible to receive up to million in launch milestones and up to million in sales based milestones  plus tiered royalties ranging from the mid teens to mid twenties in percentage terms 
we are obligated to pay million to janssen for transition services 
as of december   we had paid million related to these transition services and will owe the remaining million in the first quarter of we must also pay janssen fees for the product sales and distribution activities that they will perform as part of a sales service agreement 
in addition  we may incur up to million for reasonable out of pocket expenses over the transition period 
menarini is obligated to pay for the current on going clinical studies 
we now hold the us ind for priligy 
at this time  we do not have plans to re submit the nda that janssen filed in  as our primary development focus is our mudelta program 
furthermore  the fda has not provided guidance on patient reported outcomes that it considers acceptable for studies of premature ejaculation 
we will continue to monitor the situation and might reassess our strategy should circumstances change 
we originally acquired patents for priligy from eli lilly and company  or lilly  and are obligated to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales in excess of million 
in addition  under the terms of the license agreement with menarini  we remain responsible for payment of royalties to lilly  except menarini will pay the portion of the royalties owed to lilly in each country where menarini is licensed to sell priligy  where lilly is eligible for payments  and where we are no longer eligible for payments from menarini 
recent events the transition of priligy is progressing as planned  country specific marketing authorization licenses are continuing to transfer from janssen to menarini  and menarini is now marketing priligy in some countries 
we anticipate that in  menarini should be able to launch or re launch priligy in key commercial markets 
compound in clinical development by collaborator trelagliptin for type diabetes trelagliptin syr is part of the dpp inhibitor portfolio that takeda purchased from ppd and syrrx in trelagliptin has the same mechanism of action as alogliptin 
however  in contrast to alogliptin  which is a once daily oral therapy  trelagliptin is a once weekly oral agent 
takeda completed two phase ii studies in early  the primary endpoint of which was hba c at weeks 
in september  takeda commenced phase iii clinical trials for trelagliptin in japan for treatment of type diabetes 
takeda is currently conducting a week open label study in japan in approximately subjects who are not well controlled on diet and exercise or another oral anti diabetic drug  and a week double blind study of trelagliptin compared to placebo or alogliptin 
currently  all available dpp inhibitors are dosed once daily 
a once weekly treatment  such as trelagliptin  should provide patients with a convenient therapeutic alternative  and has the potential to improve treatment compliance 
if trelagliptin is approved  then we would be eligible to receive sales based royalty payments at the same rates as for nesina  as described above 
under our agreement with takeda  we would be entitled to receive regulatory milestone payments for trelagliptin or nesina  whichever compound achieves the milestone s first 
we would also be entitled to receive sales based milestone payments based on global product sales 
our drug development capabilities the drug development capabilities of our executive officer team embodies over years of research and development experience 
this experience includes a deep understanding of the biological causes of human diseases and the factors that impact all aspects of successful drug development such as manufacturing  formulation  the cause of drug side effects  drug interactions and drug pharmacokinetics 
we believe that our drug development capability and proven success rate will continue to provide a pipeline of unique compounds 
depending upon the availability of our development resources  other drug candidates might be added to our own internal clinical pipeline  or out licensed to other companies for clinical development and commercialization 
our patents and other proprietary rights patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our assets  and also to rely upon trade secrets  know how and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents and have approximately us and us pending patent applications 
we have a policy to seek worldwide patent protection for our products and have foreign patent rights corresponding to most of our us patents 
we license the rights to the following material patents related to our product candidates mudelta 
licensed from janssen 
the license continues as long as we meet our obligations to janssen and we have marketing rights to the compound 
as of december   us and foreign patents have been issued to janssen in this patent family 
additional us and foreign patent applications are still pending 
jnj q licensed from janssen 
the license continues as long as we meet our obligations to janssen and we have marketing rights to the compound 
as of december   us and foreign patents have been issued to janssen in this patent family 
additional us and foreign patent applications are still pending 
pursuant to the terms of the uruguay round agreements act  patents issued from applications filed on or after june   have a term of years from the date of filing  no matter how long it takes for the patent to issue 
because patent applications in the pharmaceutical industry often take a long time to issue  this method of patent term calculation can result in a shorter period of patent protection afforded to us compared to the prior method of term calculation  which was years from the date of issue 
our issued us patents expire between and  excluding any potential patent term extension available under us federal law 
we actively seek full patent term adjustment following allowance of a patent 
we also actively seek patent term extensions following marketing approval 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of and the generic animal drug and patent term restoration act of  a patent that claims a product  use or method of manufacture covering drugs may be extended for up to five years to compensate the patent holder for a portion of the time required for fda review 
while we file and prosecute patent applications to protect our inventions  our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of patents or our issued patents might not provide competitive advantages 
also  our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology 
in addition to seeking the protection of patents and licenses  we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation  which we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and licensees 
the scope  enforceability and effective term of issued patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims in pharmaceutical patents  so that even issued patents might later be modified or revoked by the relevant patent authorities or courts 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country  and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country 
the patents we obtain and the unpatented proprietary technology we hold might not afford us significant commercial protection 
additional information regarding risks associated with our patents and other proprietary rights that affect our business is contained under the headings we must protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to succeed and we might need to obtain patent licenses from others in order to manufacture or sell our potential products and we might not be able to obtain these licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all under the heading risk factors 
manufacturing and supply we currently rely on our collaborators and contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  with oversight by our internal managers 
we plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug candidates if and when approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory agency 
we generally rely on one manufacturer for the active pharmaceutical ingredient and another manufacturer for the formulated drug product for each of our drug candidate programs 
at the early stage of clinical studies  we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any supplier  or that additional manufacturers would be beneficial due the possibility of changes in the method of manufacturing of the drug candidate 
as a drug candidate moves to later stages of development and the drug formulation method is established  we  or our collaboration partners  might then seek additional manufacturers for the drug 
sales and marketing we currently have no marketing  sales or distribution capabilities 
we plan to rely on third party collaborators to market our products  like alza and menarini for priligy and takeda for nesina and related products  and therefore we are subject to the strategic marketing decisions of such third parties 
we generally plan to out license our commercial rights in a territory to a third party with marketing  sales and distribution capabilities in exchange for one or more of the following up front payments  research funding  development funding  milestone payments  and royalties on drug sales 
in some instances  and at some point in the future  we might choose to develop our own staff for marketing  sales or distribution 
government regulation the manufacturing  testing  labeling  approval and storage of our products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries at the federal  state and local level  including the fda 
the process of obtaining approval for a new pharmaceutical product or for additional therapeutic indications within this regulatory framework requires expenditure of substantial resources and usually takes several years 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  including us  have suffered significant setbacks in various stages of clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials after promising results had been obtained in earlier trials 
the process for obtaining fda approval of drug candidates customarily begins with the filing of an ind with the fda for the use of a drug candidate to treat a particular indication 
if the fda accepts the ind  we would then start human clinical trials to determine  among other things  the proper dose  safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in the stated indication 
the clinical trial process is customarily divided into three phases phase i  phase ii and phase iii 
each successive phase is generally larger and more time consuming and expensive than the preceding phase 
throughout each phase we are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the fda 
even after a drug is approved and being marketed for commercial use  the fda may require that we conduct additional trials  including phase iv trials  to further study safety or efficacy 
as part of the regulatory approval process  we  or our collaboration partners  must demonstrate to the fda the ability to manufacture a pharmaceutical product before we receive marketing approval 
our products must conform to rigorous standards regarding manufacturing and quality control procedures in order to receive fda approval 
the validation of these procedures is a costly endeavor 
pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to inspections by the fda and local authorities as well as inspections by authorities of other countries 
to supply pharmaceutical products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturers must comply with these fda approved guidelines 
these foreign manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by corresponding regulatory agencies in these countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
moreover  state  local and other authorities may also regulate pharmaceutical product manufacturing facilities 
before we are able to manufacture commercial products  we  or our collaboration partners  as the case may be  must meet fda guidelines 
both before and after marketing approval is obtained  a pharmaceutical product  its manufacturer and the holder of the biologics license application  or bla  or nda for the pharmaceutical product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
the fda may deny approval to a bla or nda if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
moreover  even if regulatory approval is granted  such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
further  marketing approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems with the pharmaceutical product occur following approval 
in addition  under a bla or nda  the manufacturer of the product continues to be subject to facility inspections and the applicant must assume responsibility for compliance with applicable pharmaceutical product and establishment standards 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences  which may include  among other adverse actions  withdrawal of the previously approved pharmaceutical product or marketing approvals or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or bla or nda holder 
for the development of pharmaceutical products outside the united states  we and our collaborator partners are subject to foreign regulatory requirements  and the ability to market a drug is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
in countries other than european union countries  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level 
within the european union  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
clinical trial applications must be filed with the relevant regulatory authority in each country in which we would want to conduct a clinical trial 
assuming approval and the success of any clinical trial  we would then need to seek marketing approval for the drug 
the process for obtaining marketing approval of drug candidates in the european union begins with the filing with the european medicines agency  or ema  of a marketing authorization application for the use of a drug candidate to treat a particular indication 
similar processes and outcomes of such human clinical trials that are required by the fda are also required by the ema including testing for dose  safety and efficacy in three phases 
similar to the fda  the european regulators subject us to extensive regulation and oversight throughout each phase 
even after a drug is approved and being marketed for commercial use  the ema may require that additional trials be conducted  including phase iv trials  to further study safety or efficacy 
as a result  the ema regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
if and when necessary  we  or our collaboration partners  will choose the appropriate route of european or other international regulatory filing to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals 
requirements relating to manufacturing  conduct of clinical trials and product licensing vary widely in different countries  and the chosen regulatory strategy might not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of our chosen product indications 
in addition  if a particular product to be used outside of the united states is manufactured in the united states  fda requirements and us export provisions will apply 
outside of the united states  many countries require that a pricing approval be obtained in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching the product in the approving country 
we  or our collaboration partners  might encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs or price controls in our respective efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals 
failure to obtain pricing approval in a timely manner or approval of pricing which would support an adequate return on investment or generate a sufficient margin to justify the economic risk might delay or prohibit the commercial launch of the product in those countries 
the marketing and sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to strict regulation 
promotional materials and activities must comply with the approving agency s regulations and other guidelines 
physicians may prescribe pharmaceutical or biologic products for uses that are not described in a product s labeling or differ from those approved by the approving agency 
while such off label uses are common and regulatory agencies do not regulate physicians choice of treatments  many approving agencies restrict a company s communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot promote approved pharmaceutical or biologic products for off label uses 
if any advertising or promotional activities we  or our collaboration partners  undertake fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines regarding off label use  we  or our collaboration partners  may be subject to warnings or enforcement action 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are global companies with substantially greater resources than we have to develop and commercialize their drugs and drug candidates 
potential competitors have developed and are developing compounds for treating the same indications as our product candidates 
in addition  a number of academic and commercial organizations are actively pursuing similar technologies and several companies have developed or might develop technologies that might compete with our compounds 
priligy  indicated for premature ejaculation  competes with cromadyn  a generic paroxetine sold by more pharmaceuticals in mexico 
additional competition includes off label treatment with chronically dosed ssris eg paroxetine  fluoxetine 
we are aware of two other compounds in development for premature ejaculation pd phase iii a novel formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine being developed by shionogi that is administered topically  and zertane phase iii a re purposed formulation of tramadol a centrally acting oral opioid mu receptor agonist with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitory activities being developed by ampio pharma 
nesina competes in the type diabetes space with three dpp inhibitors currently on the market  bristol myers squibb astrazeneca s onglyza saxagliptin  boehringer ingelheim lilly s tradjenta linagliptin and merck s januvia sitagliptin 
merck also markets janumet and janumet xr  fixed dose combinations of sitagliptin and metformin  boehringer ingelheim lilly also market jentadueto  a combination of linagliptin and metformin and bristol myers squibb astrazeneca also market kombiglyze  a combination of saxagliptin and extended release metformin 
in japan  there are two additional dpp inhibitors on the market  mitsubishi tanabe daiichi sankyo s tenelia tenagliptin and sanwa kowa s suiny anagliptin 
novartis markets the dpp inhibitor galvus vildagliptin and eucreas vildagliptin and metformin in europe 
other marketed oral anti diabetic competitors include generic metformin  generic sulfonylureas and generic thiazolidinediones 
the diabetes pipeline is crowded  with  to our knowledge  over compounds in phase i development  approximately in phase ii development and approximately in phase iii development or preregistration 
in addition to dpp inhibitors  competitors are also developing glp agonists  sglt antagonists  ppar agonists and compounds with other mechanisms for treatment of diabetes 
other companies with dpp inhibitors in clinical development of which we are aware include amgen servier  arisaph pharmaceuticals  dong a pharmaceuticals south korea  dainippon sumitomo pharma  phenomix  glenmark pharmaceuticals  kyorin pharmaceuticals and lg life sciences south korea 
if approved  jnj q will compete with other fluoroquinolones currently on the market  including johnson and johnson s levaquin levofloxacin  bayer merck s avelox moxifloxacin  bayer merck s cipro ciprofloxacin and cornerstone therapeutics s factive gemifloxacin 
generic versions of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are currently available  and generic versions of moxifloxacin will likely become available when the patents covering these products expire in if jnj q is found to be effective against mrsa infections  it would compete with pfizer s zyvox linezolid  cubist s cubicin daptomycin  wyeth s tygacil tigecycline  theravance s vibativ telavancin  forest s teflaro ceftaroline and the generic drug vancomycin 
companies developing compounds to treat mrsa infections in clinical trials include baselia  nabriva  trius  paratek  cempra  durata  affinium  e therapeutics  fab pharma  medicines company  novexel now astrazeneca  phico therapeutics  polymedix  rib x pharmaceuticals  taigen  theravance and wockhardt india 
the rib x and wockhardt compounds are both fluoroquinolones 
in addition  merlion pharmaceuticals is developing a fluoroquinolone in phase ii 
merck and biota pharmaceuticals are both developing vaccines against staphylococcus aureus 
if approved  mudelta will compete with lotronex alosetron  marketed by prometheus laboratories 
the following generic opiates and or antispasmodic agents are also used for diarrhea predominant ibs loperamide imodium  an over the counter anti diarrheal  diphenoxylate atropine an opiate anticholinergic agent and dicyclomine 
in the asia pacific region  ramosetron a ht antagonist is marketed under various brand names  as a treatment for diarrhea predominant ibs 
the pipeline for diarrhea predominant ibs includes asimadoline  which is being developed by tioga pharmaceuticals and is in phase iii  rifaximin  an antibiotic approved product for hepatic encephalopathy that is the subject of a supplemental nda by salix pharmaceuticals  ast  currently in phase ii development by ocera  ibodutant nk antagonist  currently in phase ii development by menarini group  dextofisopam  currently in phase ii development by pharmos corporation  and lx a serotonin synthesis inhibitor  currently in phase ii development by lexicon pharmaceuticals 
competitors might succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our products or that would render our products or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
our collaborators might also independently develop products that are competitive with products that we have licensed to them 
any product that we or our collaborators succeed in developing and for which regulatory approval is obtained must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
the relative speed with which we and our collaborators can develop products  complete clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market compared to competitive companies will affect market success 
in addition  the amount of marketing and sales resources  and the effectiveness of the marketing used with respect to a product will affect its success 
in addition  some clinical research organizations  or cro  service providers and private equity funds are developing risk sharing models to finance the pharmaceutical industry s pipeline 
novaquest is active in this business 
as these types of business models evolve  there will be increasing competition for compounds and funds that will affect our ability to add to our portfolio 
other competitive factors affecting our business generally include product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  marketing and sales capabilities  reimbursement coverage  the amount of clinical benefit of our product candidates relative to their cost  method of and frequency of administration of any of our product candidates which may be commercialized  patent protection of our product candidates  the capabilities of our collaborators  and the ability to hire qualified personnel 
employees we have full time employees  a majority of whom are engaged in research and development activities 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors our business operations face a number of risks 
these risks should be read and considered with other information provided in this report 
risks relating to furiex s business we anticipate that we will incur additional losses 
we might never achieve or sustain profitability 
if additional capital is not available  we might have to curtail or cease operations 
our business has experienced significant net losses 
we had net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will continue to incur additional net losses until revenues from all sources reach a level sufficient to support our on going operations 
because we or our collaborators or licensees might not successfully develop additional products  obtain required regulatory approvals  manufacture products at an acceptable cost or with appropriate quality  or successfully market products with desired margins  our expenses might continue to exceed any revenues we receive 
our commitment of resources to the continued development of our products might require significant additional funds for development 
our operating expenses also might increase if we move our earlier stage potential products into later stage clinical development  as we have done with mudelta  encounter problems during clinical development that require a change in scope and or timelines  pursue clinical development of our potential products in new indications  increase the number of patents we are prosecuting or otherwise expend additional resources on patent prosecution or defense  or invest in or acquire additional technologies  product candidates or businesses 
in the absence of substantial licensing  milestone and other revenues from third party collaborators  royalties on sales of products under our agreements with collaborators  future revenues from our products in development or other sources of revenues  we will continue to incur operating losses and might require additional capital to fully execute our business strategy 
the likelihood of reaching  and time required to reach  sustained profitability are highly uncertain 
although we expect that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations and working capital requirements for at least the next months based on current operating plans  we might need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our research and development programs  acquire complementary businesses or technologies  respond to competitive pressures  or commercialize our product candidates 
our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the scope  duration and expenditures associated with our research and development programs  continued progress in these programs  the outcome of potential licensing transactions  if any  competing technological developments  the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  and the cost of attracting and retaining employees 
we might seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
general market conditions might make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets 
we might have to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not optimal to us  in order to raise additional funds 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and reduce overhead expenses  or restructure or cease operations 
these actions might reduce the market price of our common stock 
our near term revenue is largely dependent on the success of nesina and priligy and we cannot be certain of the extent that our collaborators will be able to obtain regulatory approval for or obtain commercial success of drugs 
we currently are relying on nesina and related products  and priligy to generate revenue 
while priligy is approved for marketing outside of the us  it has not been approved in the us and the fda issued a not approvable letter with respect to the compound in october we currently do not have plans to re submit the nda 
while nesina is approved for marketing in japan and was approved for marketing in january for the us  takeda  our collaborative partner  continues to seek approval in europe 
we have also invested a significant amount of time and financial resources in the development of mudelta 
our future success might depend in part on our  or our collaborator s  ability to successfully complete phase iii clinical trials for mudelta  which began in june we have also invested a significant amount of time and financial resources in the development of jnj q fda guidance for developing drugs to treat community acquired bacterial pneumonia includes challenging requirements for the drug developer 
our future success might depend in part on our collaborator s ability to successfully complete the phase iii trial for this pneumonia indication using jnj q in view of the fda guidelines 
we anticipate that our success will depend largely on the receipt of regulatory approval and successful commercialization of these drug candidates 
the future success of these drug candidates will depend on several factors  including the following our ability to provide acceptable evidence of their safety and efficacy  receipt of marketing approval from the fda and any similar foreign regulatory authorities  our or our partners ability to obtain and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers or establishing commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  collaborating with pharmaceutical companies or contract sales organizations to further develop  market and sell any approved drug  and acceptance of any approved drug in the medical community and by patients and third party payors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue generating revenues through the sale of priligy  nesina and related products or generate any revenue from the sale of other product candidates 
our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our late stage product candidates depends on our ability to find new collaborators 
our ability to succeed in our drug development business by advancing our late stage product candidates through phase iii clinical trials will depend on our ability to successfully find collaborators able to fund and execute late stage development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we generally conduct our drug development business in two stages 
during the first stage  we in license a product candidate from a collaborator and develop that candidate through phase ii clinical trials 
if the product candidate successfully completes phase ii testing  we would likely enter a second stage during which we seek a collaborator  which might or might not be the same collaborator as in the first stage  for the continued late stage development and ultimate commercialization of the product candidate 
janssen  our original collaborator for mudelta and jnj q  has elected not to continue development of these two product candidates 
if we cannot find a collaborator for final development and commercialization  we might not be able to complete the development and commercialization on our own due to the significant costs associated with these activities 
as a result  we may not be able to recoup all or any part of our investment in the product candidate 
our milestone and royalty payments from collaborators and the successful development and marketing of our product candidates depends on our collaborators continuing to develop and commercialize the product candidates 
if our collaborators are not successful or choose not to develop these compounds  we might not receive future payment 
the drug development industry is under increasing economic pressure 
the third parties with which we collaborate might not perform their obligations as expected or they might breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully or in a timely manner 
further  parties collaborating with us might not devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  regulatory strategy and approvals  marketing or sale of these product candidates 
if the parties to our collaborative agreements do not fulfill their obligations  elect not to develop a candidate or fail to devote sufficient resources to it  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  our ability to further develop potential products could be severely limited 
an example of the way we rely on our collaborators is continued cooperation from alza and janssen under our may agreement to transfer the existing regulatory licenses and license applications as set forth in the agreement 
we have agreements under which we rely on collaborators to manufacture our product candidates and essential components for those product candidates  design and conduct clinical trials  compile and analyze the data received from these trials  obtain regulatory approvals and  if approved  market these products 
as a result  we might have limited or no control over the manufacturing  development and marketing of these potential products 
in addition  the performance of our collaborators might not be sufficient or appropriate for regulatory review and approval for our product candidates 
further  we often rely on one manufacturer or other collaborator for such services  the loss of which could significantly delay the development of any of our product candidates 
our milestone and royalty payments rely on the performance of our collaborators and would be impacted by any delay or termination by our collaborators 
our collaborators can terminate our collaborative agreements under certain conditions 
a collaborator may terminate its agreement with us or separately pursue alternative products  therapeutic approaches or technologies as a means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by us  or our collaborative effort 
even if a collaborator continues to contribute to the arrangement  it might nevertheless decide not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
in these circumstances  our ability to further develop potential products could be severely limited 
while we generally seek non compete terms in our agreements with our collaborators for the products we are developing  the enforcement of a non compete can be expensive and difficult to monitor and enforce and might be subject to being invalidated by a court or judge 
continued funding and participation by collaborators will depend on the continued timely achievement of our research and development objectives  the retention of key personnel performing work under those agreements and on each collaborator s own financial  competitive  marketing and strategic capabilities and priorities 
these considerations include the commitment of each collaborator s management to the continued development of the licensed products or technology  the relationships among the individuals responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the development efforts  and the relative advantages of alternative products or technology being marketed or developed by each collaborator or by others  including their relative patent and proprietary technology positions  and their ability to manufacture potential products successfully 
the willingness of our existing collaborators to continue development of our potential products and our ability to enter into new relationships depends upon  among other things  our patent position with respect to such products 
if we are unable to successfully obtain and maintain patents  we might be unable to collect royalties on existing licensed products or enter into additional agreements 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates or are unable to establish our own sales and marketing capabilities  we might be unable to generate product revenue 
we do not currently have the resources to sell  market or distribute any pharmaceutical products 
in order to market any of our products that receive regulatory approval  we must make arrangements with third parties to perform these services  or build our sales  marketing  managerial and other non technical capabilities  which would be difficult  expensive and time consuming 
if we are unable to do so  we might not be able to generate product revenue and might not become profitable 
we might obtain future financing through the issuance of debt or equity or other forms of financing  which might have an adverse effect on our shareholders or otherwise adversely affect our business 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity or other forms of financing  any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation 
in such event  there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled  there might be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of our common stock 
in addition  if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity  whether through private placements or public offerings  such an issuance would dilute the ownership of our then current shareholders 
the terms of debt securities might also impose restrictions on our operations  which might include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock  or to make certain acquisitions or investments 
for example  under our loan and security agreement with midcap funding iii  llc  midcap funding re holdings  llc and silicon valley bank  we are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants  including that we may not enter into a merger or consolidation or certain change of control events or incur additional indebtedness  in each case subject to certain customary exceptions 
in addition  we might be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios  and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control 
our operating expenses and results and any revenue likely will fluctuate in future periods 
our revenues and expenses are unpredictable and likely will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  the timing and the unpredictable nature of clinical trials and related expenses  including payments owed by us and to us under collaborative agreements for reimbursement of expenses  future milestone revenues under collaborative agreements  royalties owed to us related to sales of priligy and nesina and related products and any royalty payments which may be owed by us under collaborative or other agreements 
for example  under our agreement with takeda for nesina  we may be responsible for royalty payments in japan up to  subject to a quarterly cap  for payments made by takeda to a licensor for patent s  if granted  in japan covering intellectual property related to nesina 
in addition  the recognition of clinical trial and other expenses that we otherwise would recognize over a period of time under applicable accounting principles might be accelerated or expanded in certain circumstances 
in such a case  it might cause our expenses during that period to be higher than they otherwise would have been had the circumstances not occurred 
for example  if we terminate a clinical trial for which we paid non refundable upfront fees to a clinical research organization and in which we did not accrue all of the patient costs  the recognition of the expense associated with those fees that we were recognizing as we accrued patient costs would be accelerated and recognized in the period in which the termination occurred 
we are dependent on the performance of service providers 
we rely on service providers  such as contract manufacturers  clinical research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators  including physician sponsors  to conduct nearly all of our clinical trials  including recruiting and enrolling patients in the trials 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a master development services agreement with ppd pursuant to which ppd provides us clinical development services at discounted rates on a preferred provider basis 
if ppd or any of these other parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might be delayed or may not obtain regulatory approval for or be able to commercialize our product candidates 
if any of the third parties upon whom we rely to conduct our clinical trials do not comply with applicable laws  successfully carry out their obligations or meet expected deadlines  our clinical trials might be extended  delayed or terminated 
if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data obtained by third party contractors is compromised due to their failure to adhere to applicable laws or our clinical protocols  or for other reasons  we might not obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our product candidates 
if our relationship with any of these organizations or individuals terminates  replacing any of these third parties could delay our clinical trials and could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
for example  we rely on our clinical research organizations computer programming and data management capabilities to run and support our clinical programs in such a manner to meet all necessary regulatory and compliance standards 
risks relating to our operations we might not successfully operate the compound partnering business as an independent entity 
it takes many years for a drug development business like ours to generate revenue and income 
although we have experience operating our compound partnering business within ppd s discovery sciences segment since  we might not be successful in operating this business as a stand alone company 
generating revenue and income  consistently or at all  from our drug development business and compound partnering activities depends on our ability to develop products internally or obtain rights to them from others on favorable terms  successfully complete non clinical and clinical studies  obtain clinical trial materials of sufficient quality or quantity  obtain and maintain intellectual property rights to these products  obtain and maintain regulatory approvals  enter into agreements with third parties to continue the development and commercialization of drug candidates  and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture products on our behalf and to provide sales and marketing functions 
we must attract and retain key employees in order to succeed 
to be successful  our unique business model requires that our personnel have extensive experience in designing and implementing drug development programs that will run faster than typical studies in the industry 
we also require qualified personnel  experienced at building and maintaining relationships with our collaborators 
we rely on the services of our senior management  particularly our president and chief medical officer  june almenoff  our senior vice president research  gail mcintyre  and our senior vice president clinical development and operations  paul covington  as well as our chief financial officer  marshall woodworth  our vice president legal affairs  nadine chien  and our vice president strategic development  sailash patel  the loss of any of whom could adversely impact our operations 
we do not carry key man insurance on any of these individuals or any of our other officers or employees 
any inability to hire additional qualified personnel might also require an increase in the workload for both existing and new personnel 
we might not be successful in attracting new scientists or management  or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel 
the shortage of experienced scientists and managers capable of working within our unique business model might lead to increased recruiting  relocation and compensation costs for these professionals  which might exceed our forecasts 
if we are unable to attract and retain any of these personnel  our ability to execute our business plan will be adversely affected 
if our product identification efforts are not successful  we might not be able to effectively develop new products 
our product candidates are in various stages of development 
some or all of our product candidates might never be developed for any number of reasons  including failure to meet clinical trial tests and failure to receive regulatory approval 
for example  we suspended our ppd program due to unfavorable efficacy data from the phase ii clinical trial 
to maintain our business  we need to have a sufficient pipeline of product candidates 
our success in identifying new product candidates depends upon our ability to identify and validate new targets through in licensing or collaborative arrangements 
in order to increase the possibilities of identifying compounds with a reasonable chance for success in clinical studies  part of our business strategy is to identify a higher number of potential targets than we expect to be able to progress through clinical development 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to identify or obtain rights to new product candidates that lead to the required regulatory approvals and the successful commercialization of products  our business could be harmed 
we or our collaborators might not be able to attract a sufficient number of sites or enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely manner in order to complete our clinical trials 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is significantly dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including changing regulatory requirements  the size of the patient population  perceived risks and benefits of the drug under study  availability of competing therapies  including those in clinical development  availability of clinical drug supply  participation of qualified clinical trial sites  availability and willingness of potential participants to enroll in clinical trials  design of the protocol  proximity of and access by patients to clinical sites  patient referral practices of physicians  eligibility criteria for the study in question  and efforts of the sponsor of and clinical sites involved in the trial to facilitate timely enrollment 
for example  patient enrollment for our phase ii proof of concept trial of jnj q in hospitalized pneumonia patients was slower than expected 
we might have difficulties obtaining sufficient patient enrollment or clinician support to conduct our clinical trials as planned  and we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to resources or delay or modify our plans significantly 
these considerations might result in our being unable to successfully achieve our projected development timelines  or potentially even lead us to consider the termination of on going clinical trials or development of a product for a particular indication 
many of our drug candidates are in development and we or our collaborators might not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
government approvals are required to develop  market and sell the potential drug candidates we develop alone or with others under our risk sharing arrangements 
especially for the early stage compounds we target for in licensing  obtaining government approval to develop  market and sell drug candidates is time consuming and expensive 
further  clinical trial results for a particular drug candidate might not satisfy requirements to obtain government approvals 
for example  in late  janssen  our collaborator at the time on dapoxetine  received a not approvable letter from the fda 
in addition  governmental approvals might not be received in a timely manner  if at all  and we and our collaborative partners might not be able to meet other regulatory requirements for our products 
in addition  governmental approvals might not be received in a timely manner  if at all  and we and our collaborative partners might not be able to meet other regulatory requirements for our products 
finally  even if we are successful in obtaining all required approvals to market and sell a drug candidate  post approval requirements and the failure to comply with other regulations could result in suspension or limitation of government approvals 
in connection with drug development activities outside the united states  we and our collaborators will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these requirements vary from country to country 
even if approval has been obtained for a product in the united states  approvals in foreign countries must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries 
the approval process in foreign countries could be more or less rigorous and the time required for approval might be longer or shorter than that required in the united states 
clinical studies conducted outside of any particular country might not be accepted by that country  and the approval of a pharmaceutical product in one country does not assure that the product will be approved in another country 
the failure to gain market acceptance of our product candidates among the medical community would adversely affect our future revenue 
even if approved  our product candidates might not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community 
we might not achieve market acceptance even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy and we obtain the necessary regulatory and reimbursement approvals 
the degree of market acceptance of any product candidates that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness of our product candidates versus competing products  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  pricing requirements in various markets  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and marketing and distribution support for our product candidates  including the efforts of our collaborators where they have marketing and distribution responsibilities 
physicians will not recommend our products until clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product as compared to conventional drug and other treatments 
even if we establish the clinical safety and efficacy of our product candidates  physicians might elect not to use our product for any number of other reasons  including whether the mode of administration of our products is effective for certain indications 
the failure of our product candidates to achieve significant market acceptance would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we might face additional regulation in the us if our drug candidate mudelta is classified as a controlled substance by the drug enforcement agency 
the drug enforcement agency  or dea  regulates drugs that are controlled substances 
controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the dea under the controlled substances act  or csa 
any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance  and scheduling by the dea is an independent process that might delay the commercial launch of a drug even after fda approval of the nda 
the csa governs  among other things  the inventory distribution  recordkeeping  handling  security and disposal of controlled substances 
mudelta is a novel  orally active  investigational agent in phase iii development  with combined mu opioid receptor agonist and delta opioid receptor antagonist activity 
because it likely acts on the central nervous system  mudelta has the potential to be scheduled as a controlled substance by the dea 
however  our animal and clinical studies indicate mudelta is not absorbed into the blood in an appreciable amount via an oral route of administration  thus limiting delivery to the central nervous system 
if the dea schedules mudelta as a controlled substance  we will be subject to periodic and on going inspections by the dea and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our on going compliance with the dea s regulations 
any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions  including the revocation  or a denial of renewal  of any dea registrations  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
additionally  if the dea schedules a drug because it is addictive  doctors might be reluctant to prescribe that drug 
it is possible that the dea will schedule mudelta as a controlled substance  and  based on the type of scheduling  doctors might not prescribe mudelta as frequently as they would otherwise  which could negatively impact our revenues 
we face significant competition 
we face significant competition  including from entities that have substantially greater resources and more experience in the commercialization and marketing of pharmaceuticals than we have 
potential competitors in the united states and other countries include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialized pharmaceutical companies 
these entities have developed and are developing compounds that might compete with our products in development 
these competitors might succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our product candidates or technologies or that would render any future commercialized products or technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
our product candidates and any future commercialized products might also face significant competition from both brand name and generic manufacturers that could adversely affect any future sales of our products 
any product that we or our collaborators succeed in developing and for which regulatory approval is obtained must then compete for market acceptance and market share 
the relative speed with which we and our collaborators can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market compared to competitive companies will affect market success 
in addition  the amount of marketing and sales resources and the effectiveness of the marketing used with respect to a product will affect its marketing success 
other factors affecting the ability of our products to compete include their efficacy and safety  the manner and frequency of their administration  and the extent of any reimbursement coverage 
in addition  some cro services providers and private equity funds are developing risk sharing models to finance the pharmaceutical industry s pipeline 
as these types of business models evolve  there will be increasing competition for compounds and funds to develop those compounds 
we must protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to succeed 
our success is dependent in part on our ability to develop and protect patent and other intellectual property rights and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of valid patents or the claim scope of our issued patents might not provide competitive advantages 
also  our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology that does not infringe our patent rights 
in addition  our patent for priligy is for method of use and not composition of matter 
further  patent applications are confidential for a period of time after filing 
we therefore might not know that a competitor has filed a patent application covering subject matter similar to subject matter in one of our patent applications or that we were the first to invent the innovation we seek to patent 
this might lead to disputes including interference proceeding or litigation to determine rights to patentable subject matter 
these disputes are often expensive and might result in our being unable to patent an innovation 
the scope  enforceability and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings 
no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents  so that even issued patents might later be modified or revoked by the relevant patent authorities or courts 
these proceedings could be expensive  last several years and either prevent issuance of additional patents to us or result in a significant reduction in the scope or invalidation of our patents 
any limitation in claim scope could reduce our ability to negotiate future collaborative research and development agreements based on these patents 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country  and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries  so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country 
although we might obtain patents for our intellectual property  third parties could challenge the patents before they expire 
further  the grant of a patent does not mean that the issued patent will necessarily be held valid and enforceable by a court 
if a governmental agency or court determines that a patent we hold is invalid  noninfringed or unenforceable  the patent will not provide us with market exclusivity  and third parties could therefore enter the market with competing products prior to the expiration of the patent 
in certain cases  we rely upon our collaborator to file  negotiate and maintain patents covering a licensed product 
our collaborators might fail to adequately obtain and maintain such patents 
in addition to seeking the protection of patents and licenses  we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  suppliers and licensees 
if these agreements are not honored  we might not have adequate remedies for any breach 
additionally  our trade secrets might otherwise become known or patented by our competitors 
we might need to obtain patent licenses from others in order to manufacture or sell our potential products and we might not be able to obtain these licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all 
other companies  universities and research institutions might obtain patents that could limit our ability to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our products or impair our competitive position 
as a result  we might need to obtain licenses from others before we could continue using  importing  manufacturing  marketing  or selling our products 
we might not be able to obtain required licenses on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain required licenses  we might encounter significant delays in product development while we redesign potentially infringing products or methods or we might not be able to market our products at all 
changes in the us and international healthcare industry  including reimbursement rates  could adversely affect the commercial value of our development product candidates 
the us and international healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may significantly affect the purchasing practices and pricing of pharmaceuticals 
the laws and regulations governing and issued by applicable regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations might be enacted  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
the us congress adopted healthcare reform and might adopt other legislation that could have the effect of putting downward pressure on the prices that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for prescription drugs 
cost containment measures  whether instituted by healthcare providers or imposed by government health administration regulators or new regulations  could result in greater selectivity in the purchase of drugs 
as a result  third party payors might challenge the price and cost effectiveness of our products 
in addition  in many major markets outside the united states  pricing approval is required before sales may commence 
as a result  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of approved healthcare products 
we might not be able to obtain or maintain our desired price for the products we develop 
any product we introduce might not be considered cost effective relative to alternative therapies 
as a result  adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to obtain or maintain prices sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
also  the trend towards managed healthcare in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs  might all result in lower prices  reduced reimbursement levels and diminished markets for our products 
these factors will also affect the products that are marketed by our collaborators and licensees 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that might arise from legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our future products and our business could suffer 
manufacturing changes might result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval or marketing for our products 
if we or our partners make changes in the manufacturing process for any of our products  we or our partners might be required to demonstrate to the applicable regulatory agencies that the changes have not caused the resulting drug material to differ significantly from the drug material previously produced 
further  any significant manufacturing changes for the production of our product candidates could result in delays in development or regulatory approval or in the reduction or interruption of commercial sales of our product candidates 
we or our partners contract manufacturers inability to maintain manufacturing operations in compliance with applicable regulations within our planned time and cost parameters could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made manufacturing changes and could make additional manufacturing changes for the production of our products currently in clinical development 
these manufacturing changes or an inability to immediately show comparability between the older material and the newer material after making manufacturing changes could result in delays in development or regulatory approvals or in reduction or interruption of commercial sales and could impair our competitive position 
our business might be harmed if we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials 
we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce our product candidates for use in clinical trials 
once a supplier s materials have been selected for use in the manufacturing process  the supplier in effect becomes a sole or limited source of that raw material due to regulatory compliance procedures 
if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these services with alternative suppliers  our ability to produce our products and to conduct preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates would be adversely affected 
this could impair our competitive position 
we must comply with extensive government regulations and laws 
we and our collaboration partners are subject to extensive regulation by federal government  state governments  and the foreign countries in which we conduct our business 
in particular  we are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation as a developer of drug candidates 
for example  the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  research  manufacture  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  quality control  adverse event reporting  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we must rely on our contract manufacturers and third party suppliers for regulatory compliance and adhering to the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements 
if these manufacturers or suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations  including fda pre or post approval inspections and cgmp requirements  then the fda could sanction us 
these sanctions could include fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delay  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  product seizures or recalls  operational restrictions or criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
if our operations are found to violate any applicable law or other governmental regulations  we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties  damages and fines 
similarly  if the hospitals  physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found non compliant with applicable laws  they might be subject to sanctions  which could also have a negative impact on us 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations  and additional legal or regulatory change 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 
we expend a significant amount of resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable and might adversely affect our operating results 
changing laws  regulations and standards might also create uncertainty and increase insurance costs 
we are committed to compliance and maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment might result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we might incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental regulations or to defend claims arising from accidents involving the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  handling and disposal of materials and wastes used in our operations 
as a result  we might be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages and incur liabilities  which exceed our resources 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of the adverse effect on our business or the financial and other costs that might result from any new government requirements arising out of future legislative  administrative or judicial actions 
we might be subject to product liability claims  and our insurance coverage and indemnification rights might not be adequate to cover these claims 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other types of claims in the event that the use of products during research and development efforts or after commercialization results in death  personal injury or other adverse effects 
pre clinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of our drug candidates to determine the safety and efficacy of potential products for use by humans following approval by regulatory authorities 
despite our efforts to determine the safety of our drug candidates in pre clinical studies and use of clinical study protocols approved by regulators  unanticipated negative side effects might become evident only when the drug candidates have been delivered to humans during clinical trials or used by patients in the marketplace 
this risk exists even with respect to any products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
while we will procure and maintain liability insurance with coverage up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate  and generally have indemnification rights under our collaboration agreements  our insurance might not be sufficient to satisfy any or all liabilities that may arise and our indemnification rights might not apply or be sufficient to cover such claims 
also  adequate insurance coverage might not be available in the future at acceptable cost  if at all 
our operations might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 
we depend on our collaboration partners  service providers and other facilities for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  pandemic flu  hurricanes and ice storms  could disrupt our operations or those of our collaboration partners  which could also affect us 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events  we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us  or our collaboration partners  could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial performance 
we  and the clinical research organizations who conduct our clinical trials  must protect electronic information and assets to succeed 
we rely on critical and sensitive data  such as personally identifiable patient information  trade secrets  intellectual property and corporate strategic plans 
security of this type of data is exposed to increasing external threats 
we  and our cros  are also subject to various standards for the protection of personally identifiable information 
failure to implement appropriate safeguards to adequately protect against any unauthorized or unintentional access  acquisition  use  modification  loss or disclosure of this critical or sensitive data may adversely affect our operations 
risks resulting from our spin off from ppd our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial position  future results of operations or future cash flows and does not reflect what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented 
our historical financial information included in this form k does not necessarily reflect what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone publicly traded company during the periods presented prior to june in addition  it is not necessarily indicative of our future financial position  future results of operations or future cash flows 
this is primarily a result of the following factors prior to our separation  our business was operated by ppd as part of its broader corporate organization and we did not operate as a stand alone company  most general administrative functions were performed by ppd for the combined entity  so although our historical combined financial statements reflect allocations of costs for services shared with ppd  these allocations may differ from the costs we will incur for these services as an independent company  after the completion of our separation  the cost of capital for our business might be higher than ppd s cost of capital prior to our separation  and prior to the separation  our financial statements include revenues and expenses of services that we did not continue subsequent to the separation 
we have a limited history operating as an independent company upon which you can evaluate us 
we have a limited operating history as a stand alone entity 
while our compound partnering business has constituted a part of the historic operations of ppd since  we have only operated as a stand alone company without the cro business since june following the spin off  as an independent company  our ability to satisfy our obligations and achieve profitability will be solely dependent upon the future performance of our compound partnering business  and we will not be able to rely upon the capital resources and cash flows of the cro business remaining with ppd 
we might have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with ppd 
the agreements we entered into with ppd in connection with the spin off  including the master development services agreement  the sublease  the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement  were negotiated while we were still part of ppd 
the terms of these agreements relate to  among other things  drug development services to be provided to us by ppd  the subleasing of our offices  employee benefit matters and the provision of transition services to us by ppd 
the master development services agreement requires us to use ppd for specified drug development services for three years contingent on ppd s expertise and capabilities to provide the needed services 
while we believe the terms and conditions of these agreements with ppd are reasonable and acceptable to us  they might not reflect the same terms and conditions that we could have obtained had we sought competitive bids from and negotiated with unaffiliated parties 
risks relating to our common stock various factors could negatively affect the market price or market of our common stock  which has traded publicly since june our stock has a limited trading history because we only became a separate public company in june  and our trading volume is lower than many companies  which could make investing in our stock riskier than more established companies 
in addition  market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue for the foreseeable future  so that investment in our securities involves substantial risk 
additionally  the stock market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following are some of the factors that might have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock developments or disputes as to patent or other proprietary rights  approval or introduction of competing products and technologies  results of clinical trials  failures or unexpected delays in timelines for our potential products in development  including the obtaining of regulatory approvals  delays in manufacturing or clinical trial plans  fluctuations in our operating results  market reaction to announcements by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  initiation  termination or modification of agreements with our collaborators or disputes or disagreements with collaborators  loss of key personnel  litigation or the threat of litigation  public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us  sales of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers  and comments and expectations of results made by securities analysts or investors 
if any of these factors causes us to fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  or if adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail with respect to our business  the price of our common stock would likely drop significantly 
a significant drop in the price of a company s common stock often leads to the filing of securities class action litigation against such a company 
this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
your percentage ownership in furiex might be diluted in the future 
your percentage ownership in furiex might be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors  officers and employees  as well as any future equity financing 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law might prevent or delay an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include  among others no right of our shareholders to act by written consent  procedures requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals or nominations for directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and no shareholder rights to call a special shareholders meeting 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer might be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders

results of operations our business consists solely of compound development and collaborative activities 
accordingly  we operate in one reportable business segment 
historically  our revenues consisted primarily of milestone and royalty payments from collaborators 
for the year ended december   our total revenue of million was comprised of royalty revenue from the sale of nesina  liovel and priligy by our collaborators 
for the year ended december   our total revenue of million consisted of million related to a regulatory milestone payment from takeda related to nesina  million of regulatory milestone payments from menarini related to priligy and million of royalty revenue from the sale of nesina  liovel and priligy by our collaborators 
we incurred research and development expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our research and development expenses include phase iii costs associated with the continued development of mudelta  a million development milestone payment to ranbaxy laboratories  ltd  or ranbaxy  in connection with the completion of the phase ii final study report for ppd and a million development milestone payment to janssen related to the dosing of the fifth patient in the on going phase iii trial for mudelta 
we expense all research and development costs for our drug candidates and external collaborations as incurred 
our forecasted total research and development expenses for the next months are expected to run between million and million  comprised almost entirely of phase iii study costs  manufacturing costs  non clinical costs and phase i study costs associated with mudelta 
we are actively exploring various partnering options with respect to mudelta 
any partnering arrangement we enter into could alter our forecasted research and development expenses for mudelta 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net loss of million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur net losses until revenues from all sources reach a level sufficient to support our on going operations 
our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors described in item a for information on these risks and uncertainties 
basis of accounting we have prepared the combined and consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and they include the accounts of furiex pharmaceuticals  inc and its subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the accompanying combined financial statements for periods prior to june   have been derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of ppd  and from the historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities of the various activities that reflect the combined results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the discovery sciences segment of ppd 
all the business components of the discovery sciences segment have been included in the historical statements because they were managed by common ppd segment management  and because they reflected historical performance of segment management 
in may  ppd discontinued operations of its wholly owned subsidiary ppd dermatology  inc  formerly magen biosciences  inc  due to unfavorable efficacy data associated with the mag program 
this business unit is recorded as discontinued operations in the statements of operations 
additionally  the discovery sciences segment included pre clinical consulting services not offered by us 
all rights and obligations related to pre clinical consulting services and the definitive purchase agreements related to ppd dermatology  inc have been retained by ppd 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  we were allocated expenses from ppd such as executive oversight  risk management  accounting  tax  legal  investor relations  human resources  information technology  facilities and depreciation  but were not allocated the underlying productive assets  such as information systems equipment  and furniture and facilities that were not assigned to us  but from which we benefited 
we reflected such expenses in the combined and consolidated financial statements as expense allocations from ppd 
the basis of these allocations included full time equivalent employees for the respective periods presented and square footage of occupied space 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the allocations 
management believes that the assumptions and allocations underlying the combined and consolidated financial statements are reasonable 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  the financial information in these combined and consolidated financial statements does not include all expenses that would have been incurred had we been a separate  stand alone publicly traded entity 
for periods prior to the june  spin off  the combined and consolidated financial statements include assets  liabilities and operations for ppd dermatology  inc and pre clinical consulting services that are not included in our operations after the spin off 
as a result  the financial information herein does not reflect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows had we been a separate  stand alone entity prior to june  year ended december  versus year ended december  the following table sets forth amounts from our combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  in thousands revenue milestones royalties total revenue research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating loss interest expense other income  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss revenue total revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from this increase was due to a million regulatory milestone payment from takeda with respect to the ema acceptance of the submission of a marketing authorization application for alogliptin in may  million of regulatory milestone payments from menarini upon the closing of the new license agreement related to priligy in july  an increase in royalty revenue related to the sale of nesina and liovel in japan and an increase in royalty revenue related to sales of priligy in various countries outside the united states 
expenses research and development  or r d  expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from the increase in r d expense was due predominantly to phase iii costs associated with the continued development of mudelta  a million development milestone payment to ranbaxy in connection with the completion of the phase ii final study report for ppd and a million development milestone payment to janssen related to the dosing of the fifth patient in the on going phase iii trial for mudelta  partially offset by decreases in spending for the discontinued ppd program and completion of the phase ii work related to mudelta and jnj q the following table sets forth amounts from our combined and consolidated statements of operations for r d expenses along with the dollar amount of the changes for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  inc dec in thousands r d expense by project mudelta jnj q ppd other r d expense total r d expense r d expenses will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons  including the number of compounds under development  the stages of development and changes in development plans 
in  we acquired the rights to the jnj q and mudelta compounds as a result of janssen decision not to exercise its option under the collaborative agreements for those compounds 
we are continuing to seek to partner or out license jnj q  with minimal expenditures forecasted in we are actively exploring partnering options for mudelta 
any partnering arrangement we enter into could alter our forecasted research and development expenses for mudelta 
our forecasted total research and development expenses for the next months are expected to run between million and million  comprised almost entirely of phase iii study costs  manufacturing costs  non clinical costs and phase i study costs associated with mudelta 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from the increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increases in non cash stock compensation expense of million  including additional grants issued to employees during and the mark to market adjustment for non vested consultant options  and increases in consulting and legal expenses of million

income taxes during and  we did not record a tax benefit related to our operating losses because we have provided full valuation allowances against our assets based on our history of operating losses 
we anticipate that we will require a full valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets until such time as we are able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of profitability 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an insignificant amount of income tax expense 
this amount relates to the adjustment of a deferred tax liability associated with historical goodwill  which we amortize and deduct for tax purposes  but treat as an indefinite lived intangible asset for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations net loss of million for the year ended december  represents a million decrease from net loss of million during this decrease in our net loss resulted primarily from the million increase in revenue  partially offset by the million increase in r d expenses  a million increase in sg a expenses and the million increase in interest expense  as described above

for the year ended december   we received royalties of million from sales of priligy in various countries outside the united states  and from the sale of nesina and liovel in japan 
expenses r d expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from the decrease in r d expense was due predominantly to reduced development costs for the mudelta and jnj q compounds  offset by increased spending related to the ppd compound 
as of december   we had substantially completed the phase ii clinical trials for the mudelta and jnj q compounds

as a result  janssen elected not to exercise its option to continue the development of the jnj q compound 
on april   we announced that we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the jnj q compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
on november   we announced we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the mudelta compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen s decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of mudelta 
in december  we announced top line results from the phase ii trial of ppd based on these results  we have discontinued further spending on the ppd program and have terminated the license agreement with ranbaxy in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
r d expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period for a variety of reasons  including the number of compounds under development  the stages of development and changes in development plans 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses  increased million to million for the year ended december  from the increase in sg a expenses was due primarily to increases in non cash stock compensation expense 
income taxes during and  we did not record a tax benefit related to our operating losses because we have provided full valuation allowances against our assets based on our history of operating losses 
additionally  with the exception of the pre acquisition federal and state tax filings for magen biosciences  inc and certain separate state filings  through the june  spin off  our operations were included in the consolidated federal and combined state tax returns of ppd  and the resulting tax attributes have been fully utilized by ppd and are no longer available to us for future use 
subsequent to june   we have filed federal and state returns separately from ppd and can use our tax attributes accordingly 
however  we anticipate that we will require a full valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets until such time as we are able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of profitability 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded an insignificant amount of income tax expense 
this amount relates to the adjustment of a deferred tax liability associated with historical goodwill  which is amortized and deductible for tax purposes  but is an indefinite lived intangible asset for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations net loss of million in represents a million decrease from net loss of million in this decrease in net loss resulted primarily from discontinued operations  in addition to changes in revenue and r d expenses  as described above 
in may  ppd discontinued operations of its wholly owned subsidiary ppd dermatology  inc due to unfavorable efficacy data associated with the mag program 
as a result  this business unit is shown as discontinued operations for loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million of accounts receivable and million of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
included in the year end accrued expense balance is million owed to janssen associated with priligy transition services 
the primary source of our current cash  cash equivalents and investments is related to upfront  milestone and royalty payments received since the spin off from ppd and cash from the issuance of debt 
on august   we entered into a loan agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank 
this initial borrowing in the amount of million had a fixed interest rate of per annum and was initially due august  on august   we entered into an amended loan agreement with midcap funding iii  llc  midcap funding re holdings  llc and silicon valley bank for an additional million 
this new agreement amended the prior agreement by resetting the maturity date to august  for a total amount of million  bearing interest at a fixed rate of  subject to adjustment under specified conditions 
interest accrues daily and is payable on the first day of the following month  in arrears 
principal payments are due on a ratable monthly basis from august  until maturity 
as part of this amended agreement  we are required to maintain a cash balance with silicon valley bank in an amount of not less than million through august   million through august  and million through august  as of december   this amount is presented in investments within the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we must maintain our primary deposit and investment accounts with silicon valley bank  consisting of at least of our total cash  cash equivalents and investments balance 
we have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since the spin off and will continue to incur operating losses until revenues from all sources reach a level sufficient to support our on going operations 
our long term liquidity needs will largely be determined by the success of our products already being commercialized by collaborators  key development and regulatory events that might impact our ability to out license our development compounds and expenses associated with research and development efforts 
based on current forecasts  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue our planned operations for at least the next months 
however  if one or more of our forecasted milestone events and or the expected growth in royalty payments fails to meet our expectations  or if research and development expenses increase because of slower than expected enrollment rates or other factors  we will likely need to find additional sources of financing to support our phase iii development efforts for mudelta 
depending upon the success and timing of receipt of various milestone payments and royalties  it might be necessary to do one or more of the following in the next months a raise additional capital  b reduce spending on research and development  or c restructure our operations 
on an on going basis we evaluate our financial position with respect to current and future financing activities 
the financing activities could take the form of additional debt or equity as dictated by our needs and our view toward our overall capital structure 
we currently expect that additional funding  if necessary or desired  would come from potential sources including  but not limited to  partnering income  royalty financing  and debt and or equity issuances 
while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next months based on our current operating projections  our liquidity over that time period could be affected by  among other things costs related to our development efforts  regulatory approval and commercialization of our compound candidates which could affect milestone and royalty receipts  changes in regulatory compliance requirements  reliance on existing collaborators and the potential need to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other financing alternatives  or other factors described under item a 
risk factors 
the timing and amount of any future expenses  trial completion dates and revenues related to our compounds are subject to significant uncertainty 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any of our drug candidates 
the timing and amount of our research and development expenses will depend upon the costs associated with the present and potential future clinical trials and non clinical studies of our drug candidates  any related expansion of our research and development organization  changes in regulatory requirements and manufacturing costs 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of events arising during clinical development 
for example  if the fda  or another regulatory authority  were to require us or one of our collaborators to conduct clinical trials beyond those we currently anticipate to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
the timing and amount of revenues  if any  are dependent upon the success of the clinical trials as well as the commercial success of these products in the marketplace  all of which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
our future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  among others the cost and expense of continuing the research and development activities of our existing candidates  new collaborative agreements that we might enter into in the future  progress of compound candidates in clinical trials as it relates to the cost of development and the receipt of future milestone payments  if any  the ability of our licensees and collaborators to obtain regulatory approval and successfully manufacture and market collaboration products  the continued or additional support by our collaborators or other third parties of research and development efforts and clinical trials  time required to gain regulatory approvals  the demand for our potential products  if and when approved  potential acquisitions of technology  product candidates or businesses by us  and the costs of defending or prosecuting any patent opposition or litigation necessary to protect our proprietary technologies 
in order to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our potential product candidates we might raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or from other sources  collaborative arrangements  the use of sponsored research efforts or other means 
however  additional financing might not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and such financing might only be available on terms dilutive or otherwise detrimental to our stockholders or our business 
for the year ended december   our operating activities used million in cash as compared to million used for the same period in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities of million was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities  an increase in revenue of million and an increase in r d expense of million from for the year ended december   our investing activities provided million in cash as compared to million of cash used for the same period in the change in our investing activities from the prior year was due primarily to the purchase and sale of investments 
for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million in cash due primarily to the loan agreement with midcap funding iii  llc  midcap funding re holdings  llc and silicon valley bank for million and million from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises by consultants  partially offset by additions to deferred financing costs of million 
for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million in cash under the previous loan agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank and million from the issuance of common stock related to option exercises by employees and consultants 
contractual obligations on august   we entered into a loan and security agreement the agreement with midcap funding iii  llc and silicon valley bank 
this initial borrowing in the amount of million had a fixed interest rate of per annum and was initially due august  interest accrued monthly and was payable on the first day of the following month  in arrears 
principal payments of the initial borrowing were to be paid on a ratable monthly basis from august  until maturity 
however  on august   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended agreement with midcap funding iii  llc  midcap funding re holdings  llc and silicon valley bank  or collectively  the lenders 
the amended agreement modified the prior agreement by providing an additional million in borrowings and reset the maturity date of the initial agreement to august  under the terms of the amended agreement  the total amount due to the lenders of million has a maturity date of august  the amended agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of  subject to adjustment under specified conditions 
interest accrues daily and is payable on the first day of the following month  in arrears 
principal payments are due on a ratable monthly basis from august  until maturity 
as part of this new agreement  we are required to maintain a cash balance with silicon valley bank in an amount of not less than million through august   million through august  and million through august  in addition  we must maintain our primary deposit and investment accounts with silicon valley bank  consisting of at least of our total cash  cash equivalents and investments balance 
under the initial agreement we were required to maintain a cash balance with silicon valley bank in an amount of not less than million until mid january we intend to use the proceeds from the loan to support research and development for our mudelta compound 
a final payment fee is due to the lenders in an amount equal to of the total loan commitment  payable at the maturity date or earlier prepayment of the loan 
we may prepay the loan subject to a prepayment fee of between one and four percent of the amount borrowed  depending on the time of the prepayment 
the amount of interest expense related to the initial agreement and amended agreement included in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
included in these amounts are the ratable accrual of the final payment fee and the amortization of deferred financing costs over the term of the loan  which are included in other long term liabilities and other assets within the consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
under the amended agreement  we are subject to affirmative covenants  including the obligations to maintain good standing  provide certain notices to the lenders  deliver financial statements to the lenders  maintain insurance  discharge all taxes  protect intellectual property and protect collateral 
we are also subject to negative covenants  including that we may not enter into a merger or consolidation or certain change of control events  incur liens on the collateral  incur additional indebtedness  dispose of any property  change our jurisdictions of organization or organizational structures or types  declare or pay dividends other than dividends payable solely in common stock  make certain investments or acquisitions  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates  in each case subject to certain customary exceptions  including exceptions that allow us to acquire additional compounds and to enter into licenses and similar agreements providing for the use and collaboration of our intellectual property provided certain conditions are met 
our assets serve as collateral for the loan 
the amended agreement provides that events of default include failure to make payment of principal or interest on the loan when required  failure to perform certain obligations under the amended agreement and related documents  defaults in certain other indebtedness and certain other events including certain adverse actions taken by the fda or other governmental authorities 
upon events of default  our obligations under the amended agreement may  or in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy  will automatically be accelerated 
upon the occurrence of any event of default  our obligations under the amended agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of a above the rate of interest applicable to such obligations immediately prior to the occurrence of the event of default or b the maximum rate allowable under law 
as of december   future minimum payments on all of our contractual obligations for fiscal years ended subsequent to december  were as follows related to our amended loan and security agreement  priligy transition service payments owed janssen and operating leases in morrisville  north carolina and wilmington  north carolina years ended december in thousands total long term debt principal long term debt interest and fees janssen transition service payments operating leases total contractual obligations as of december   we were contingently obligated under collaboration agreements that have not been included in the table above due to the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and timing of payments 
as of december   we had two collaborations that involve potential future expenditures 
the first is our collaboration with alza and janssen for priligy 
on may   we entered into a license and asset transfer agreement with alza and janssen  whereby alza and janssen transferred to us worldwide rights for priligy 
to facilitate a uniform transition  janssen will continue to manufacture and manage certain clinical and regulatory activities with respect to priligy for a pre defined period after the closing date of the agreement 
this transaction became effective on july  under the terms of this transaction  we are obligated to pay janssen for transition services provided to us in the amount of million  with million paid within days of closing  and million due within business days of the beginning of each of the following two calendar quarters 
in addition  we are obligated to pay janssen up to million in potential on going clinical study costs and up to million for reasonable out of pocket expenses over the transition period 
we must also pay janssen fees related to priligy sales and distribution activities that janssen will perform for us during the transition period pursuant to a sales services agreement 
we believe the transition period will be completed within months from the contract date 
priligy will continue to be made available to patients under the sales service agreement until the marketing authorizations are transferred  at which time commercialization of the product will transition to us or our licensee 
the term of the license and asset transfer agreement will expire on the latest of the completion of the transition of the product rights to us  the expiration of our last payment obligation to janssen  or the expiration of the last to expire ancillary agreement 
our collaboration with alza and janssen for priligy  as described above  is associated with an out license agreement under which we did receive  and are eligible to receive  additional payments 
on may   we entered into a license agreement with menarini by which we will license to menarini exclusive rights to commercialize priligy in europe  most of asia  africa  latin america and the middle east 
this transaction became effective on july  we will retain full development and commercialization rights in the united states  japan and canada 
menarini will assume responsibility for commercialization activities in the licensed territories and will fund the on going clinical studies being performed by janssen 
under the license agreement with menarini  we received a million upfront payment and million of regulatory milestone payments during the third quarter of  and are eligible to receive up to million to fund potential costs of on going clinical studies being performed by janssen  up to million in launch based milestones and up to million in sales based milestones  plus tiered royalties ranging from the mid teens to mid twenties in percentage terms 
during the third quarter of  we recognized milestone revenue of million related to this agreement related to regulatory submissions 
the million upfront payment received during the third quarter of was not recorded as milestone revenue  nor will the potential up to million for on going clinical study costs  based on the terms of the agreement described below 
the term of the license agreement and the period during which menarini must pay us royalties in a particular country for a particular product will end  on a country by country basis  upon the latest of i the expiration of a valid relevant patent claim in that country  ii the expiration of marketing and data exclusivity in that country  or iii the market entry of an approved product in that country containing dapoxetine for use  on an as needed basis  for premature ejaculation 
in connection with the license and asset transfer agreement with alza and janssen  and the license agreement with menarini  we have assessed the indicators associated with agent and principal considerations for each transaction 
based on the terms of the underlying agreements  the nature of the related cash payments and receipts regarding the million up front and transition service payments  the up to million to fund potential on going clinical study costs and the fees related to priligy sales and distribution activities performed by janssen  and the determination that we are not the primary obligor for the underlying activities that are associated with these payments  we have recorded these amounts on a net basis within the combined and consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we have paid amounts to janssen  and correspondingly received equal payments from menarini  totaling million related to on going clinical study costs for priligy 
in addition  we have paid to janssen approximately million in fees associated with sales and distribution activities for priligy during the transition period 
we have also considered the contractual right of offset related to these payments  for which we are effectively an intermediary  and have recorded these amounts on a gross basis within the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the remaining amounts due to janssen associated with priligy transition services of million are reflected in accrued expenses 
as of december   approximately million is reflected in both accounts receivable and accrued expenses related to the on going priligy clinical study costs being performed by janssen 
we originally acquired patents for priligy from eli lilly and company  or lilly  and are obligated to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales in excess of million 
in addition  under the terms of the license agreement with menarini  we remain responsible for payment of royalties to lilly  except menarini will pay the portion of the royalties owed to lilly in each country where menarini is licensed to sell priligy  where lilly is eligible for payments  and where we are no longer eligible for payments from menarini 
the term of the license agreement with lilly and the period during which we or menarini must pay lilly royalties in a particular country will end  on a country by country basis  upon the later of i the last to expire valid patent claim licensed to lilly in that country  ii the expiration of data exclusivity in that country  or iii the tenth anniversary of the first date of sale of priligy in that country 
the second collaboration involving future expenditures is associated with the two compounds in licensed from janssen jnj q and mudelta 
on april   janssen announced that in connection with a broad strategic review of its portfolio of infectious disease programs  it will be redirecting its research and development efforts toward antivirals and vaccines  and will not be investing in the development of new antibacterial therapies 
as a result  janssen elected not to exercise its option to continue the development of the jnj q compound 
on april   we announced that we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the jnj q compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
on november   we announced that we had acquired full exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize the mudelta compound under our existing development and license agreement with janssen 
we acquired these rights as a result of janssen decision not to exercise its option under the agreement to continue development of mudelta 
we plan to continue evaluating other partnering and funding opportunities for both the jnj q and mudelta compounds 
we may be obligated to pay janssen up to million in regulatory milestone payments for the jnj q compound  up to million in regulatory milestone payments for the mudelta compound  and  if approved for marketing  for both the jnj q and mudelta compounds  individually  up to million in sales based milestone payments and sales based royalties increasing from the mid to upper single digit percentages as sales volume increases 
royalties would be paid for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale or  if later  the expiration of the last valid patent claim or the expiration of patent exclusivity 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our combined and consolidated financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenue in the form of upfront payments  development and regulatory milestone payments  royalties  and launch based and sales based milestone payments in connection with the out license or sale of compounds 
the receipt of future milestone payments and royalties depends on the success of our compound development and our collaborators success in developing and commercializing compounds 
upfront payments are generally paid within a short period of time following the execution of an out license or collaboration agreement 
development and regulatory milestone payments are typically one time payments to us triggered by the collaborator achievement of specified development and regulatory events such as the commencement of phase iii trials or regulatory submission approval 
royalties are payments received by us based on net product sales of a collaborator 
launch based milestone payments are one time payments to us triggered when a collaborator first introduces for sale an out licensed product in a new geographical region 
sales based milestone payments are typically one time payments to us triggered when aggregate net sales of product by a collaborator for a specified period for example  an annual period reach an agreed upon threshold amount 
we recognize upfront payments  development and regulatory milestone payments  royalty payments  and launch based and sales based milestone payments from our collaborators when the event that triggers the obligation of payment has occurred  there is no further obligation on our part in connection with the payment and collection is reasonably assured 
we assess each collaboration agreement we enter into for potential indicators associated with agent and principal considerations for each related cash payment and receipt 
based on the terms of the underlying agreement and the determination of which party to the transaction is the primary obligor  we record the underlying activities that are associated with contractual payments within the combined and consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets on a net or gross basis  accordingly 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually on october and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing the annual impairment test  the fair value of the company was determined using a combination of the income and market approaches 
we have a single reporting unit 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
the market approach considers recent comparable transactional valuation multiples for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
for the income approach  we made assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  probability of future compound development and appropriate discount rates 
the compound development estimates are highly subjective due to the uncertainty associated with the amounts and timing of expected milestone and royalty payments 
we base the amount and timing of future cash flows within our analysis on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
actual results may differ from those we assume in our forecasts  which could have a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements 
we use estimates of market participant weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our future expected cash flows  adjusted for the risks and uncertainty inherent in our industry generally and in our internally developed forecasts 
based on our review as of october   our calculated fair value of equity was in excess of carrying value by a substantial margin 
the fair value of goodwill could be materially impacted by future adverse changes such as future declines in operating results  a decline in the valuation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks  including the valuation of the company own common stock  a slowdown in the worldwide economy or the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  failure to meet the performance projections included in forecasted operating results  or the delay or abandonment of any research and development programs 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method related to stock options and other share based compensation 
we measure the expense based on the grant date fair value of the awards that are expected to vest and record the expense over the applicable requisite service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  we base the fair value upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price based on peer companies  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
tax valuation allowances we calculated our income tax provision for the periods prior to june  using the separate return basis as if we had filed separate income tax returns under our existing structure 
we determined the provision for income taxes subsequent to the spin off using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the year  plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which we expect those tax attributes to be recovered or paid  and adjust these measurements for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment  including the long range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made 
due to the historical losses from our operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued an update to the accounting standard that permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit fair value is  more likely than not  greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning january  our adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements as we used the quantitative two step goodwill impairment model as of the october  annual impairment test 
income taxes except for the pre acquisition federal and state tax filings for magen biosciences  inc and certain separate state filings through the june  spin off  our operations prior to june  have been included in the consolidated federal and combined state tax returns of ppd 
as such  except for the pre acquisition tax attributes of magen biosciences  inc  and some losses from certain separate filing states  the tax attributes of our operations prior to june  have been utilized or paid by ppd 
thus  the tax attributes which have been included in ppd s combined returns have not been accounted for in the results of our operations 
subsequent to june   we have filed federal and state returns separately from ppd and can use our tax attributes accordingly 
potential volatility of annual operating results our annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include the success of achieving milestones and the timing of our milestone payments or other revenue  if any  our dependence on a small number of compounds and collaborations  the success or failure of clinical trials and other aspects of developing and commercializing our product candidates  our ability to properly manage our growth  the timing and amount of costs associated with research and development and compound partnering collaborations  our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel  the timing and extent of new government regulations  and intellectual property risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our current investment policies  we invest our cash  cash equivalents and investments in money market funds that invest in short term us treasury securities with insignificant rates of return 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
under our amended and restated loan and security agreement with midcap funding iii  llc  midcap funding re holdings  llc and silicon valley bank  we have million of outstanding debt due august  this debt bears interest at a fixed rate of  subject to adjustment under specified conditions unrelated to current market interest rates 
due to the fixed rate associated with this outstanding debt  an increase in market rates would have no impact on our future obligations as of december  the net sales associated with nesina and related combination products and priligy that generate our current stream of royalty payments are denominated in the respective foreign currency of the underlying location of the sale of the respective product 
the fluctuations of foreign currencies with respect to the us dollar have historically been insignificant and have not exposed us to material risk 
however  this exposure could become material in future periods based upon fluctuations in currency rates 
our purchases of raw materials and finished goods are denominated primarily in us dollars  purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant 
additionally  our net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant and have not historically exposed us to material risk associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
given these facts  we have not yet considered it necessary to use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates 
however  we continually evaluate the potential need to do so and may use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes in the future
