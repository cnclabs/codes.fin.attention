description of business yum is the world s largest quick service restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over  restaurants in more than countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc  pizza hut or taco bell brands 
in december of we sold our long john silver ljs and a w all american food restaurants a w brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions 
the results for these businesses through the sale dates are included in the company results for and the company s primary restaurant brands kfc  pizza hut and taco bell are the global leaders in the chicken  pizza and mexican style food categories  respectively 
of the over  restaurants  are operated by the company  are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and are operated by licensees 
yum s business consists of four reporting segments yum china china or china division  yum restaurants international yri or international division  united states us and yum restaurants india india or india division 
the china division includes mainland china and the india division includes india  bangladesh  mauritius  nepal and sri lanka 
yri includes the remainder of our international operations 
the china division  yri and taco bell us now represent approximately of the company s operating profits  excluding corporate and unallocated income and expenses 
in  our india division began being reported as a standalone reporting segment separate from yri as a result of changes to our management reporting structure 
while our consolidated results are not impacted  our historical segment information has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation 
strategies the company continues to focus on four key strategies build leading brands in china in every significant category the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurant brands  respectively  in mainland china 
additionally  the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage 
given this strong competitive position  a growing economy and a population of billion in mainland china  the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food 
additionally  on february  we acquired an additional interest in little sheep group ltd 
little sheep  a leading casual dining concept in china 
this acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately of the business 
our ongoing earnings growth model in china includes double digit percentage unit growth  mid teen system sales growth  mid single digit same store sales growth and moderate leverage of our general and administrative g a infrastructure  which we expect to drive operating profit growth of drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere outside the us and china the company and its franchisees opened over  new restaurants in  representing straight years of opening over restaurants  and the company is one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened 
the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india  france  germany  russia and across africa 
the international division s operating profit has experienced a year compound annual growth rate of 
our ongoing earnings growth model for yri includes operating profit growth of driven by unit growth  system sales growth of  at least same store sales growth  margin improvement and leverage of our g a infrastructure 
dramatically improve us brand positions  consistency and returns the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience 
the company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts 
we continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on company owned restaurants 
our ongoing earnings growth model for the us calls for operating profit growth of driven by same store sales growth of at least  margin improvement and leverage of our g a infrastructure 
drive industry leading  long term shareholder and franchisee value the company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases 
the company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the quick service restaurants qsr industry 
the company s dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over billion and billion to shareholders  respectively  since the company targets an annual dividend payout ratio of to of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend at a double digit percentage rate each year since first initiating a dividend in shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 
the ongoing earnings growth rates referenced above represent our average annual targets for the next several years 
consistent with these ongoing earnings growth rates  in december we indicated our expectation of at least eps growth for however  kfc china same store sales turned sharply negative during the last two weeks in december as a result of adverse publicity from a poultry supply situation 
we have made the assumptions that it will take time to restore consumer confidence and kfc china same store sales will improve as the year progresses and will be positive in the fourth quarter 
with these assumptions  for the full year  we estimate that china restaurant margin will be in the mid teens  china operating profit will be negative versus prior year and eps  excluding special items  will decline by a mid single digit percentage in this includes an expectation for a significant decline in eps performance in the first half of the year followed by eps growth in the second half 
we expect to open at least new units in china  which is unchanged from our previous guidance

us business transformation we took several measures in  and to transform our us business including refranchising and g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs 
in the year ended december   we recorded pre tax refranchising gains of million in the us  primarily due to gains on sales of taco bells 
in the years ended december  and december   we recorded pre tax losses of million and million from refranchising in the us  respectively 
the losses recorded in the years ended december  and december  were primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the us  principally a substantial portion of our company operated kfc restaurants 
the non cash impairment charges that we recorded related to our offers to refranchise these company operated kfc restaurants in the us decreased depreciation expense versus what we would have otherwise recorded by million  million and million in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
this depreciation reduction was recorded as a special item  resulting in depreciation expense in the us segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants 
this depreciation reduction is classified within other special items income expense in the table above 
refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in note and the store portfolio strategy section of the md a 
in connection with our g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  we recorded pre tax charges of million  million and million in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
these charges are classified within other special items in the above table 
yum retirement plan settlement charge during the fourth quarter of  the company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in the yum retirement plan the plan an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits 
we paid out million  all of which was funded from existing pension plan assets 
as a result of settlement payments exceeding the sum of service and interest costs within the plan in  pursuant to our policy  we recorded a pre tax settlement charge of million in general and administrative expenses 
see note for further discussion of our pension plans 
little sheep acquisition on february  we acquired an additional interest in little sheep for million  net of cash acquired of million  increasing our ownership to 
the acquisition was driven by our strategy to build leading brands across china in every significant category 
prior to our acquisition of this additional interest  our interest in little sheep was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of the acquisition we obtained voting control of little sheep  and thus we began consolidating little sheep upon acquisition 
as required by gaap  we remeasured our previously held ownership in the entity  which had a recorded value of million at the date of acquisition  at fair value based on little sheep traded share price immediately prior to our offer and recognized a non cash gain of million  which resulted in no related income tax expense 
under the equity method of accounting  we previously reported our share of the net income of little sheep as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
since the acquisition  we have reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer report other income expense as we did under the equity method of accounting 
net income attributable to our partner ownership percentage is recorded as net income noncontrolling interest 
in  the consolidation of little sheep increased china division revenues by  decreased china division restaurant margin by percentage points and did not have a significant impact on china division operating profit 
refranchising of equity markets outside the us during the fourth quarter of  we refranchised our remaining company owned pizza hut dine in restaurants in the united kingdom 
the newly signed franchise agreement for these stores allows the franchisee to pay continuing franchise fees in the initial years of the agreement at a reduced rate 
we agreed to allow the franchisee to pay these reduced fees in part as consideration for their assumption of lease liabilities related to underperforming stores that we anticipate they will close that were part of the refranchising 
we recognize the estimated value of terms in franchise agreements entered into concurrently with a refranchising transaction that are not consistent with market terms as part of the upfront refranchising gain loss 
accordingly  upon the closing of this refranchising we recognized a loss of million representing the estimated value of these reduced continuing fees 
the associated deferred credit is recorded within other liabilities and deferred credits in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and will be amortized into yri franchise and license fees and income over the next four years  including million in this upfront loss largely contributed to a million refranchising loss we recognized in special items during as a result of this refranchising 
also included in that loss was the write off of million in goodwill allocated to the pizza hut uk reporting unit 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill allocated to our pizza hut uk business of million  after the aforementioned write off  was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the pizza hut uk reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded in special items in as a result of this million refranchising loss 
during  we recorded a million charge in refranchising gain loss as a result of our decision to refranchise or close all of our remaining company owned pizza hut uk dine in restaurants  primarily to write down these restaurants long lived assets to their then estimated fair value 
impairment charges of pizza hut uk long lived assets incurred as a result of this decision  including the charge mentioned in the previous sentence  reduced depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the depreciation reduction is classified within other special items income expense in the table above 
in  we recorded a million loss on the refranchising of our mexico equity market as we sold all of our company owned restaurants  comprised of kfc and pizza huts  to an existing latin american franchise partner 
the buyer is also serving as the master franchisee for mexico which had kfc and pizza hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction 
the write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill 
this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit 
in  within other special items income expense  we recorded gains of million from real estate sales related to our previously refranchised business 
in  we refranchised all of our remaining company owned restaurants in taiwan  which consisted of kfcs 
we included in our december  financial statements a write off of million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of taiwan 
this loss did not result in a related income tax benefit 
we believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the taiwan refranchising were substantially consistent with market 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our taiwan business of million  was determined not to be impaired subsequent to the refranchising as the fair value of the taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
the amount of goodwill write off for the pizza hut uk and taiwan reporting units was based on the relative fair values of the businesses disposed of and the portion of the businesses that were retained 
the fair value of the businesses disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee  which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the company associated with the franchise agreements entered into in connection with these refranchising transactions 
the fair value retained by the company includes future royalties to be received from the refranchised businesses 
for pizza hut uk  the fair value retained also includes the anticipated future cash flows from our pizza hut uk delivery business  which is part of the pizza hut uk reporting unit  and was not impacted by the dine in refranchising 
ljs and a w divestitures in  we sold the long john silver and a w all american food restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions 
in  we recognized million of pre tax losses and other costs primarily in closures and impairment income expenses as a result of our decision to sell these businesses 
additionally  we recognized million of tax benefits related to these divestitures 
in  system sales and franchise and license fees and income in the us were negatively impacted by and  respectively  due to these divestitures while yri system sales and franchise and license fees and income were both negatively impacted by 
while these divestitures negatively impacted both the us and yri segments operating profit by in  the impact on our consolidated operating profit was not significant 
china results of operations china division same store sales declined in the fourth quarter of kfc china sales in the last two weeks of the year were significantly impacted by the intense media attention surrounding an investigation by the shanghai fda sfda into poultry supply management at our china division 
the investigation was prompted by a report broadcast on china national television  which showed that a few poultry farmers were ignoring laws and regulations by using excessive levels of antibiotics in chicken 
some of this chicken was purchased by two poultry suppliers of kfc china 
on january   the sfda concluded its investigation and released its recommendations to yum china to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices including refined voluntary self testing procedures  improved reporting and communications and enhanced supplier management 
our team in china has taken a comprehensive review of our current system and is in the process of incorporating all of the sfda recommendations 
january estimated same store sales declined for the china division  including a decline at kfc china 
we estimate that the timing of chinese new year had a negative mid teen impact on the china division january same store sales growth and we expect the negative impact of chinese new year to reverse in february resulting in a decline of approximately for january and february combined china first quarter 
see the strategies section of this md a for a discussion of the expected impact of this situation on china division results of operations for the full year and on yum eps growth 
extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a rd week every five or six years 
fiscal year included a rd week in the fourth quarter for all our us businesses and certain of our yri businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
our china and india divisions report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a rd week in see the system sales growth section within our md a for further discussion on the impact of rd week in on system sales 
the following table summarizes the estimated impact of the rd week in on revenues and operating profit us yri unallocated total revenues company sales franchise and license fees total revenues operating profit franchise and license fees restaurant profit general and administrative expenses operating profit a a the million benefit was offset throughout by investments  including franchise development incentives  as well as higher than normal spending  such as restaurant closures in the us and yri 
yri acquisitions in  yri acquired kfc restaurants from an existing franchisee in south africa for million 
in  we completed the exercise of our option with our russian partner to purchase their interest in the co branded rostik s kfc restaurants across russia and the commonwealth of independent states 
as a result  we acquired company ownership of restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of restaurants  which our partner previously managed as master franchisee 
we paid cash of million  net of settlement of a long term note receivable of million  and assumed long term debt of million which was subsequently repaid 
of the remaining balance of the purchase price of million  a payment of million was made in july and the remainder is expected to be paid in cash during the impact of consolidating these businesses on all line items within our consolidated statement of income was insignificant to the comparison of our year over year results and is not expected to materially impact our results going forward 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell restaurants of about  down from its current level of  with our primary remaining focus being refranchising at taco bell to about company ownership from its current level of 
consistent with this strategy   and company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
additionally  in december we refranchised remaining company owned dine in restaurants in the pizza hut uk business and during  we refranchised all company owned kfcs and pizza huts in mexico restaurants and kfcs in taiwan restaurants 
the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising gain loss  pre tax refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline and franchise and license expense can increase over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of g a declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit and g a expenses and b the increase in franchise fees and expenses from the restaurants that have been refranchised 
the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
in these tables  decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of company sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year 
increased franchise and license fees and income represents the franchise and license fees and rent income from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year 
increased franchise and license expenses represent primarily rent and depreciation where we continue to own or lease the underlying property for the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year 
the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on total revenues as described above china yri us india worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues china yri us india worldwide decreased company sales increased franchise and license fees and income decrease in total revenues the following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on operating profit as described above china yri us india worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income increased franchise and license expenses decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit china yri us india worldwide decreased restaurant profit increased franchise and license fees and income increased franchise and license expenses decreased g a increase decrease in operating profit internal revenue service proposed adjustments on june   the company received a revenue agent report rar from the internal revenue service the irs relating to its examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years through the irs has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the us that yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
the proposed adjustment would result in approximately million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately million for fiscal years on january   the company received an rar from the irs for fiscal years and as expected  the irs proposed an adjustment similar to their proposal for that would result in approximately million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately million for fiscal years and furthermore  the company expects the irs to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal the potential additional taxes for through  computed on a similar basis to the additional taxes  would be approximately million plus net interest to date of approximately million 
we believe that the company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustments are inconsistent with applicable income tax laws  treasury regulations and relevant case law 
we intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the irs 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain  the company will continue to provide for its position in accordance with gaap 
there can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material  adverse effect on our financial position 
additionally  if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue  such increases could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded 
the company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution 
china value added tax regulation a tax regulation was issued in november in china which addresses the imposition of a value added tax on certain food sales where the food is not consumed on the premises where sold 
the applicability of the regulation  if any  to the sales under certain of our restaurant distribution methods is unclear at this time 
while we do not anticipate that the regulation will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows  we currently cannot quantify the potential impact  if any  until we have further clarity as to its applicability

there are no licensed units in india 
the units excluded offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  train stations  subways  convenience stores  stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
as licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units  we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information at this time

consolidated financial condition the changes in our goodwill  intangible assets  net  restricted cash  other liabilities and deferred credits  investments in unconsolidated affiliates and redeemable noncontrolling interest are primarily the result of the little sheep acquisition and related purchase price allocation 
see note the decrease in short term borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of million of senior unsecured notes in july liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment 
net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion in each of the last eleven fiscal years  including over billion in both and we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
however  unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns  we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
as of december  we had approximately billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in november china and yri represented more than of the company s segment operating profit in and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development 
to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our us discretionary cash spending  including share repurchases  dividends and debt repayments  we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner 
if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our us business or are unable to refinance future us debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced 
we currently have investment grade ratings from standard poor s rating services bbb and moody s investors service baa 
while we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating  a downgrade would increase the company s current borrowing costs and could impact the company s ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary 
based on the amount and composition of our debt at december   which included no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings 
discretionary spending during  we invested  million in capital spending  including million in china  million in yri  million in the us and million in india 
for  we estimate capital spending will be approximately billion 
during the year ended december  we repurchased shares for million  which includes the effect of million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the fiscal year 
on november   our board of directors authorized share repurchases through may of up to million excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock  and on november   our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases through may of up to billion excluding applicable transaction fees of our outstanding common stock 
at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to million of outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the authorization 
shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the company targets an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of to of net income 
on february   we acquired a controlling interest in little sheep group limited little sheep  a casual dining concept headquartered in inner mongolia  china for million  net of million cash assumed 
see note for details 
borrowing capacity on march   the company executed a five year syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility totaling billion which replaced a syndicated senior unsecured revolving domestic credit facility in the amount of billion and a syndicated revolving international credit facility of million that were both set to expire in november of the credit facility includes participating banks with commitments ranging from million to million and expires on march  we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled billion net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for most borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries 
this agreement contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
given the company s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december  with a considerable amount of cushion 
additionally  the credit facility contains cross default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million  or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness  will constitute a default under such agreement 
the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  our senior unsecured notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes if such acceleration is not annulled  or such indebtedness is not discharged  within days after notice 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other d total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on a nominal basis 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the libor forward yield curve 
debt amounts exclude a fair value adjustment of million related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to nearly  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
d other consists of projected payments for deferred compensation 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities are presented net of potential payments that would be refunded in a future year and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees  the most significant of which are in the us and uk 
the most significant of these plans  the yum retirement plan the plan  is funded while benefits from the other us plans are paid by the company as incurred 
our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan s funded status 
at december  the plan was in a net underfunded position of million 
the uk pension plans are in a net overfunded position of million at our measurement date 
based on the current funding status of the plan and our uk pension plans  we currently estimate that we will not be required to make any contributions in investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption 
future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in and beyond 
our post retirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made post retirement benefit payments of million in and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table 
see note for further details about our pension and post retirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreed to provide financial support  if required  to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs 
we have provided guarantees of approximately million in support of the franchisee loan program at december  the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were million with an additional million available for lending at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately million and million of debt outstanding as of december  and december   respectively 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  that requires an organization to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this standard 
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review long lived assets of restaurants primarily pp e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization semi annually for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant s forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable  we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value 
key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after tax cash flows of the restaurant  which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay  and discount rate 
the after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer  if available  or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows  reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay  for the group of restaurants 
historically  these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
the after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets  including a deduction for the anticipated  future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets 
the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
at december  we had indefinite lived intangible assets of million  million of which was attributable to the little sheep trademark we acquired in we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying value 
if a qualitative assessment is not performed  or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value  then the asset fair value is compared to its carrying value 
fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter and no impairment was recorded 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding the impairment or disposal of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us  our yri business units which are aligned based on geography  our india division and our china division brands 
we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
if a qualitative assessment is not performed  or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties 
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit 
we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of our fourth quarter 
as of that date  our most significant goodwill balance was attributed to our little sheep reporting unit in the amount of million 
this goodwill was recorded upon our acquisition of the little sheep business largely due to the value we expect to generate from applying yum processes and knowledge in china to expand the concept 
the fair values of each of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment testing date 
when we refranchise restaurants  we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained 
the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee  which include a deduction for the anticipated  future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction 
appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates 
when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world 
the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties 
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company 
the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising 
others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit s fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction 
during  the company reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our taco bell us and kfc us operating segments and our pizza hut united kingdom uk business unit 
within our taco bell uk operating segment  restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
within our kfc us operating segment  restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
within our pizza hut uk business unit  dine in and delivery restaurants were refranchised representing of beginning of year company units and million in goodwill was written off representing of beginning of year goodwill 
see note for a further discussion of our refranchising of pizza hut uk see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables guarantees franchise and license receivable balances include continuing fees  initial fees and other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services 
our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
this methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at december  as such  we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at december  we issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants  facilitating franchisee development and equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification  such as franchise lease renewals  when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 
the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  is approximately million  at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
additionally  we have guaranteed approximately million of franchisee loans for various programs 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and  historically  we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees 
if payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees 
at december  we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable 
if we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of  million and a fair value of plan assets of million at december  the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbos using a discount rate of at december  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s or s p with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plan 
we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody s or s p for a potential downgrade if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moody and s p and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbos by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbos by approximately million at our measurement date 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately million in the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets  for purposes of determining pension expense  at december  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point change in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in discount rates over time along with actual asset returns below expected returns have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax actuarial net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and sar awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
stock option and sar grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule 
we re evaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives  respectively 
upon each stock award grant we re evaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated pre vesting forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income taxes at december   we had valuation allowances of million to reduce our billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in currently profitable us federal and state  and foreign jurisdictions as well as us federal and state capital loss and tax credit carryovers that may be carried forward generally for five and ten years  respectively 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
additionally  we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis  totaling approximately billion at december   as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested 
if our intentions regarding the duration of these investments change  deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have processes in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 
at december  and december  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of the same hypothetical basis point increase and the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 
foreign currency exchange rate risk changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings  cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
historically  we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 
the combined operating profits of china  yri and india constitute more than of our segment operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s foreign currency net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
for the fiscal year ended december  operating profit would have decreased approximately million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
this estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors
