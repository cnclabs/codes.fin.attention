business environment as approximately two thirds of our revenues are from the us government  our financial performance is impacted by the level of us defense spending 
currently  the us government  including the department of defense dod  is operating under a continuing resolution cr that provides funding at fiscal year fy levels through march a cr does not generally fund new program starts or new multi year contracts 
a series of crs over the past several years has negatively impacted the flow of contract awards  particularly in our shorter cycle information systems and technology business group 
while us military budgets are generally driven by national security requirements  the country s current fiscal shortfall is negatively influencing defense spending 
the budget control act of bca mandated a billion  or approximately percent  reduction to previously planned defense funding over the next decade 
these cuts were incorporated into the fy proposed defense budget 
in addition  the bca included a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fy  which represents approximately percent of planned defense funding over the period 
if sequestration is triggered  the fy defense budget could be lowered by as much as to billion  or approximately percent 
however  how these reductions would be implemented has not been defined 
congress recently extended the deadline for resolving sequestration to march  as of february   a solution has not been identified 
for fy  the president requested total defense funding of billion  which is down from fy funding of billion 
we anticipate that congress will consider the fy defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current cr at the end of march 
at that time  the cr will either be extended through the government s year end  thereby keeping fy spending at fy levels  or the fy funding bill will be passed 
the president has not yet published the fy budget request  although the fy topline mandated by budget reduction legislation is billion 
because budget expenditures lag congressional funding  our associated revenues and earnings in a given year do not correspond directly with the current year budgeted amounts 
in addition to the impact of us budget deficit reduction negotiations  defense spending decisions over the next several years may also be shaped by the ongoing quadrennial defense review qdr  an analysis of military priorities and requirements commissioned every four years 
we expect defense funding requirements to continue to be influenced by the following the imperative to provide support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  including the dod s increased emphasis on the asia pacific region  the number of troops deployed globally  coupled with the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in iraq and afghanistan since  and the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare  including an emphasis on soldier survivability  enhanced battlefield communications and new technologies in the intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  unmanned systems and cyberspace arenas 
despite these budget uncertainties  the long term outlook for our us defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the military s funding priorities  the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget  our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs  our ability to evolve our products to address a fast changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution 
we continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our us businesses 
while the revenue potential can be significant  international defense budgets  much like us budgets  are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  changing priorities and overall spending pressures 
as a result of the demonstrated success of our products and services  we would expect our international sales and exports to grow subject to overall economic conditions 
in our aerospace group  business jet market conditions were steady in the group benefited from robust flying hours across the installed base of gulfstream aircraft  improved large cabin order interest from north american corporate customers and lower customer contract defaults 
we expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support aerospace s long term growth  as evidenced by the group s newest aircraft offerings  the g and the g similarly  we believe that aircraft service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business jet fleet 
results of operations introduction an understanding of our accounting practices is important to an evaluation of our operating results 
we recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our aerospace and defense business groups 
in the aerospace group  contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s outfitting  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors 
we record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft 
revenues in the aerospace group s other original equipment manufacturers oems completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services 
changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries green and outfitted  progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period 
the majority of the aerospace group s operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor  material and overhead costs 
the costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot 
while changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs  the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered 
operating costs in the aerospace group s completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred 
for new aircraft  operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft  our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid cabin aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the volume  mix and profitability of completions and services work performed  the market for pre owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative g a and net research and development r d costs incurred by the group 
in the defense groups  revenue on long term government contracts is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced or services are rendered 
as a result  changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume  typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs 
year over year variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules 
operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor  material  subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred 
variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and  therefore  result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues 
operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume  performance or contract mix 
performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions may result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract  the estimated costs to complete or both 
therefore  changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability 
it is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted 
contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher vs 
lower margin work 
higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type eg  fixed price cost reimbursable or type of work eg  development production

review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating costs and expenses operating earnings operating margin our revenues and operating costs were up slightly in compared with revenues increased in the aerospace group  primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new g aircraft 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the information systems and technology group s mobile communication systems business 
operating costs also increased due to the impairment of an intangible asset in our aerospace group 
as a result  operating earnings and margins declined in product revenues and operating costs year ended december variance revenues operating costs product revenues were lower in compared with due to lower revenues on mobile communication products and on several ship construction programs  most significantly on the ddg and ddg destroyers and commercial product carrier programs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher aircraft manufacturing  outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the g aircraft 
product operating costs were lower in compared with primarily due to volume 
however  the decrease in volume was partially offset by an impairment of an intangible asset in the completions business in our aerospace group 
service revenues and operating costs year ended december variance revenues operating costs service revenues increased in compared with as growth on it support and modernization programs for the dod and the intelligence community  coupled with the acquisition of vangent  inc  resulted in higher it services revenues 
additionally  the growing global installed base of business jet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues 
service operating costs increased in compared with primarily due to volume

g a expenses as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses were percent in  percent in and percent in the increase in is due  in part  to restructuring related charges in our european military vehicles business discussed below in conjunction with the combat systems business group s operating results 
we expect g a expenses in to be approximately percent of revenues 
interest  net net interest expense was in  in and in the increase in interest expense is due to the net increase in long term debt beginning in july we expect full year net interest expense to be approximately the significant expected decrease from results from our debt refinancing completed in december that lowered the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt from percent to percent 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations

year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green outfitted the aerospace group s revenues increased in compared to the increase consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing  outfitting and completions aircraft services pre owned aircraft total increase aircraft manufacturing  outfitting and completions revenues include the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream business jet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other oems 
aircraft manufacturing  outfitting and completions revenues increased in primarily due to increased deliveries of the g aircraft 
the group s operating earnings increased in the increase consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing  outfitting and completions aircraft services pre owned aircraft g a other expenses total increase earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of gulfstream aircraft increased  or over percent  in compared with primarily due to green deliveries of the g aircraft 
earnings from other oem completions were up in as operational performance improved 
operating earnings in were negatively impacted by of losses on several completions projects and a impairment of the completions business contract and program intangible asset as a result of these losses and lower revenues 
aircraft services earnings decreased in primarily due to a impairment charge on intangible assets in jet aviation s maintenance business  which has been negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive marketplace  particularly in europe 
most significantly  certain oems are performing maintenance work that historically was performed by third party service providers  including jet aviation 
as a result of these market trends  we reviewed the long lived assets of jet aviation s maintenance business in the fourth quarter of and eliminated the remaining value of the contract and program and related technology intangible assets 
we are aligning our jet aviation maintenance business with anticipated future demand  and as a result sold three european based maintenance facilities in december we believe that we have right sized jet aviation s maintenance business to remain profitable  albeit smaller  in the future 
review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin gulfstream aircraft deliveries in units green outfitted the aerospace group s revenues increased in primarily due to additional gulfstream large cabin green and outfitted deliveries  including initial green deliveries of the new g aircraft 
higher aircraft services revenues in  reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business jet aircraft  were offset by lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays and lower volume 
the group s operating earnings decreased in compared with due to the contract losses and intangible asset impairment in our completions business discussed above and from higher r d and selling expenses 
outlook we expect an increase of approximately percent in the group s revenues in compared with  led by gulfstream  and operating margins in the mid percent range 
combat systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margins the combat systems group s revenues decreased in compared with the decrease consisted of the following us military vehicles weapon systems and munitions european military vehicles total decrease in  revenues were up slightly in the group s us military vehicles business 
revenues increased due to the december acquisition of force protection  inc  higher volume on several international light armored vehicle lav programs and the start of the technology development phase of the army s ground combat vehicle gcv program 
these increases were largely offset by lower volume on the domestic stryker  abrams and mine resistant  ambush protected mrap vehicle programs 
lower volume across several us armament and munitions programs  including vehicle armor  mk grenade launchers and hydra rockets  due to slowed defense spending  combined with the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of  resulted in the decrease in revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business 
in the group s european military vehicle business  revenues were down in due to lower volume on multiple wheeled vehicle contracts for various international customers that are nearing completion 
in  final deliveries occurred under several of these contracts  including piranha vehicles for the belgian army  duro vehicles for the swiss government and eagle vehicles for the german government 
the combat systems group s operating earnings and margins decreased in in addition to lower volume  operating results in include the negative impact of three discrete charges in our european military vehicles business for contract disputes accruals  primarily related to the termination of the contract to provide pandur vehicles for portugal of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues  of restructuring related charges  primarily severance  for activities associated with eliminating excess capacity and aligning our european military vehicles business for anticipated lower demand  and of out of period adjustments recorded in the first quarter of of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues 
for further discussion of the status of the portugal program and the restructuring costs  see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact on the group s operating margins from the charges was approximately basis points 
review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margins the combat systems group s revenues were down slightly in compared with due to reduced volume in the group s us military vehicles business 
volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the abrams tank  fewer survivability kits for the stryker vehicle and a decline in activity on the expeditionary fighting vehicle program as the system design and development neared completion 
increased volume to provide lavs for several international customers partially offset these decreases 
partially offsetting the decrease in the group s us military vehicles business  revenues were higher in the group s european military vehicles business due to increased volume on duro and eagle wheeled vehicles for a variety of european customers 
the group s operating earnings and margins were up slightly in due to higher profitability on several major programs in our us military vehicle business 
outlook we expect the combat systems group s revenues in to be down approximately percent from with operating margins in the mid percent range 
the expected decline in revenues is due to anticipated lower services revenues in our us military vehicles business and lower overall revenues in our weapons systems business 
our outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget 
marine systems review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margins operating results the marine systems group s revenues decreased in compared with the decrease consisted of the following ship construction ship engineering  repair and other services total decrease the group s us navy ship construction programs include virginia class submarines  ddg and ddg destroyers  and t ake combat logistics and mobile landing platform mlp auxiliary support ships 
decreased revenues in of on the virginia class and the remainder of the ships in the t ake programs were partially offset by an increase of on the mlp and ddg destroyer programs 
revenues were lower on the virginia class program in due to timing as the group transitions from the block ii to the block iii contract 
in  the group delivered the final ship under the t ake program  resulting in a decrease in revenues 
revenues increased in on the mlp and ddg programs as two ships are now under construction on both programs 
revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the navy in the increase in revenues was driven by recent acquisitions of two east coast surface ship repair operations and higher volume on the ohio class replacement engineering program 
despite the decline in revenues  the marine systems group s operating earnings increased in  resulting in a basis point increase in operating margin compared with increases in the t ake profit rate contributed of operating earnings  approximately basis points of margin expansion  as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction of the final ship 
review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margin revenues in the marine systems group decreased slightly in due to lower volume on the ddg programs  the completion of a five ship commercial product carrier construction program in and the wind down of the t ake program 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the mlp ship construction program  the ohio class replacement program and surface ship repair work 
the group s operating earnings and margins increased in due to favorable cost performance on the mature t ake program 
outlook we expect the marine systems group s revenues to increase approximately percent from with the completion of the t ake program  operating margins are expected to decline to the low to mid percent range in our outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget 
information systems and technology review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings loss operating margins operating results the information systems and technology group s revenues decreased in compared with the decrease consisted of the following mobile communication systems information technology it solutions and mission support services intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems total decrease the decrease in revenues in the mobile communication systems business was driven by slowed defense spending  protracted us customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to follow on work on several contracts 
this resulted in lower revenues in on key programs  including the warfighter information network tactical win t and common hardware systems chs  and for encryption and ruggedized hardware products 
in addition  over percent of the decline in the group s revenues was due to lower volume on the uk based bowman communications system program  which has been successfully fielded and has now moved into maintenance and long term support 
in the group s it solutions and services business  decreased volume in due to the completion of several large scale it infrastructure and support programs for the intelligence community and the dod  including the new campus east  mark center and walter reed national military medical center programs  was largely offset by revenues from the acquisition of vangent  inc revenues were down in compared with in the group s isr business primarily due to lower optical products revenues as demand was impacted negatively by pressured defense budgets and the broader economic environment 
actions taken in to align the business with anticipated future demand are expected to stabilize performance in operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in compared with this decrease was driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges billion goodwill impairment resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of the group caused by topline pressure from slowed defense spending and the threat of sequestration  and margin compression due to mix shift impacting the projected cash flows of the group  of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business  most significantly the contract and program intangible asset  as a result of competitive losses and delays in the fourth quarter of indicative of lower overall demand caused by the economic downturn  write down of substantially all of the remaining ruggedized hardware inventory  including in the third quarter  based on anticipated remaining demand for products that ceased production in  and for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the sv program an additional was recorded by the combat systems group s european military vehicles business

review of vs 
year ended december variance revenues operating earnings operating margins the information systems and technology group s revenues were down in compared with revenues in the mobile communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by crs and protracted us customer acquisition cycles that slowed orders  resulting in lower revenues on ruggedized hardware products  including chs  and other products with shorter term delivery timeframes 
additionally  revenues on the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp were down in as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program 
lower revenues in the group s isr business resulted from the sale of a satellite facility in and lower optical products volume 
offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the it solutions and services business due to the acquisition of vangent  inc  and higher volume on the group s large scale it infrastructure and support programs 
operating earnings decreased at a lower rate than revenues  resulting in a basis point increase in operating margins 
higher margins in our mobile communication systems business were in part due to of overhead reduction initiatives  but were largely offset by growth in our lower margin it solutions and services business 
outlook we expect revenues in the information systems and technology group to be down approximately percent from with operating margins in the low percent range 
our outlook assumes the us government operates under a cr in fy and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget 
due to its shorter cycle businesses  the information systems and technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget reductions that may occur

our total backlog  including funded and unfunded portions  was billion at the end of compared with billion at year end our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts  which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 
idiq contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value 
on december   estimated potential contract value associated with idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  down percent from billion at the end of we expect to realize this value over the next several years 
aerospace aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers 
unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the aerospace group finished with a total backlog of billion  down from billion at year end order activity included demand for products across our portfolio  although orders were lower than in as we have experienced an elongated order cycle 
weaker order activity in the first half of improved somewhat in the second half of the year  including several north american fortune multi aircraft orders 
customer defaults were down significantly from to the lowest level in five years 
we balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize production over time 
this has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our g and g large cabin aircraft  but we have accumulated approximately five years of backlog for the g backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our g backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of that aircraft normalizes 
the group s customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions 
approximately percent of the group s year end backlog was composed of private companies and individual buyers 
while the installed base of aircraft is predominately in north america  international customers represent nearly percent of the group s backlog 
over percent of the group s orders in were from north american customers  as fortune companies took steps in to re capitalize their fleets 
defense groups the total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog includes amounts that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding

for support of the trident missile d life extension program  which extends the life of existing missiles by replacing and upgrading obsolete components 
for the warfighter field operations customer support focus program to provide support for the army s live  virtual and constructive training operations  bringing the value in backlog to information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during  including the following an award from the federal aviation administration to deliver radios that allow air traffic control personnel to communicate with aircraft 
the program has a maximum potential value of over years 
an award from the us department of energy to provide cybersecurity and cloud computing support services 
the program has a maximum potential value of over four years 
an award from the centers for medicare medicaid services to combine the coordination of benefits and the medicare secondary payer systems 
the program has a maximum potential value of over five years 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation 
this focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities 
the billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock  pay dividends and repay maturing debt 
our net debt was at year end  down by from the end of our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated a p or higher 
on december   billion of our cash was held by international operations and therefore  not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated 
while we do not intend to do so  should this cash be repatriated  it would be subject to us federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits 
year ended december net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net cash used by discontinued operations net increase in cash and equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year marketable securities short and long term debt net debt a debt to equity b debt to capital c a net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities 
b debt to equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity 
c debt to capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity 
we expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short and long term liquidity needs 
we believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy 
the following is a discussion of our major operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three years  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities we generated cash from operating activities of billion in  billion in and billion in in all three years  the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings loss after removing the impact of non cash charges 
operating cash flow is also impacted by contributions to our pension plans  which have grown from in to in  with contributions of expected in termination of a program 
as discussed further in note n to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to our expectations  the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories  we  along with the boeing company  could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion on december  if this were the outcome  we would owe half of the total  or approximately billion pretax 
our after tax cash obligation would be approximately we believe we have sufficient resources  including access to capital markets  to pay such an obligation if required 
investing activities we used in  billion in and in for investing activities 
the primary uses of cash for investing activities were acquisitions and capital expenditures 
business acquisitions 
we completed acquisitions over the last three years totaling billion 
we used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of acquisition activity 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were in  in and in the increase in and compared with is largely due to gulfstream s savannah  georgia  facilities expansion project announced in we expect capital expenditures of approximately in  or percent of anticipated revenues  as work on gulfstream s facilities project continues 
on december   the project was approximately percent complete 
marketable securities 
to bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment  we received cash of from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities in  including from the sale of held to maturity securities 
we held no marketable securities on december  other  net 
investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our information systems and technology group in and the detection systems business in our combat systems group in financing activities we used billion in  billion in and billion in for financing activities including issuances and repayments of debt  payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock 
debt proceeds  net 
in august  we repaid of maturing fixed rate notes 
in  we issued billion of fixed rate notes and used the proceeds to repay of maturing fixed rate notes 
in  we issued billion of fixed rate notes and used the proceeds to redeem  prior to maturity  an equal amount of fixed rate notes with higher interest rates 
we have no material repayments of long term debt expected until see note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations  including scheduled debt maturities 
we ended with no commercial paper outstanding 
we have billion in bank credit facilities that remain available 
these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program 
we also have an effective shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission 
dividends 
on march   our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of per share the th consecutive annual increase 
the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to per share in march and per share in march in advance of possible tax increases in  we accelerated our first quarter dividend payment to december share repurchases 
our board of directors typically authorizes repurchases in million share increments 
we repurchased million shares on the open market in  million shares in and million shares in as a result  we reduced our shares outstanding by over percent since on december   approximately million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase  approximately percent of our total shares outstanding 
non gaap management metrics we emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns 
as described below  we use free cash flow and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these areas 
while we believe that these metrics provide useful information  they are not operating measures under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and there are limitations associated with their use 
our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation 
as a result  the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  other gaap measures 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions  repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends 
we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities  as classified on the consolidated statements of cash flows year ended december net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow from operations cash flow as a percentage of earnings loss from continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities nm free cash flow from operations nm not meaningful nm due to net loss in return on invested capital 
we believe roic is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year 
net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings loss from continuing operations plus after tax interest and amortization expense 
roic is calculated as follows year ended december earnings loss from continuing operations after tax interest expense after tax amortization expense net operating profit loss after taxes average debt and equity return on invested capital additional financial information off balance sheet arrangements on december   other than operating leases  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on december  payments due by period contractual obligations total amount committed less than year years years more than years long term debt a capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations b other long term liabilities c a includes scheduled interest payments 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of long term debt 
b includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity  price and timing of delivery 
this amount includes billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses 
c represents other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  including the current portion of these liabilities 
the projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management s estimates  which are based largely on historical experience 
this amount also includes all liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans 
see note p for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them 
amount of commitment expiration by period commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years more than years letters of credit and guarantees see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long term contracts and programs 
other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  and litigation and other contingencies 
we employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application revenue recognition 
we account for revenues and earnings using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced or as services are rendered 
we determine progress using either input measures eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  contract milestones or units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
an input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion 
we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract 
if at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified 
we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion input measure 
for our contracts for the manufacture of business jet aircraft  we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft output measure 
we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors 
accounting for long term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs 
contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events that often span several years 
these assumptions include labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the performance of subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 
we include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
we include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance 
these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time 
as a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts  we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly  as well as when required by specific events or circumstances 
we recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method 
under this method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term 
we use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
these changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned 
most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch up method 
the impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch up method 
the net increase in our operating earnings and on a per share basis from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled in  in and in other than revisions discussed in the marine systems and information systems and technology business groups results of operations  no revisions on any one contract were material in goodwill and intangible assets 
since  we have acquired more than businesses at a total cost of approximately billion  including seven in we have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in our backlog  our performance and profitability under our contracts  our success in securing future business  the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows  and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows 
due to the variables inherent in our estimate of fair value  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis 
to assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows  we compare the sum of our reporting units fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization 
we evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions 
we also review market multiples of earnings from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating characteristics to ensure the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows 
we conducted and completed the required goodwill impairment test as of december  step one of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
as it relates to the test  our reporting units are consistent with our business groups 
slowed defense spending  the threat of sequestration and margin compression due to mix shift have impacted operating results and tempered the projected cash flows of the information systems and technology reporting unit  negatively impacting our estimate of its fair value 
step one of the impairment test concluded that the book value of our information systems and technology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
for our remaining three reporting units  the estimated fair values were at least double their respective book values 
for the information systems and technology reporting unit  we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the results of the step two analysis  we recorded a billion goodwill impairment in we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses  where identified  are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long lived asset 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows 
prior to conducting step one of our goodwill impairment test  we reviewed certain of our long lived assets for recoverability and recorded intangible asset impairment losses of and in our aerospace and information systems and technology groups  respectively  as discussed in the business groups results of operations 
commitments and contingencies 
we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contracts 
such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid 
we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts 
we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
we determine the long term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on our best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
for the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension and post retirement benefit plans  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed under deferred contract costs  our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans 
we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
accordingly  the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and investments 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this annual report on form k for a discussion of these risks 
the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of billion on december   and billion on december  a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses recognized unrecognized this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar  euro canadian dollar and swiss franc euro exchange rates 
we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments  when taken together  do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations and variable rate commercial paper 
on december   we had billion par value of fixed rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not putable  and we do not trade these securities in the market 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 
our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years 
on december   we held billion in cash and equivalents  but held no marketable securities
