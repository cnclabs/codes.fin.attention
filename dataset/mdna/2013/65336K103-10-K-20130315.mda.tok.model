in of the markets that we serve  we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to more than one station 
we refer to these markets as duopoly markets 
the stations we serve are affiliates of nbc stations  cbs stations  abc stations  fox stations  mynetworktv stations and digital multi cast channels  the cw stations and one digital multi cast channel  bounce tv digital multi cast channels and me tv digital multi cast channels and three of our stations are independent

we believe that medium sized markets offer significant advantages over large sized markets  most of which result from a lower level of competition 
first  because there are fewer well capitalized acquirers with a medium market focus  we have been successful in purchasing stations on more favorable terms than acquirers of large market stations 
second  in the majority of our markets only four to six local commercial television stations exist 
as a result  we achieve lower programming costs than stations in larger markets because the supply of quality programming exceeds the demand 
the stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over the air programming to our markets television viewing audiences 
this programming includes a programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated  b programs that the stations produce  and c first run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of commercial air time to local and national advertisers 
we seek to grow our revenue and broadcast cash flow by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  as well as through our growing portfolio of internet based products and services 
we strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news  local sports coverage and active community sponsorship 
we seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high quality local sales force that leverages the stations strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers 
we further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs 
the benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by broadcasting the programming of multiple networks  capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency 
as a result of our operational enhancements  we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations 
our principal offices are at north o connor blvd  suite  irving  tx our telephone number is and our website is http www 
nexstar 
tv 
operating strategy we seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies develop leading local franchises 
each of the stations that we own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand  primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence 
based on internally generated analysis  we believe that in over of our markets in which we produce local newscasts  we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership 
strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty  which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news 
high ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers 
for the year ended december  we earned approximately of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming 
currently  our stations and the stations we provide services to provide between to hours per week of local news programming 
extensive local sports coverage and active sponsorship of community events further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal 
emphasize local sales 
we employ a high quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming 
we believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers  giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source 
additionally  local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters 
for the year ended december   revenue generated from local advertising represented of our consolidated spot revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue 
in most of our markets  we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force 
we also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period 
invest in emedia 
we are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of internet products and services 
our websites provide access to our local news and information  as well as community centric business and services 
we delivered a record audience across all of our web sites in  with million unique visitors  who utilized over million page views 
also in  usage of our mobile platform grew exponentially  accounting for over of our page views by year end 
we also launched redesigned web sites  ready for the emerging touch oriented platforms 
we are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want 
operate duopoly markets 
owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share  enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies 
duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics 
these markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces 
additionally  we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities  eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations 
we derived approximately of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  from our duopoly markets 
maintain strict cost controls 
we emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow 
we continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors 
by leveraging our size and corporate management expertise  we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming  financial  sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to 
capitalize on diverse network affiliations 
we currently own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations  including nbc  cbs  fox and abc affiliated stations which represented approximately    and  respectively  of our net broadcast revenue 
the networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as nba basketball  major league baseball  nfl football  ncaa sports  pga golf and the olympic games 
because network programming and ratings change frequently  the diversity of our station portfolio s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network 
attract and retain high quality management 
we seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets 
most of our station general managers have been granted stock options and have an average of over years of experience in the television broadcasting industry 
acquisition strategy we selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations primarily in markets ranking from to out of the generally recognized television markets  where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management 
when considering an acquisition  we evaluate the target audience share  revenue share  overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters 
additionally  we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets 
relationship with mission through various local service agreements with mission  we provide sales  programming and other services to television stations that are owned and operated by mission as of december  effective january   we also entered into local service agreements to provide sales  programming and other services to mission s newly acquired stations  klrt tv  the fox affiliate  and kasn  the cw affiliate  both in the little rock  arkansas market 
mission is owned by independent third parties 
we do not own mission or any of its television stations 
in compliance with federal communications commission fcc regulations for both us and mission  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
however  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission because of the local service agreements nexstar has with the mission stations  nexstar s guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility  nexstar having power over significant activities affecting mission s economic performance  including budgeting for advertising revenue  advertising sales and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and purchase options granted by mission that permit nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
the purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by nexstar without consent or approval by mission for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness  as defined in the option agreement  or the amount of its indebtedness 
additionally  on november   mission s shareholders granted nexstar an option to purchase any or all of mission s stock  subject to fcc consent  for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of five times the stations cash flow  as defined in the agreement  reduced by the amount of indebtedness  as defined in the agreement  or  these option agreements which expire on various dates between and are freely exercisable or assignable by nexstar without consent by mission or its shareholders 
therefore  mission is consolidated into these financial statements 
we expect our option agreements with mission to be renewed upon expiration

industry background commercial television broadcasting began in the united states on a regular basis in the s 
currently a limited number of channels are available for over the air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the fcc 
all television stations in the country are grouped by ac nielsen company  a national audience measuring service  into generally recognized television markets  known as designated market areas dmas that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience 
each dma is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours 
ac nielsen periodically publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in the dma 
the estimates are expressed in terms of a rating  which is a station s percentage of the total potential audience in the market  or a share  which is the station s percentage of the audience actually watching television 
a station s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates 
most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming  including prime time hours  from networks 
whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks nbc  cbs  fox or abc has a significant impact on the composition of the station s revenue  expenses and operations 
network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the network s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs 
the network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue 
the affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non network programs 
broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations  cable and satellite television systems  the internet and  to a lesser extent  with newspapers and radio stations serving the same market 
non commercial  religious and spanish language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers 
in addition  the internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations 
advertising sales general television station revenue is primarily derived from the sale of local and national advertising 
all network affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations 
our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non network programming  retaining all of the revenue received from these sales 
a national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming 
these programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming 
advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case by case basis 
national advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms 
local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station s local sales staff 
advertising rates are based upon a number of factors  including a program s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target  the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station  the availability of alternative advertising media in the market  the effectiveness of the station s sales force  development of projects  features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming  and the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser 
advertising rates are also determined by a station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  as well as the station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting 
advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies 
conversely  declines in advertising budgets of advertisers  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry and  as a result  may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
seasonality advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years when state  congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the olympic games 
local sales local advertising time is sold by each station s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses  which typically include car dealerships  retail stores and restaurants 
compared to revenue from national advertising accounts  revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable 
we seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties  producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co promoting local events and activities 
we place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on going training program for sales personnel 
national sales national advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies  whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups  telecommunications companies  fast food franchisers  and national retailers some of which may advertise locally

in exchange  the network has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts 
we expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration 
competition competition in the television industry takes place on several levels competition for audience  competition for programming and competition for advertising 
audience 
we compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity 
the popularity of a station s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers 
a portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated 
in those periods  the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers 
stations program non network time periods with a combination of self produced news  public affairs and other entertainment programming  including movies and syndicated programs 
the major television networks have also begun to sell their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices such as tablets and cell phones  which presents an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share 
other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems such as vcrs  dvds and dvrs  video on demand and pay per view  the internet including network distribution of programming through websites and gaming devices 
although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the abc  nbc  cbs and fox television networks  other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems  such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite dbs systems which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market  have become significant competitors for the over the air television audience 
programming 
competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first run and rerun packages of programming 
stations compete against in market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off network reruns such as two and a half men and first run product such as entertainment tonight in their respective markets 
cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming  although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations 
time warner  inc  comcast corporation  viacom inc  the news corporation limited and the walt disney company each owns a television network and also owns or controls major production studios  which are the primary source of programming for the networks 
it is uncertain whether in the future such programming  which is generally subject to short term agreements between the studios and the networks  will be moved to the networks 
television broadcasters also compete for non network programming unique to the markets they serve 
as such  stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events 
advertising 
stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as newspapers  radio stations  magazines  outdoor advertising  transit advertising  yellow page directories  direct mail  local cable systems  dbs systems and the internet 
competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets 
generally  a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas 
the broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media 
further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
the increased use of digital technology by cable systems and dbs  along with video compression techniques  will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission 
these technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems  including over the air broadcasting  and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences 
reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming 
this ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures 
we are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services 
federal regulation television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc under the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the following is a brief discussion of certain provisions of the communications act and the fcc s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations 
over the years  congress and the fcc have added  amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject 
some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole 
for more information about the nature and extent of fcc regulation of television broadcast stations  you should refer to the communications act and the fcc s rules  public notices and policies 
license grant and renewal 
the communications act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the fcc 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
after a renewal application is filed  interested parties  including members of the public  may file petitions to deny the application  to which the licensee renewal applicant is entitled to respond 
after reviewing the pleadings  if the fcc determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest  the fcc is required to hold a trial type hearing on the issues presented 
if  after the hearing  the fcc determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard  the fcc will grant the renewal application 
if the licensee renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions  the fcc can deny the renewal application 
in the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application  the fcc ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing 
no competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application 
in addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application  the fcc may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe fcc rules and policies during the license term  including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture 
station transfer 
the communications act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior fcc approval 
ownership restrictions 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own non us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than in the case of a license entity or in the case of a parent entity non us ownership by vote and by equity 
the fcc also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations 
these ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other entity 
in the case of corporations  officers  directors and voting stock interests of or more or more in the case of qualified investment companies  such as insurance companies and bank trust departments are considered attributable interests 
for partnerships  all general partners and non insulated limited partners are attributable 
limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships 
the fcc also considers attributable the holder of more than of a licensee s total assets defined as total debt plus total equity  if that person or entity also provides over of the station s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the fcc s ownership rules  such as a radio or television station or daily newspaper 
local television ownership duopoly rule 
under the current local television ownership  or duopoly  rule  a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if the two stations do not have overlapping service areas  or after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full power television stations in the dma with overlapping service contours and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the dma 
the duopoly rule allows the fcc to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station only in cases where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt 
under the duopoly rule  the fcc attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in market station when one station owner programs a second in market station pursuant to a time brokerage or local marketing agreement  if the programmer provides or more of the second station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  local marketing agreements entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests until the fcc determines otherwise 
this grandfathering  when reviewed by the fcc  is subject to possible extension or termination 
in certain markets  we and mission own and operate both full power and low power television broadcast stations in utica  nexstar owns and operates wfxv and wpny lp  in binghamton  nexstar owns and operates wivt and wbgh ca  in wichita falls  mission owns and operates kjtl and kjbo lp  and in amarillo  mission owns and operates kcit and kcpn lp 
the fcc s duopoly rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full power television stations and not low power television stations such as wpny lp  wbgh ca  kjbo lp and kcpn lp 
the only markets in which we currently are permitted to own two stations under the duopoly rule are salt lake city  utah  memphis  tennessee  champaign springfield decatur  illinois and little rock pine bluff  arkansas 
however  we also are permitted to own two stations in the fort smith fayetteville springdale rogers  arkansas market pursuant to a waiver under the fcc s rules permitting common ownership of a satellite television station in a market where a licensee also owns the primary station 
in all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements  except for two  we do not provide programming other than news comprising less than of the second station s programming to the second station and  therefore  we are not attributed with ownership of the second station 
in the two markets where we provide more programming to the second station wfxp in erie  pennsylvania and khmt in billings  montana the local marketing agreements were entered into prior to november  therefore  we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the fcc determines otherwise 
national television ownership 
there is no nationwide limit on the number of television stations which a party may own 
however  the fcc s rules limit the percentage of us television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations 
this rule provides that when calculating a party s nationwide aggregate audience coverage  the ownership of a uhf station is counted as of a market s percentage of total national audience 
in  congress determined that one party may have an attributable interest in television stations which reach  in the aggregate  of all us television households  and the fcc thereafter modified its corresponding rule 
the fcc currently is considering whether this act has any impact on the fcc s authority to examine and modify the uhf discount 
the stations that nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of of television households with the uhf discount 
radio television cross ownership rule one to a market rule 
in markets with at least independently owned media voices  ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations  or two television stations if allowed under the television duopoly rule and six radio stations is permitted 
if the number of independently owned media voices is fewer than but greater than or equal to  ownership of one television station or two if allowed and four radio stations is permitted 
in markets with fewer than independent media voices  ownership of one television station or two if allowed and one radio station is permitted 
in calculating the number of independent media voices in a market  the fcc includes all radio and television stations  independently owned cable systems counted as one voice  and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds of the households in the market 
in all cases  the television and radio components of the combination must also comply  respectively  with the local television ownership rule and the local radio ownership rule 
local television newspaper cross ownership rule 
under this rule  a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper 
the fcc is required to review its media ownership rules every four years to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
during  the fcc held a series of hearings designed to evaluate possible changes to its rules 
in may  the fcc formally initiated its review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a notice of inquiry noi 
in december  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm seeking comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules 
among the specific changes proposed in the nprm are elimination of the contour overlap provision of the local television ownership rule making the rule entirely dma based  elimination of the radio television cross ownership rule and modest relaxation of the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule 
the nprm also seeks comment on shared services agreements ssas and other joint operating arrangements between television stations  and whether such agreements should be considered attributable 
initial comments on the nprm were filed on march   and reply comments were filed in april the fcc may act on this proceeding in we cannot predict what rules the fcc will adopt  however  the fcc may deem television jsas to be attributable ownership interests and require the termination of existing jsas within a specified period of time if the newly attributable jsas do not comply with the local television ownership limits 
local television cable cross ownership 
there is no fcc rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area 
cable and satellite carriage of local television signals 
broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations signals on cable  satellite and other multichannel video programming distributors mvpds through either mandatory carriage or through retransmission consent 
every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage must carry for cable distributors and carry one carry all for satellite television providers or retransmission consent 
the next election must be made by october   and will be effective january  must carry elections require that the mvpd carry one station programming stream and related data in the station s local market 
however  mvpds may decline a must carry election in certain circumstances 
mvpds do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage 
a broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights  and the broadcaster and the mvpd must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station s signal 
negotiated terms may include channel position  service tier carriage  carriage of multiple program streams  compensation and other consideration 
if a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms  it is possible that the broadcaster and the mvpd will not reach agreement and that the mvpd will not carry the station s signal 
mvpd operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the us congress and the fcc in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations 
on march   the fcc initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking to reexamine its rules i governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between mvpds and broadcasters  including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement  ii for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute  and iii to extend certain cable only obligations to all mvpds 
the fcc has also asked for comment on eliminating the network non duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules  which may permit mvpds to import out of market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute 
the fcc s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive 
congress and the fcc have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to unserved households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out of market signals 
we and mission elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of our stations where we have a legal right to do so 
we and mission have negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of the mvpds which carry the stations signals 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
since the late s  the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s community of license 
however  television station licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
the fcc may consider complaints from viewers concerning programming when it evaluates a station s license renewal application  although viewer complaints also may be filed and considered by the fcc at any time 
stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things political advertising its price and availability  sponsorship identification  contest and lottery advertising  obscene and indecent broadcasts  technical operations  including limits on radio frequency radiation  discrimination and equal employment opportunities  closed captioning and video description  children s programming  program ratings guidelines  and network affiliation agreements 
technical regulation 
fcc rules govern the technical operating parameters of television stations  including permissible operating channel  power and antenna height and interference protections between stations 
under various fcc rules and procedures  full power television stations completed the transition from analog to digital television dtv broadcasting in june the fcc has adopted rules with respect to the conversion of existing low power and television translator stations to digital operation  establishing a september  deadline by which low power and television translator stations must cease analog operation 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  comprised of  full time and part time employees 
as of december   of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory  and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities 
however  we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future  or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business  such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions 
in the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings  we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  which we believe are the most significant risks related to our business  as well as the other information contained in this document 
risks related to our operations general trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers flock to alternative media  including the internet  for entertainment 
television viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media  including the internet 
as a result  in recent years demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing  and we expect this trend to continue 
the networks may stream their programming on the internet and other distribution platforms in close proximity to network programming broadcast on local television stations  including those we own  and recently some networks have begun streaming special events and sports programming on the internet simultaneously with the broadcast on local stations 
these and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business  financial condition and results of operations of our stations 
we and mission had history of net losses in prior years 
we and mission had aggregate net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we and mission may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in future years 
our substantial debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
as of december   we and mission had million of debt  which represented of our and mission s total combined capitalization 
the companies high level of debt could have important consequences to our business 
for example  it could limit our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future  limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior credit facilities is variable  limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry  and impair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature 
we and mission could also incur additional debt in the future 
the terms of our and mission s senior secured credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt 
to the extent we or mission incur additional debt we would become even more susceptible to the leverage related risks described above 
the agreements governing the company s debt contain various covenants that limit management s discretion in the operation of our business 
the senior secured credit facilities  the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes notes and the indenture governing the senior secured second lien notes notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  make acquisitions  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios  including maximum total and first lien leverage ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
future financing agreements may contain similar  or even more restrictive  provisions and covenants 
as a result of these restrictions and covenants  management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited  and we may be unable to compete effectively  pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements  a default may occur 
a default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
a default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt 
the credit agreement governing nexstar broadcasting s obligations under the senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including maximum total and first lien ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are calculated on a quarterly basis  include the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
the credit agreement governing mission s obligations under the senior secured credit facilities does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  however  it includes an event of default if nexstar broadcasting does not comply with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities 
the indentures governing the notes and the notes contain restrictive covenants customary for debt of their respective types 
mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements 
mission is owned by independent third parties 
mission owns and operates television stations as of december  effective january   mission acquired the assets of klrt tv  the fox affiliate  and kasn  the cw affiliate  both in the little rock  arkansas market  from newport 
we have entered into local service agreements with mission  pursuant to which we provide services to mission s stations 
in return for the services we provide  we receive substantially all of mission s available cash  after satisfaction of operating costs and debt obligations 
we also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
on december   mission entered into the fourth amended and restated credit agreement among it  bank of america  na  as administrative agent and collateral agent  ubs securities llc  as syndication agent  joint lead arranger and joint book manager  rbc capital markets  as documentation agent  joint lead arranger and joint book manager  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  as joint lead arranger and joint book manager  and a syndicate of other lenders  which provides for a first lien credit facility the mission facilities 
the mission facilities consist of a term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
nexstar and nexstar broadcasting guarantee all of the obligations incurred under the mission facilities  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
mission has granted to us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of i seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or ii the amount of its indebtedness 
additionally  mission s shareholders have granted nexstar an option to purchase any or all of mission s stock  subject to fcc consent  for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of i five times the stations cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  reduced by the amount of indebtedness  as defined in the option agreement  or ii  we do not own mission or its television stations 
however  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission because of the local service agreements nexstar has with the mission stations  nexstar s guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission facilities  nexstar having power over significant activities affecting mission s economic performance  including budgeting for advertising revenue  advertising sales and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and purchase options granted by mission that permit nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
in compliance with fcc regulations for both us and mission  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances and personnel for its stations 
as a result  mission s board of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and  as a consequence  the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with mission 
for instance  we may disagree with mission s programming decisions  which programming may prove unpopular and or may generate less advertising revenue 
furthermore  subject to mission s agreement with its lenders  mission s board of directors  comprised solely of shareholders  could choose to pay themselves a dividend 
the recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results 
we and mission currently have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on our assessment of our deferred tax assets  we determined that as of december   based on projected future income  approximately million of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future  and no valuation allowance is currently required for this portion of our deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized we and mission will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and our operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made 
in addition  tax law changes could negatively impact our deferred tax assets 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards nols to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or there is a change in ownership of nexstar 
at december   we had nols of approximately million for us federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
these nols expire at varying dates through to the extent available  we intend to use these nols to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nols that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three year period resulting in an ownership change of more than percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups  which are generally outside of our control 
while our analysis shows that recent public offerings by abry  our largest stockholder  have not resulted in ownership changes that would limit our ability to use these nols  any subsequent ownership changes could result in such a limitation 
in addition  the ability to use nols will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income 
the nols could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income 
to the extent our use of nols is significantly limited  our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use nols  which could have a negative effect on our financial results and results of operations 
the revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks  stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market 
as a result  it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations 
most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements  as of december  stations have primary affiliation agreements with nbc  with cbs  with abc  with fox  with mynetworktv  and with the cw 
additionally  of the stations have secondary affiliation agreements with mynetworktv  with the cw  with me tv and with bounce tv 
each of nbc  cbs and abc generally provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week  while each of fox  mynetworktv and the cw provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  affiliated stations broadcast the respective network s commercials during the network programming 
all of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through december in order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
if any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
further  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances 
for more information regarding these network affiliation agreements  see business network affiliations 
the loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
nexstar s retransmission consent agreements with cable operators  dbs systems  and others permit the operators to carry our stations signals in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration 
the television networks have recently asserted to their local television station affiliates the networks position that they  as the owners or licensees of programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission  are entitled to a portion of the compensation under the retransmission consent agreements and are including these provisions in their network affiliation agreements 
in addition  our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include certain terms that may affect our ability to allow mvpds to retransmit network programming  and in some cases  we may lose the right to grant retransmission consent to such providers 
inclusion of these or similar provisions in our network affiliation agreements could materially reduce this revenue source to nexstar and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  system operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the us congress and the fcc in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations 
on march   the fcc initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking to reexamine its rules governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between mvpds and broadcasters  including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement  for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute  and to extend certain cable only obligations to all mvpds 
the fcc also asked for comment on eliminating the network non duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules  which may permit mvpds to import out of market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute 
if the fcc prohibits joint negotiations or modifies the network non duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules  such changes could materially reduce this revenue source and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fcc could decide not to grant renewal of the fcc license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if  during the preceding term  the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
on october   the director of the central illinois chapter of the parents television council ptc submitted an informal objection to the application for renewal of license for nexstar s station wcia in champaign  illinois  requesting the fcc withhold action on wcia s license renewal application until the fcc acts on the ptc s complaint regarding an allegedly indecent broadcast on wcia 
on january   cable america corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for nexstar s station kozl and mission s station kolr  both licensed to springfield  missouri 
cable america alleged that nexstar s local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
nexstar and mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and cable america submitted a reply 
cable america subsequently requested that the fcc dismiss its petition 
however  the petition remains pending with the fcc 
nexstar and mission filed renewal of license applications for their stations between june and april the majority of these applications  including the wcia  kozl and kolr applications discussed above remain pending with the fcc 
once a renewal application is timely filed  a station may continue to operate under its license even if its expiration date has passed 
we and mission expect the fcc to renew the licenses for our stations in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the fcc will do so 
on june   the fcc s renewal cycle for television stations reinitiated 
nexstar broadcasting and mission are required to submit new renewal of license applications for the stations between june  and april  third parties are permitted to submit objections to these applications 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of perry a 
sook  our founder and president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus 
the loss of mr 
sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations 
the television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation  which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets 
therefore  even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets  we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
fcc rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire additional television stations 
television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
fcc rules limit the number of television stations a company may own and define the types of local service agreements that count as ownership by the party providing the services 

those rules are subject to change 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if  for example  the fcc or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our growth  our operating results will suffer 
since january   we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  having acquired over stations and contracted to provide service to approximately additional stations as of february  we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities  such as the recent acquisitions from newport  smith media and granite 
to manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions  we will need  among other things  to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems 
we will also need to continue to identify  attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel 
failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business 
there are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that we may not be able to successfully reduce costs  increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station  an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities  our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business  we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems  as well as company policies and cultures  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
fcc actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements  which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy 
in some of our markets  we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements 
while these agreements take varying forms  a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner 
by operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market  we and the other station achieve significant operational efficiencies 
we also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market 
while all of our existing local service agreements comply with current fcc rules and policies  the fcc may not continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly type opportunities 
on august   the fcc initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements jsas attributable under its ownership rules 
comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of the fcc has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding 
the fcc is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
during  the fcc held a series of hearings designed to evaluate possible changes to its rules 
in may  the fcc formally initiated its review of its media ownership rules with the issuance of a notice of inquiry noi 
in december  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on specific proposed changes to its ownership rules 
among the specific changes proposed in the nprm are elimination of the contour overlap provision of the local television ownership rule making the rule entirely dma based  elimination of the radio television cross ownership rule and modest relaxation of the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule 
the nprm also sought comment on shared services agreements ssas and other joint operating arrangements between television stations  and whether such agreements should be considered attributable 
initial comments on the nprm were filed on march   and reply comments were filed in april we cannot predict what rules the fcc will adopt or when they will be adopted 
however  the fcc might act on these proceedings in and may deem tv jsas to be attributable ownership interests and require the termination of existing jsas within a specified period of time if the newly attributable jsas do not comply with the local television ownership limits 
if the fcc adopts a jsa attribution rule  or any other new or modified rule affecting the ownership of or local service agreements between television stations  we will be required to comply with such rules 
the fcc may decide to terminate grandfathered time brokerage agreements 
the fcc attributes time brokerage agreements and local marketing agreements tbas to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides or more of a station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  tbas entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests for now 
the fcc will review these grandfathered tbas in the future 
during this review  the fcc may determine to terminate the grandfathered period and make all tbas fully attributable to the programmer 
if the fcc does so  we and mission will be required to terminate the tbas for stations wfxp and khmt unless the fcc simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets 
the level of foreign investments held by our principal stockholder  abry  may limit additional foreign investments made in us 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than in the case of a licensed entity or in the case of a parent company non us ownership by vote and by equity 
because our majority shareholder  abry  has a substantial level of foreign investment  the amount of additional foreign investment that may be made in us is limited to approximately of our total outstanding equity 
the interest of our principal stockholder  abry  in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under fcc rules 
the broadcast or other media interests of our officers  directors and stockholders with or greater voting power are attributable under the fcc s rules  which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of otherwise non attributable equity and or debt in a licensee in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or daily newspaper in the same market 
abry  our principal stockholder  is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments 
as a result of abry s interest in us  we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where abry has an attributable interest in television stations or other media  which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our certificate of incorporation allows abry and its affiliates to identify  pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
we are controlled by one principal stockholder  abry  and its interests may differ from your interests 
as a result of abry s controlling interest in us  abry is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs 
abry is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  five of our directors are affiliated with abry 
abry s interests may differ from the interests of other security holders and abry could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our security holders 
furthermore  this concentration of ownership by abry may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
we and mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets  and therefore we and mission could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges 
as of december   million  or  of our and mission s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
we and mission test goodwill and fcc licenses annually  and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets  in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
we and mission test network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows 
the methods used to evaluate the impairment of nexstar s and mission s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of nexstar s and mission s television stations  or a forecast of such reductions  a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which nexstar s and mission s television stations operate  the loss of network affiliations  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among others  which may be beyond our or mission s control 
if the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment  such non cash charge could materially affect nexstar s and mission s financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments and any decrease or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline 
our common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our board of directors 
our new dividend policy  announced on november   authorized us to declare a total annual cash dividend with respect to shares of our class a common stock and class b common stock of per share in equal quarterly installments of per share 
on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share which was paid on march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy 
however  future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and can be changed or discontinued at any time 
dividend determinations including the amount of the cash dividend  the record date and date of payment will depend upon  among other things  our future operations and earnings  capital requirements and surplus  general financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 
in addition  the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends 
given these considerations  our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future 
risks related to our industry our operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result  we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time 
our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control  including the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based media  particularly newspapers  cable television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located 
because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns  the reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership  and we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenue to decline 
in addition  we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate  and effectively react to  shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets 
because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs  primarily for debt service  broadcast rights and personnel 
other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies  our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue 
as a result  a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations 
nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack 
as a result  advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed upon times in the future 
advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods  and space may not be available for such advertising 
the duration of such preemption of local programming cannot be predicted if it occurs 
in addition  our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends  our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively 
new technologies could also adversely affect our television stations 
information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable  direct satellite to home services  pay per view  the internet  telephone company services  mobile devices  digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access 
over the past decade  cable television programming services  other emerging video distribution platforms and the internet have captured an increasing market share  while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined 
in addition  the expansion of cable and satellite television  the internet and other technological changes have increased  and may continue to increase  the competitive demand for programming 
such increased demand  together with rising production costs  may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming 
in addition  video compression techniques  now in use with dbs systems  cable and wireless cable are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth 
these compression techniques as well as other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems  including over the air broadcasting  and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences 
reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming  resulting in more audience fractionalization 
this ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures 
we are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations 
the fcc can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent 
in  the fcc began to impose substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the communications act and its rules 
the fcc also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television 
in one of several judicial appeals of fcc enforcement actions  a federal court in july held the fcc s indecency standards to be unconstitutionally vague under the first amendment 
the us supreme court agreed to review that decision and in june  issued a narrow decision setting aside fcc orders citing fox and abc for indecency violations  finding that the fcc failed to provide adequate prior notice that the sanctioned materials could be found actionably indecent 
the us supreme court did not otherwise address whether the fcc s current indecency policy is consistent with the first amendment 
because our and mission s stations programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated  we and mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations  and we and mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the fcc finds such programming to be indecent 
fines may be imposed on a television broadcaster for an indecency violation to a maximum of  per violation 
intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and profitability 
as a television broadcasting company  we face a significant level of competition  both directly and indirectly 
generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television 
specifically  stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share  programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media  including newspapers  radio stations  cable television  dbs systems and the internet 
the entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
the markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from  among other things  technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view  home video and entertainment systems and internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to increased competition 
we may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions 
we are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future  the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business 
the fcc could implement regulations or congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole 
the fcc has initiated proceedings to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements and shared services agreements attributable interests under its ownership rules  to determine whether it should establish more detailed criteria and additional recordkeeping and reporting obligations with respect to broadcasters requirements to serve the local public interest  and to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules  including the radio television cross ownership rule and the newspaper television cross ownership rule  and whether to modify its retransmission consent rules 
changes to any of these rules may have significant impact on us and the stations to which we provide services 
in addition  the fcc has sought comment on whether there are alternatives to the use of dmas to define local markets such that certain viewers whose current dmas straddle multiple states would be provided with more in state broadcast programming 
if the fcc determines to modify the use of existing dmas to determine a station s local market  such change might materially alter current station operations and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fcc also may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties  any of which might have such an impact 
congress also may act to amend the communications act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general 
the fcc may reallocate some portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use which alteration could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming 
the fcc has initiated various proceedings to assess the availability of spectrum to meet future wireless broadband needs 
the fcc s march national broadband plan recommends the reallocation of megahertz of the spectrum currently used for broadcast television for wireless broadband use 
the fcc has so far adopted rules permitting television stations to share a single megahertz channel and requested comment on proposals that include  among other things  whether to add new frequency allocations in the television bands for licensed fixed and mobile wireless uses and whether to implement technical rule modifications to improve the viability of certain channels that are underutilized by digital television stations 
in february  the us congress adopted legislation authorizing the fcc to conduct an incentive auction whereby television broadcasters could voluntarily relinquish all or part of their spectrum in exchange for consideration 
on september   the fcc issued a notice of proposed rule making seeking public comment on the design of the incentive auction and various technical issues related to the reallocation of television spectrum for mobile broadband use 
comments on the notice were filed in january  and reply comments are due in march a reallocation of television spectrum for wireless broadband use would likely involve a repacking of the television broadcast band  which would require some television stations to change channel or otherwise modify their technical facilities 
future steps to reallocate television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities  could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations  and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals 
we cannot predict the timing or results of television spectrum reallocation efforts or their impact to our business

overview of operations we owned and operated television stations and digital multi cast channels as of december  through various local service agreements  we programmed or provided sales and other services to additional television stations and four digital multicast channels  including television stations and four digital multicast channels owned and operated by mission as of december  all of the stations that we program or provide sales and other services to  including mission  are owned by independent third parties 
the following table summarizes the various local service agreements we had in effect as of december  with mission service agreements mission stations tba only wfxp and khmt ssa jsa kjtl  kjbo lp  kolr  kcit  kcpn lp  kamc  krbc  ksan  wutr  wawv  wyou  kode  wtvo  ktve and wtvw we have a time brokerage agreement tba with each of these stations which allows us to program most of each station s broadcast time  sell each station s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to mission 
we have both a shared services agreement ssa and a joint sales agreement jsa with each of these stations 
each ssa allows our station in the market to provide services including news production  technical maintenance and security  in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from mission as described in the ssas 
each jsa permits us to sell the station s advertising time and retain a percentage of the station s net advertising revenue  as described in the jsas 
our ability to receive cash from mission is governed by these local service agreements 
under the local service agreements  we have received substantially all of mission s available cash  after satisfaction of its operating costs and debt obligations 
we anticipate we will continue to receive substantially all of mission s available cash  after satisfaction of its operating costs and debt obligations 
we also guarantee all obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility 
similarly  mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes 
in consideration of our guarantee of mission s senior secured credit facility  mission has granted us purchase options to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for an amount equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement  or the amount of its indebtedness 
additionally  on november   mission s shareholders granted nexstar an option to purchase any or all of mission s stock  subject to fcc consent  for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of five times the stations cash flow  as defined in the agreement  reduced by the amount of indebtedness  as defined in the agreement  or  these option agreements which expire on various dates between and are freely exercisable or assignable by nexstar without consent by mission or its shareholders 
these option agreements expire on various dates between and and are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by mission 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration 
we do not own mission or its television stations 
however  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission because of the local service agreements nexstar has with the mission stations  nexstar s guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility  nexstar having power over significant activities affecting mission s economic performance  including budgeting for advertising revenue  advertising and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and purchase options granted by mission that permit nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
in compliance with fcc regulations for both us and mission  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances and personnel for its stations 
the operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from broadcast and website advertising revenue  which is affected by a number of factors  including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate  the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks 
for the years ended december  and  revenue generated from local broadcast advertising represented and  respectively  of our consolidated spot revenue total of local and national broadcast advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue 
the remaining broadcast advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising 
all national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies 
the agencies receive a commission rate of of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them 
while the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies  some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations local sales staff  thereby eliminating the agency commission 
each station also has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for sales representation outside the particular station s market 
advertising schedules received through the national representative firm are for national or large regional accounts that advertise in several markets simultaneously 
national commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station s agreement 
most of our stations have a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the stations during specified time periods  including prime time 
nbc and cbs compensate some of the stations for distributing the network s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods 
the affiliation agreements with abc  fox  mynetworktv  the cw and bounce tv do not provide for compensation 
in recent years  in conjunction with the renewal of affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs  abc and fox  network compensation is being eliminated and many of the networks are now seeking cash payments from their affiliates 
each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non news and non network time periods 
the licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license 
the latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged using historical advertising rates  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the programming expense is recognized over the license period or period of usage  whichever ends earlier 
our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue  employee compensation and benefits  newsgathering and programming costs 
a large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remains relatively fixed 
seasonality advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
the company s stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years  when state  congressional and presidential elections occur and from advertising aired during the olympic games 
as was an election year  we are reporting significantly more political advertising revenue in compared to  which is consistent with our expectations

the proceeds of the notes were used to retire the notes and the pik notes  repay the amounts outstanding under our previous senior secured credit facility and for related fees and expenses

on october   we and mission entered into amendments to each of our senior secured credit facilities

the increase was primarily due to expenses of the acquired stations in december and during the second half of  increase of million in programming costs primarily due to the renewed network affiliation agreements entered into during and  as well as increases of million in amounts paid under station outsourcing agreements 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in employee health claims of million and a million decrease in provision for bad debts due to our improved accounts receivable collection practices 
amortization of broadcast rights  excluding barter was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or  of which million is attributable to changes in sports programming on one of our stations and million attributable to general programming mix changes among our stations 
these were partially offset by the million incremental amortization of broadcast rights of acquired stations in and amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to termination of certain fox affiliation contracts which were fully amortized in  partially offset by incremental amortization from acquired stations

income taxes the company recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of million for the same period in  an increase in income tax benefit of million 
the increase in income tax benefit was due to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for nols and other deferred tax assets partially offset by the tax provision for prior to  the company s provision for income taxes was primarily created by an increase in the deferred tax liability position arising from the amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company released its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for nols and other deferred tax assets 
management s assessment included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including recent net operating loss utilization against its taxable income  cumulative pre tax book income over the last three years  historical operating results  projected future taxable income over the net operating loss carryforward period  the anticipated ability to sustain a level of earnings  a lower weighted average cost of debt  growth of the company s e media platform and revenue  and the continued renewal of network affiliation and retransmission consent agreements on favorable economic terms 
due to strong financial results and improved credit profile in recent years  the company was able to obtain a decreased interest rate of on its new senior unsecured notes and a lower interest rate on its refinanced senior secured credit facilities in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company expanded its line of credit and borrowing capacity on favorable terms that significantly enhanced the company s ability to grow strategic market share through acquisition 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of ten television stations in seven markets and inergize digital media from newport which followed three station acquisitions in due to the accretive acquisitions in and the acquisition from newport in  the company generated pre tax income of million from continuing operations 
this expected level of earnings makes it more likely than not that a substantial portion of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the results of our in depth assessment  management determined that it was more likely than not that the nols and other deferred tax assets were realizable based on all available positive and negative evidence 
as a result  the company decreased its valuation allowance by million through its income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
management made the more likely than not assessment separately for both nexstar and mission 
mission files federal and state income tax returns separately from nexstar 
mission is a variable interest entity and there is no common ownership with nexstar that would allow it to join in a consolidated filing 
for this reason  the net operating losses and other deferred tax items of mission are assessed separately on the basis of realization on the separately filed income tax return

future sources of financing and debt service requirements as of december   nexstar and mission had total combined debt of million  which represented of nexstar and mission s combined capitalization 
our and mission s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt  which reduces the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
nexstar and mission had million of total unused revolving loan commitments under our respective senior secured credit facilities  all of which was available for borrowing  based on the covenant calculations as of december  the company s ability to access funds under its senior secured credit facilities depends  in part  on our compliance with certain financial covenants 
any additional drawings under senior secured credit facilities will reduce our future borrowing capacity and the amount of total unused revolving loan commitments 
the following table summarizes the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature for the periods referenced as of december  in thousands total thereafter nexstar senior secured credit facility mission senior secured credit facility senior secured second lien notes due senior unsecured notes due we make semiannual interest payments on our notes on april and october of each year 
we will make semiannual interest payments on our notes on may and november of each year 
we fully paid all debt outstanding on our notes and pik notes in interest payments on our and mission s senior secured credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months and are payable based on the type of interest rate selected 
the terms of the nexstar and mission senior secured credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our respective notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing credit facilities  obtain access to new credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such debt 
debt covenants our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  b a maximum consolidated first lien indebtedness ratio  and c a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are calculated on a quarterly basis  include the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
mission s senior secured credit facility does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  however  it does include an event of default if nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement 
the notes and notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type 
we believe we and mission will be able to maintain compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured facilities and the indentures governing our respective notes for a period of at least the next twelve months from december  no off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our arrangements with mission are on balance sheet arrangements 
our variable interests in other entities are obtained through local service agreements  which have valid business purposes and transfer certain station activities from the station owners to us 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the following summarizes nexstar s and mission s contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total thereafter nexstar senior secured credit facility mission senior secured credit facility senior secured second lien notes due senior unsecured notes due cash interest on debt broadcast rights current cash commitments broadcast rights future cash commitments executive employee contracts operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations excludes broadcast rights barter payable commitments recorded on the consolidated financial statements as of december  in the amount of million 
includes the employment contracts for all corporate executive employees and general managers of our stations 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the company has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
the resolution of these tax positions may not require cash settlement due to the existence of nols 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  bad debts  broadcast rights  retransmission revenue  trade and barter and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
for an overview of our significant accounting policies  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
consolidation of mission and variable interest entities we regularly evaluate our local service agreements and other arrangements where we may have variable interests to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
under us gaap  a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights 
accounting rules expand the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights 
in applying accounting and disclosure requirements  we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entity s economic rewards 
our evaluation of the risks and rewards model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change 
mission is included in our consolidated financial statements because we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in mission as a vie for financial reporting purposes as a result of local service agreements we have with the mission stations  our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility  our power over significant activities affecting mission s economic performance  including budgeting for mission s advertising revenue  advertising sales and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and purchase options granted by mission which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
additionally  on november   mission s shareholders granted nexstar an option to purchase any or all of mission s stock  subject to fcc consent  for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of five times the stations cash flow  as defined in the agreement  reduced by the amount of indebtedness  as defined in the agreement  or  these option agreements which expire on various dates between and are freely exercisable or assignable by nexstar without consent by mission or its shareholders 
these purchase options expire on various dates between and and we expect them to be renewed upon expiration 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets represented million  or  of our total assets as of december  intangible assets principally include fcc licenses  goodwill and network affiliation agreements 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a market by market basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the market reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view  manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the reporting unit and the prevailing values in the markets for broadcasters 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the reporting unit s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill 
we test network affiliation agreements whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the operations to which the asset relates is less than its carrying value 
we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses tested for impairment as of december  and  resulting in no need for impairment charges 
all of the fair values of our reporting units and fcc licenses tested for impairment exceeded their carrying amounts 
in aggregate  our fair values exceeded their book values by a margin of the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
we utilized the following assumptions in our impairment testing for the years ended december market growth rates operating profit margins fcc licenses operating profit margins goodwill discount rate tax rate capitalization rate allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
broadcast rights carrying amount we record broadcast rights contracts as an asset and a liability when the license period has begun  the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable  we have accepted the program material  and the program is available for broadcast 
we consider programs that have been produced prior to our contract period to be available for broadcast  while programs that are produced throughout the contract period are recorded and amortized as they are aired 
broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
cash broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors programming 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the programming received 
the fair value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical rates for specific time periods 
amortization of broadcast rights is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or programming usage  whichever period yields the shorter life 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year 
when projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights  for example  due to poor ratings  we amortize the broadcast rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenue 
if the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled we would be required to write off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately 
as of december   the carrying amounts of our current broadcast rights were million and non current broadcast rights were million 
retransmission revenue we earn revenues from local cable providers  dbs services and other mvpds for the retransmission of our broadcasts 
these revenues are generally earned based on a price per subscriber of the mvpd within the retransmission area 
the mvpds report their subscriber numbers to us periodically  generally upon payment of the fees due to us 
prior to receiving the mvpd reporting  we record revenue based on management s estimate of the number of subscribers  utilizing historical levels and trends of subscribers for each mvpd 
trade and barter transactions we trade certain advertising time for various goods and services 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
we barter advertising time for certain program material 
these transactions  except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming  are recorded at management s estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the fair value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
we recorded barter revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade revenue of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred trade and barter expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nols that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
ownership by our principal shareholder  abry  could limit our ability to use our nols 
ownership changes are evaluated as they occur 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income taxes as components of income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements  including our expected date of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
the interest rate on the term loan borrowings under the senior credit facilities was as of december  and the interest rate on the revolver loans was  which represented the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements 
including the impact of the libor floor on our term loans  an increase in libor of basis points one percentage point from its december  level would increase our annual interest expense and decrease our cash flow from operations by million  based on the outstanding balance of our credit facilities as of december  an increase in libor of basis points one half of a percentage point or decrease in libor by or basis points would not have any impact on our annual interest expense and our cash flow from operations 
our notes and our notes are fixed rate debt obligations and therefore are not exposed to market interest rate changes 
as of december   we have no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on our senior credit facilities 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate
