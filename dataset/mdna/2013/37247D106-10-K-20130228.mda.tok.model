table of contents products and services the majority of our us mortgage insurance policies provide default loss protection on a portion typically to of the balance of an individual mortgage loan 
our primary mortgage insurance policies are predominantly flow insurance policies  which cover individual loans at the time the loan is originated 
we also enter into bulk insurance transactions with lenders and investors in selected instances  under which we insure a portfolio of loans for a negotiated price 
in addition to flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance  we previously have written a limited amount of mortgage insurance on a pool basis 
under pool insurance  the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans  typically for of all losses on every loan in the portfolio  subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit 
flow insurance flow insurance is primary mortgage insurance placed on an individual loan when the loan is originated 
our primary mortgage insurance covers default risk on first mortgage loans generally secured by one to four unit residential properties and can be used to protect mortgage lenders and investors from default on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument that we have approved 
our insurance covers a specified coverage percentage of a claim amount consisting of unpaid loan principal  delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure 
as the insurer  we are generally required to pay the coverage percentage of a claim amount specified in the primary master policy  but we also have the option to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal  delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure  and acquire title to the property 
in addition  the claim amount may be reduced or eliminated if the loss on the defaulted loan is reduced as a result of the lender s disposition of the property 
the lender selects the coverage percentage at the time the loan is originated  often to comply with investor requirements to reduce the loss exposure on loans purchased by the investor 
our master policies require that loans be underwritten to approved guidelines and provide for cancellation of coverage and return of premium for material breach of obligations 
our master policies generally do not extend to or cover material breach of obligations and misrepresentations known to the insured or specified agents 
from time to time  based on various factors  we request loan files to verify compliance with our master policies and required procedures 
where our review and any related investigation establish material non compliance or misrepresentation or there is a failure to deliver complete loan files as required  we rescind coverage with a return of all premiums paid 
in connection with flow insurance  we perform fee based contract underwriting services for certain mortgage lenders 
the provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers eliminates the duplicative lender and mortgage insurer underwriting activities and speeds the approval process 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria  subject to contractual limitations on liability 
in the united states  we have entered into a number of reinsurance agreements in which we share portions of our flow mortgage insurance risk written on loans originated or purchased by lenders with captive reinsurers affiliated with these lenders 
in return  we cede a predetermined portion of our gross premiums on insurance written to the captive reinsurers 
substantially all of our captive mortgage reinsurance arrangements are structured on an excess of loss basis 
in february  fannie mae and freddie mac announced a change to its eligibility rules limiting captive reinsurance arrangements to those where premiums ceded do not exceed of gross premiums 
as of december   our mortgage insurance risk in force reinsured to all captive reinsurers was million  and the total capital held in trust for our benefit by all captive reinsurers was million 
these captive reinsurers are not rated  and their claims paying obligations to us are secured by an amount of capital held in trust as determined by the underlying treaties 
as of december  and  we ceded us mortgage insurance loss reserves of million and million  respectively  under these captive reinsurance arrangements 
we have exhausted certain captive reinsurance tiers for our   and book years based on worsening loss development trends 
once the captive reinsurance or trust assets are 
table of contents exhausted  we are responsible for any additional losses incurred 
we have begun to experience constraints on the recognition of captive benefit recovery due to the amount of funds held in certain captive trusts and the exhaustion of captive loss tiers for certain reinsurers 
as of january   we no longer participate in excess of loss captive reinsurance transactions and we will only participate in quota share reinsurance arrangements 
the majority of our excess of loss captive reinsurance arrangements are in runoff with no new books of business being added going forward  however  while this level of benefit is declining  we do continue to benefit from captive reinsurance on our   and books of business 
new insurance written through the bulk channel generally is not subject to these arrangements 
the following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our captive reinsurance arrangements as of or for the periods indicated as of or for the years ended december  flow risk in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of flow risk in force primary risk in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total primary risk in force gross written premiums ceded pursuant to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total gross written premiums primary new risk written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total primary new risk written bulk insurance under primary bulk insurance  we insure a portfolio of loans in a single  bulk transaction 
generally  in our bulk insurance  the individual loans in the portfolio are insured to specified levels of coverage and there may be deductible provisions and aggregate loss limits applicable to all of the insured loans 
in addition  loans that we insure in bulk transactions with loan to value ratios above typically have flow mortgage insurance  written either by us or another private mortgage insurer  which helps mitigate our exposure under these transactions 
we base the premium on our bulk insurance upon our evaluation of the overall risk of the insured loans included in a transaction and we negotiate the premium directly with the securitizer or other owner of the loans 
premiums for bulk transactions generally are paid monthly by lenders  investors or a securitization vehicle in connection with a securitization transaction or the sale of a loan portfolio 
prior to  the majority of our bulk insurance business was related to loans financed by lenders who participated in the mortgage programs sponsored by the federal home loan banks fhlbs 
beginning in  we selectively increased our participation in the gse low documentation  or alt a  programs and began to provide bulk insurance on lender portfolios  a substantial portion of which was comprised of low loan to value and high fico score payment option adjustable rate poa loans 
the risk in force attributable to these through books of business was substantially reduced in pursuant to agreements reached with the insured 
in january  we reached an agreement with a counterparty that further reduced our bulk insurance exposure  leaving a small portfolio related principally to the fhlbs 
in addition  the fhfa has issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to implement provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act that require deletion of all references to credit rating agencies in federal rules and regulations 
this would likely include rules that govern mortgage purchase programs of the fhlbs that require insurers for such programs to maintain aa ratings 
however  there can be no assurance with respect to our level of participation in these programs once the fhfa program rules are revised 
pool insurance pool insurance generally covers the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that either exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage if primary insurance is required on that loan or the total loss if that loan does not require primary insurance  in each case up to a stated aggregate loss limit on the pool 
while in and  we wrote a limited amount of pool insurance coverage policies  we are no longer actively writing pool insurance 

table of contents underwriting and pricing loan applications for all flow loans we insure are reviewed to evaluate each individual borrower s credit strength and history  the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property 
fair isaac company developed the fico credit scoring model to calculate a score based upon a borrower s credit history 
we use the fico credit score as one indicator of a borrower s credit quality 
typically  a borrower with a higher credit score has a lower likelihood of defaulting on a loan 
fico credit scores range up to  with a score of or more generally viewed as a prime loan and a score below generally viewed as a sub prime loan 
a minus loans generally are loans where the borrowers have fico credit scores between and  and where the borrower has a blemished credit history 
as of december   on a risk in force basis and at the time of loan closing  approximately of our primary insurance loans were prime in credit quality with fico credit scores of at least  approximately had fico credit scores between and  and approximately had fico credit scores of or less 
loan applications for flow mortgage insurance are reviewed by our employees directly as part of our traditional underwriting process or by our contract underwriters as we process mortgage loan applications requiring mortgage insurance 
while declining in recent periods  the majority of our mortgage lender customers underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance under a delegated underwriting program  in which we permit approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using underwriting guidelines we have previously approved 
when underwriting bulk insurance transactions  we evaluate credit scores and loan characteristics of the loans in the portfolio and examine loan files on a sample basis 
each bulk transaction is assigned an overall claim rate based on a weighted average of the expected claim rates for each individual loan that comprises the transaction 
we previously offered mortgage insurance for alt a loans  which were originated under programs in which there was a reduced level of verification or disclosure of the borrower s income or assets and a higher historical and expected default rate at origination than standard documentation loans  interest only loans which allowed the borrower flexibility to pay interest only  or to pay interest and as much principal as desired  during an initial period of time  and poa mortgages  which typically provided four payment options that a borrower could select for the first five years of a loan 
beginning in the second half of and through  however  we took specific and substantial underwriting and risk management actions to reduce our new business risk profile  including exiting certain products and types of coverages such as alt a  interest only and poa loans  as well as changing prices  product levels and underwriting guidelines  to improve the performance of new business written 
our primary guideline actions during the fourth quarter of included adding incremental geographic locations to our declining market policy definition and changes in third party loan origination guidelines  including restrictions on delegated underwriting guidelines  as well as imposing tighter underwriting guidelines on lower credit and higher loan to value risks 
additionally  with increased refinancing activity  we also added new restrictions on fico and debt to income ratios to better manage risk profiles and capital consumption from new production 
we believe these and other underwriting and pricing actions benefited our underwriting results on these and future books of business and could have an adverse impact on our volume of new insurance written 
as market conditions stabilized or improved in certain areas  we adjusted our approaches 
for example  during  we eliminated our targeted declining market policy  which among other things  prohibited us from providing coverage on loans above loan to value  even in areas of the us housing market where such conditions had begun to stabilize or improve 
during the second quarter of  we announced reduced pricing and expanded underwriting guidelines that over time are expected to increase our competitiveness in the mortgage insurance market 
we continue to monitor current housing conditions and the performance of our books of business to determine if we need to make further changes in our underwriting guidelines and practices 
loss mitigation we request loan files to verify compliance with our master policies 
where underwriting is performed in house  our master policy gives us the right to obtain a copy of the complete loan file for any insured loan 
if no file is produced in response to our request  the master policy provides that coverage may be canceled 
if a file is 
table of contents delivered but lacks certain documents that are critical to demonstrating compliance with applicable underwriting standards discussed below or to our ability to investigate the loan for misrepresentation  we issue a follow up request and give the servicer an additional period of time approximately additional days to produce the missing documents 
if these documents are not received after the additional time period  the master policy provides that coverage may be canceled 
where underwriting is delegated to other counterparties under specified criteria  our master policy requires that an insured loan be underwritten in strict accordance with applicable guidelines 
where our file review finds material non compliance with the underwriting requirements  the master policy provides that coverage may be canceled 
the master policy also excludes coverage for fraud and misrepresentation  among other matters 
where our investigation establishes non compliance or fraud or misrepresentation involving an agent of the lender  we invoke our rights by issuing a letter rescinding coverage on the loan 
following an action to rescind coverage on insured loan certificates  we permit reconsideration of our decision to rescind such coverage through an appeals process 
if an insured counterparty appeals our decision to rescind coverage on given loan certificates and we concur that new or additional information is sufficient for us to reinstate coverage  we take the necessary steps to reinstate uninterrupted insurance coverage and reactivate the loan certificate 
if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the stated appeal period provided by us and such additional time as the parties may agree to  lenders may choose to pursue arbitration under the master policies and challenge the results 
if arbitrated  ultimate resolution of the dispute would be pursuant to a panel s binding arbitration award 
challenges to rescissions may be made several years after we have rescinded coverage on an insured loan certificate 
as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we routinely investigate insured loans and evaluate the related servicing to ensure compliance with applicable requirements under our master policy 
as a result  from time to time  we curtail the amount of the claim payable based upon this evaluation 
estimated savings related to rescissions are the reduction in carried loss reserves  net of premium refunds and reinstatement of prior rescissions 
estimated savings related to loan modifications and other cure related loss mitigation actions represent the reduction in carried loss reserves 
estimated savings related to claims mitigation activities represent amounts deducted or curtailed from claims due to acts or omissions by the insured or the servicer with respect to the servicing of an insured loan that is not in compliance with obligations under our master policy 
for non cure related actions  including pre sales  the estimated savings represent the difference between the full claim obligation and the actual amount paid 
if a loan certificate that was previously rescinded is reinstated and the underlying loan certificate remains delinquent  we re accrue any liabilities that were relieved in connection with our decision to rescind coverage on the loan certificate 
distribution we distribute our mortgage insurance products through our dedicated sales force throughout the united states 
this sales force primarily markets to financial institutions and mortgage originators  which in turn offer mortgage insurance products to borrowers 
in addition to our field sales force  we also distribute our products through a telephone sales force serving our smaller lenders  as well as through our action center which provides live phone and web chat based support for all customer segments 
competition we compete primarily with us and state government agencies  other private mortgage insurers  mortgage lenders and other investors  the gses and  potentially  the fhlbs 
we also compete  indirectly  with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate credit risk although this last category of competition has been reduced by the dynamics of the financial crisis 
us and state government agencies 
we and other private mortgage insurers compete for flow business directly with us federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the federal housing administration fha and  to a lesser degree  the veteran s administration va 
in november  federal legislation was enacted that extended the authority of the fha to insure loans with initial balances 
table of contents in amounts up to of median area home prices of up to and including  with this new legislation in place  the fha now has higher loan limits than do fannie mae and freddie mac in certain metropolitan service areas msas 
accordingly  this could give the fha a competitive advantage in those msas over private mortgage insurance providers 
in addition to competition from the fha and the va  we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state supported mortgage insurance funds in several states  including california  illinois and new york 
private mortgage insurers 
the competitive landscape of the us private mortgage insurance industry changed significantly in  with two competitors ceasing to write new business and the addition of one new entrant within the industry 
during  the competitive landscape of the us private mortgage insurance industry changed further with the addition of another new entrant in the industry 
in  a new entrant acquired a subsidiary of a former competitor that had been placed in receivership 
while we cannot predict the level of impact  continued changes in the competitive landscape of the us private mortgage insurance industry will likely impact our sales levels 
the private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of six mortgage insurers  including us 
mortgage lenders and other investors 
we and other mortgage insurers compete with transactions structured by mortgage lenders to avoid mortgage insurance on low down payment mortgage loans 
these transactions include self insuring and simultaneous second loans  which separate a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of more than  which in the absence of such a structure would require mortgage insurance  into two loans a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio of and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan 
the level of simultaneous second mortgages declined substantially in recent years given the experience from the financial crisis 
the gses fannie mae  freddie mac and fhlbs 
as the predominant purchasers of conventional mortgage loans in the united states  fannie mae and freddie mac provide a direct link between mortgage origination and capital markets 
as discussed above  most high loan to value mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac are insured with private mortgage insurance issued by an insurer deemed qualified by the gses 
our us mortgage insurance companies currently are permitted by the gses to operate as eligible insurers even though not all eligibility criteria have been met 
private mortgage insurers may be subject to competition from fannie mae and freddie mac to the extent the gses are compensated for assuming default risk that would otherwise be insured by the private mortgage insurance industry 
in february  the obama administration issued a white paper setting forth various proposals to gradually eliminate fannie mae and freddie mac 
since that date  members of congress  various housing experts and others within the industry have also published similar proposals 
we cannot predict whether or when any proposals will be implemented  and if so in what form  nor can we predict the effect such proposals  if so implemented  would have on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we also compete with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults  such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes  with lenders who forego mortgage insurance self insure on loans held in their portfolios  and with mortgage lenders who maintain captive mortgage insurance and reinsurance programs 
private mortgage insurers must satisfy requirements set by the gses to be eligible to insure loans sold to the gses  and the gses have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers 
they also have the authority to change the pricing arrangements for purchasing retained participation mortgages  or mortgages with lender recourse  as compared to insured mortgages  increase or reduce required mortgage insurance coverage percentages  and alter or liberalize underwriting standards and pricing terms on low down payment mortgages they purchase 
in addition to the gses  fhlbs purchase single family conforming mortgage loans 
although not required to do so  the fhlbs currently use mortgage insurance on substantially all mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio above
