forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations of the company and are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project may  will or similar expressions 
although we believe our plans  intentions and expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that these plans  intentions  or expectations will be achieved 
our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  the legislative regulatory climate  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the quality or composition of the bank s loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in our market area  our plans to expand our branch network and increase our market share  and accounting principles  policies and guidelines

critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the company s transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting i accounting standards codification asc contingencies previously statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  ii asc receivable previously sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance and iii sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  which requires adequate documentation to support the allowance for loan losses estimate 
the company s allowance for loan losses has three basic components the specific allowance  the general allowance and the unallocated component 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance and or non homogeneous loans identified as impaired 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support and financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
the general allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans and other consumer loans 
also  the general allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance and or non homogeneous loans which were not identified as impaired 
the general allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the company also considers trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the general allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the general allowance also captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 

table of contents specifically  the company uses both external and internal qualitative factors when determining the non loan specific allowances 
the external factors utilized include unemployment in the company s defined market area of fauquier county  prince william county  and the city of manassas market area  as well as state and national unemployment trends  new residential construction permits for the market area  bankruptcy statistics for the virginia eastern district and trends for the united states  and foreclosure statistics for the market area and the state 
quarterly  these external qualitative factors as well as relevant anecdotal information are evaluated from data compiled from local periodicals such as the washington post  the fauquier times democrat  and the bull run observer  which cover the company s market area 
additionally  data is gathered from the federal reserve beige book for the richmond federal reserve district  global insight s monthly economic review  the george mason school of public policy center for regional analysis  and daily economic updates from various other sources 
internal bank data utilized includes loans past due aging statistics  non performing loan trends  trends in collateral values  loan concentrations  loan review status downgrade trends  and lender turnover and experience trends 
both external and internal data is analyzed on a rolling eight quarter basis to determine risk profiles for each qualitative factor 
ratings are assigned through a defined matrix to calculate the allowance consistent with authoritative accounting literature 
a narrative summary of the reserve allowance is produced quarterly and reported directly to the company s board of directors 
the company s application of these qualitative factors to the allowance for loan losses has been consistent over the reporting period 
the company employs an independent outsourced loan review function  which annually substantiates and or adjusts internally generated risk ratings 
this independent review is reported directly to the company s board of directors audit committee  and the results of this review are factored into the calculation of the allowance for loan losses 
interest rate swap agreements used for interest rate risk management 
interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
the company utilizes an interest rate swap agreement as part of the management of interest rate risk to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the company s interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide valuations for interest rate swaps using standard swap valuation techniques 
the company has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets and has considered its own credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap liabilities 
income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
there were no unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a liability as of december  and interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of income 
the company has no uncertain tax positions 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding the company and the bank and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements

table of contents net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in with the growth of average loans  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in the bank s net interest margin resulting from the prolonged historically low levels in market interest rates 
the bank is also subject to a decline in net interest income due to competitive market conditions and or a flat or inverted yield curve 
a steeper yield curve is projected to result in an increase in net interest income  while a flatter or inverted yield curve is projected to result in a decrease in net interest income

provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  and asset quality the provision for loan losses was million for  million for  and million for the amount of the provision for loan loss for   and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in the bank s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
greater weight is given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
the million increase in the provision for loan losses from million in to million in was largely in response to the million increase in net loan charge offs in from  as well as the million increase in non performing loans over the same time period 
this was partially offset by the million reduction in total loans prior to the allowance for loan losses 
the  decrease in the provision for loan losses from million in to million in was largely in response to the million decrease in total gross loans outstanding over the same time period  partially offset by the  increase in net loan charge offs from to 
table of contents loan portfolio at december    and  net loans accounted for   and  of total assets  respectively  and were the largest category of the company s earning assets 
loans are shown on the balance sheets net of unearned discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
interest is computed by methods that result in level rates of return on principal 
loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectible  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
authoritative accounting guidance requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified as impaired is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
the guidance also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when there is an identified weakness that makes it probable that the bank will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not necessarily be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under authoritative accounting guidance 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
the bank considers all consumer installment loans and smaller residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to impairment under authoritative accounting guidelines 
asset quality non performing assets  in most cases  consist of loans  other real estate owned  repossessed property such as automobiles and pooled trust preferred securities that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans and investments that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
a troubled debt restructuring tdr identification process has been established using a template of questions that determine whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and  if so  whether the bank has granted a concession to a borrower by modifying the loan 
then  mitigating factors are evaluated to determine a final conclusion as to the whether the loan is a tdr

analysis of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on net realizable values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on the company s statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level and nature of impaired and non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and  the allowance for loan losses was million  million  million  million and million  respectively

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier capital to average assets as defined in the regulations

the company entered into one swap agreement with a total notional amount of million dated september  to manage the interest rate risk related to a commercial loan 
the agreement allows the company to convert fixed rate assets to floating rate assets through the company receives interest monthly at the rate equivalent to one month libor plus and pays at the fixed rate of 
interest differentials paid or received under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest income and expense 
these interest rate swap agreements are considered derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting 
the notional amounts of the interest rate swaps are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counter party  the risk in these transactions is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
the bank is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  the bank is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that interest rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value of equity under varying market rate assumptions 
the bank monitors exposure to instantaneous changes both up and down in rates of basis points  basis points  basis points and basis points over a rolling month and month period 
the bank has a two tier policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from all instantaneous changes in interest rates up to basis points 
the first limit  or a level i variance  indicates a risk which is approaching unacceptable levels and could be reflective of an unfavorable balance sheet trend 
when a level i variance is reached  an explanation of the variance is reported to the board of directors until the variance is within policy 
this report to the board of directors analyzes whether the variance represents a long term problem  or if the variance will be self correcting 
if the variance is determined to be a long term problem  the level ii actions will be taken 
a level ii measurement represents a risk to earnings which is unacceptable to senior management 
if a level ii measurement is reached  an action plan is presented to the board of directors to decrease variance level 
this action plan may include  but is not limited to  changing loan pricing to alter fixed vs 
adjustable rate balances  changing time deposit pricing to alter term length of deposits  use of fhlb borrowings to lengthen duration  restructure the duration maturity structure of the investment portfolio  use of off balance sheet hedging instruments such as swaps  and adjust pricing of non maturity deposits 
management has maintained a risk position well within all policy guideline levels during and
