com online store and leapfrog app center 
during  we delivered strong financial results including net sales growth  reduced operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  near triple operating profit  and more than triple income before taxes 
in addition  we maintained strong operating cash flow  improved working capital by million  and increased our cash balance by 
our results for the current and prior years include certain significant non recurring items and trends that impacted our year over year and quarter over quarter comparisons  most notably in our tax line 
in the fourth quarter of  we released million of an allowance against our deferred tax assets that was initially established in in addition  our results included million and million in and  respectively  of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in certain of our foreign jurisdictions 
also notable is that the leappad tablet family of products was sold for the full year in as compared to less than half of a year in higher than planned inventory levels at the end of  resulting from weaker than expected demand late in that year  negatively impacted sales for the first quarter of  which also added to the favorable over comparison 
outlook we are excited about our market leading portfolio and new product launches for  which include a new learn to read system  new iphone and ipad app activity products and a new version of our leappad tablet 
as a result  despite a global economy that remains sluggish and a us toy industry that declined in  we anticipate continued business growth at a pace ahead of the market with net sales expected to increase at a high single digit percentage growth rate 
similar to  we will prepare to fulfill orders above our plans whenever possible 
to support our market leading growth and ongoing business transformation  we plan to make long term investments in content  international expansion  online communities  systems  and new platforms 
even with this investment in our future  we expect our operating margin as a percentage of net sales to remain consistent with our expectations for are subject to many uncertainties  including the timing and strength of any economic recovery and many factors described in risk factors under part i  item a of this form k

the us dollar weakened against several of our foreign currencies during while it strengthened in  resulting in a million unrealized foreign currency translation loss for the third quarter of additionally in that quarter  an operational error resulted in our entering into forward hedging contracts that differed from what we had intended 
as a result of this error  we recorded a million realized loss on foreign exchange forward contracts in our us segment

the us dollar strengthened significantly against several of our foreign currencies late in the third quarter of  resulting in a million realized foreign currency translation loss and a million unrealized foreign currency translation loss for the third quarter of that quarter also included the operational error noted above 
income taxes our benefit from provision for income taxes and effective tax rates were as follows dollars in millions benefit from provision for income taxes income before income taxes effective tax rate our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as tax expense relative to the amount of income earned in our domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
our tax rate is also affected by discrete items  such as tax benefits attributable to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
our effective tax rates for and reflected a non cash valuation allowance recorded against of our domestic deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no federal or state tax expense or benefit was recorded on our domestic operating income or loss for those periods 
our effective tax rate included the release of a portion the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets resulting in a benefit for the year 

table of contents during  after considering the relative impact of all evidence  positive and negative  we determined  at the required more likely than not level of certainty  that a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized 
due to the high seasonality of our business with a significant portion of our annual income earned late in the year  this determination was made at the end of the fourth quarter after the critical holiday season had passed and actual results for the year were known 
although we believe profitability will continue in the near term and add to our three year cumulative profit position  based on the duration and severity of losses in prior years  rapidly changing consumer demands  increasing pace of technological innovation  significant product  retailer and seasonal revenue concentrations  transition at the highest levels of our management  and unproven new product pipeline  we could not project future earnings beyond  at a more likely than not level of certainty  to support an assertion that our domestic operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  based on projected future earnings  a deferred tax valuation allowance release of million was recorded as an income tax benefit for the year 
this benefit was offset by a non cash valuation allowance of million recorded against the deferred tax assets of our subsidiary in mexico as we determined  at the required more likely than not level of certainty  that our subsidiary in mexico will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets 
the change in our domestic and foreign valuation allowance balances resulted in a net million income tax benefit for the year 
as of december   we have maintained a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets related to various net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits  and loss carryforwards that are capital in nature 
we will continue to evaluate all evidence in future periods to determine if further release of our valuation allowance is warranted 
in addition  the tax benefit for and included million and million  respectively  in benefit associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in some of our foreign jurisdictions  offset by foreign tax expense and certain discrete tax items including amortization of goodwill for tax purposes and an accrual for potential interest and penalties on certain tax positions

the increase in cash balance was primarily due to an increase in net sales 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we do not intend to repatriate any foreign cash and cash equivalents as it will be used to fund foreign operations 
however  if we were to do so  any associated tax liability would be fully offset by our net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards for the foreseeable future 
in line with our investment policy  all cash equivalents were invested in high grade money market funds  including treasury money market funds  at december  we have an asset based revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a potential borrowing availability of million for the months of september through december and million for the remaining months 
there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at december  we do not expect our accumulated deficit of million at december  to be indicative of our future ability to generate cash flow  given our anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our revolving credit facility 
future capital expenditures are primarily planned for new product development and purchases related to the upgrading of our information technology capabilities 
we expect that capital expenditures in  including those for capitalized content and website development costs  will be funded with cash flows generated by operations 
capital expenditures were million for  million for  and million  including a million purchase of intangible assets  for we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for the year ending december  we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  as well as our ability to comply with all of the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility  depend on our future operating performance and cash flows  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions

table of contents dollars in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total historically  our cash flow from operations has been highest in the first quarter of each year when we collect a majority of our accounts receivable booked in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in the current year  an increase in credit card based sales through our app center in the fourth quarter resulted in higher cash flow from operations than the first quarter  a deviation from our historical norm that may continue in future years  given the increasing sales from our app center 
cash flow used in operations tends to be highest in our third quarter  as collections from prior accounts receivable taper off and we invest heavily in inventory in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season 
historically  cash flow generally turns positive again in the fourth quarter as we begin to collect on the accounts receivable associated with the holiday season 
based on the shift in ordering patterns by retailers beginning in  which resulted in orders being placed significantly later in the year  cash flows from operations in the fourth quarter of were significantly lower than has historically been the case in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
as a result  cash flows from operations in the first quarter of were higher than in previous years 
earlier demand in resulted in significantly higher inventory purchases during the third quarter and higher collections in the fourth quarter 
these seasonal patterns may vary depending upon general economic conditions and other factors

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
we believe that certain accounting policies  which we refer to as critical accounting policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the use of significant estimates and the application of significant judgment by our management 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  particularly those related to our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and other accounts receivable and revenue reserves we derived the majority of our revenue from sales of our technology based learning products and related proprietary content 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement  delivery has occurred  there is a fixed or determinable fee and collection is reasonably assured 
we sell app center cards to retailers and directly to end customers  which are redeemable on our app center for content downloads 
we record proceeds from the initial sale of the card to deferred revenue  which are then recognized into revenue when the right to download content is granted to the customer upon redemption of the card 
for content purchased by the customer with a personal credit card directly through our app center  we recognize revenue when the right to download content is granted 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs are recognized as revenue 
costs incurred to ship merchandise from warehouse facilities are recorded in cost of sales 

table of contents net sales represent gross sales less estimated sales returns  allowances for defective products  promotional markdowns  chargebacks and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements 
correspondingly  these allowances are recorded as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
we reduce our gross accounts receivable balance by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
determining such allowance requires judgment  the result of which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
if changes in the economic climate or in the financial condition of any of our customers impair or improve their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
we also provide estimated allowances against revenue and accounts receivable for sales returns  defective products  promotional markdowns  chargebacks and price changes  and cooperative promotional arrangements in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the allowances are estimated utilizing historical information  maximum known exposures and other available information including current retailer inventory levels  sell through of its retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for its products  changes in customer demand for its products and other related factors 
accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet net of all provided allowances  which included the allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory costs on the balance sheet based on third party contract manufacturer invoices  which include the contract manufacturers costs for materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products 
inventory valuation primarily requires estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
our estimate of the write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on management s review of on hand inventories compared to their product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
inventories included write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories of million and million at december  and  respectively 
capitalization of product costs we capitalize certain external costs related to the development of content for our learning products  including design  artwork  animation  layout  editing  voice  audio and apps included in the learning products 
such costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of the product is established and costs are determined to be recoverable 
amortization of these costs is included in cost of sales and begins when the products are initially released for sale and generally continues over a two year life using the straight line method 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized amounts periodically and recognize write downs in the statements of operations as needed 
capitalized content costs that are cancelled  abandoned or otherwise deemed impaired are charged to cost of sales in the period of cancellation 
write downs of capitalized costs related to platforms being discontinued or non performing titles resulted in an increase in cost of sales in the us segment of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents we also capitalize external website development costs website costs  which primarily include third party costs related to developing applications that are integral components of certain products we market  costs incurred to develop or acquire and customize code for web applications  costs to develop html web pages or develop templates  and costs to create initial graphics for the website that included the design or layout of each page 
website costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized website costs periodically and if an impairment loss is considered to have occurred during the period  we accelerate the amortization and record it in depreciation and amortization in the statement of operations in the same period 
our evaluations of capitalized content development costs and website costs require us to make complex and subjective judgments  using currently available data as well as projections about the potential impact of possible future events and conditions  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
if future events and conditions do not meet expectations  we make additional adjustments to reduce the expected realizable value of the assets  with corresponding increases to cost of sales 
capitalized content development costs and website costs are both included in capitalized product costs on the balance sheet  net of accumulated amortization 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that warrant a review 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors or operating performance indicators 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  if an entity determines  after assessing such qualitative factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the qualitative assessment concludes that it is probable that there is impairment  then a quantitative assessment must be performed 
we early adopted this guidance for our december  annual goodwill impairment test 
our qualitative assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances that may impact the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which our goodwill is allocated 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgment and assumptions 
relevant events and circumstances identified include  but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  leapfrog specific events and share price trends 
additional judgment is required to determine relative importance and impact of each factor 
application of the two step goodwill impairment test  if determined necessary  requires significant judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  and projections of future net cash flows  which are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow methodology 
the market approach requires considerable judgment in selecting comparable companies and estimating the multiples of revenue implied by their market values 
the discounted cash flow methodology requires management to exercise judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate and to make numerous assumptions in order to develop future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future sales of our products  which are inherently difficult to predict 
this is especially true when a significant portion of our future net sales is expected to be generated by both mature products as well as products introduced in or planned to be introduced in 
table of contents after analyzing our goodwill at december  and  we concluded no impairment charge was required in either period 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
the determination of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax benefits  tax credits and deductions 
significant changes in these estimates or variations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences may result in material increases or decreases in the tax provision or benefit in subsequent periods 
we provide valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is warranted requires consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against all of our gross domestic deferred tax assets as we could not assert  at the required more likely than not level of certainty  that the level of future profitability needed to realize the benefit of our domestic deferred tax assets could be achieved 
as of december   the balance of our domestic deferred tax assets increased to million  primarily due to additional net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  partially offset by utilization of tax benefits 
during  our deferred tax asset balance was reduced by million  primarily due to utilization of tax benefits and release of a portion of our remaining valuation allowance 
at december   we maintained a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
such adjustments could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in and  we recorded million and million in benefits  respectively  associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in some of our foreign jurisdictions 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally four years using the straight line method 
determining the fair value of stock based compensation awards at grant date requires significant judgment and estimates regarding valuation variables such as volatility  expected forfeiture rates and the expected term of the awards 
stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our actual forfeiture rates and the extent of future grants of equity awards 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected
