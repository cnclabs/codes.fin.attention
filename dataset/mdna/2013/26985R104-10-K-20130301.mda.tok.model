commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  ngls and other commodities as a result of our gathering  processing  producing and marketing activities  which produce a naturally long position in these commodities 
our profitability and cash flow are affected by changes in prices of these commodities 
these prices are impacted by changes in the supply and demand for these commodities  as well as market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control 
historically  changes in the prices of ngls have generally correlated with changes in the price of crude oil 
for a discussion of the volatility of crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices  please read risk factors 

table of contents we manage this commodity price exposure through an integrated strategy that includes management of our contract portfolio  matching sales prices of commodities with purchases  optimization of our portfolio by monitoring basis and other price differentials in our areas of operations  and the use of derivative contracts 
crude oil  natural gas and ngl prices can also indirectly affect our profitability by influencing the level of drilling activity and related opportunities for our service 
we frequently use financial derivatives hedges  which may include swaps  collars and options  among others  to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk 
these hedges are only intended to mitigate the risk associated with our natural physical position 
in  we began conducting commodity derivative trading activities through ergs  our natural gas marketing and trading subsidiary 
ergs trading portfolio includes transactions that are settled through the physical delivery of the underlying product and financially settled contracts  primarily basis derivatives transacted to capture spread differentials between physical index points where transportation capacity has been subscribed 
if the value of these positions change in a direction or manner that we did not anticipate or cannot manage  it could negatively impact our cash flows 
as of december   our commodity hedge portfolio totaled million  which consists of assets aggregating million less liabilities aggregating million 
for additional information  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our hedging activities and related fair values 
effectiveness of commodity risk management activities the goal of our commodity risk management activities is to reduce the impact of changing commodity prices on our ability to make future distributions to our unitholders 
one way we evaluate the effectiveness of these activities is to analyze the theoretical change in our internal estimates of future adjusted ebitda given an assumed change in future commodity prices 
using this method  we estimate that a per barrel increase in nymex crude oil prices  a per barrel decrease in nymex crude oil prices and a per mmbtu change in nymex natural gas prices would result in changes to adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  based on per barrel and per mmbtu commodity prices 
users of this information should be aware that these estimates rely on a large number of assumptions that may ultimately prove to be false 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  future production rates  future volumes delivered to our plants and systems  future costs and other economic conditions  and future relationships between crude oil prices and natural gas liquids prices 
interest rate risk we are exposed to variable interest rate risk as a result of borrowings under our existing credit agreement 
to mitigate its interest rate risk  we have entered into various interest rate swaps 
these swaps convert the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
the purpose of entering into these swaps is to eliminate interest rate variability by converting libor based variable rate payments to fixed rate payments 
amounts received or paid under these swaps were recorded as reductions or increases in interest expense 
on june   we extended million notional amount of our interest rate swaps from their original maturity dates of december  to a new maturity date of june  and blended the existing swap rate for these extended swaps with the then prevailing interest swap rate  which lowered the rate from to 
based upon the transactions discussed in the paragraph above  we estimate that for  a increase or decrease in the current libor rates would impact our interest expense by million

the table below summarizes the changes in commodity and interest rate risk management assets for the applicable periods 
table of contents year ended december  december  in thousands net risk management assets at beginning of period contracts acquired through acquisitions cash paid received to terminate contracts  net cash received paid from settled contracts settlements of positions unrealized mark to market valuations of positions balance of risk management assets at end of period credit risk our principal natural gas sales customers are large industrial  commercial and utility companies 
with respect to the sale of our ngls and condensates  our principle customers are large natural gas liquids purchasers  fractionators and marketers  and large condensate aggregators that then typically sell to large multi national petrochemical and refining companies 
we also sell a small amount of propane to medium sized  local distributors 
for the year ended december   oneok  inc and chevron corporation  our largest customers  represented and  respectively  of our total sales revenue including realized and unrealized gains on commodity derivatives 
all of our natural gas sales are under day payment term deals  with credit based upon days of deliveries and almost all other product sales contracts are under day payment term arrangements 
this concentration of credit risk may affect our overall credit risk in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids  petrochemical and other segments of the energy industry  the economy in general  the regulatory environment and other factors 
in evaluating credit risk exposure we analyze the financial condition of each counterparty before entering into an agreement 
our corporate credit policy lists the resource materials and information required to assess the financial condition of each prospective customer 
the credit threshold for each customer is also based upon a time horizon for exposure  which is typically days or less 
we establish these credit limits and monitor and adjust them on an ongoing basis 
we also require counterparties to provide letters of credit or other collateral financial agreements for exposure in excess of the established threshold 
all of our sales agreements contain adequate assurance provisions to permit us to mitigate or eliminate future credit risk  at our sole discretion  by suspending deliveries until obligations and payments are satisfied or by canceling the agreement 
our derivative counterparties include bnp paribas  wells fargo bank  national association  comerica bank  bank of nova scotia  the royal bank of scotland plc  bank of america na  j aron and company an affiliate of goldman sachs  ing capital markets llc  bbva compass bank  royal bank of canada  regions financial corporation and citibank  na
