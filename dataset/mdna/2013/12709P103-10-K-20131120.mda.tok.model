the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements which are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our supplies high performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp polishes surfaces at an atomic level  thereby enabling ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp consumables 
we develop  produce and sell cmp slurries for polishing many of the conducting and insulating materials used in ic devices  and also for polishing the disk substrates and magnetic heads used in hard disk drives 
we also develop  manufacture and sell cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we also pursue other demanding surface modification applications through our engineered surface finishes esf business where we believe we can leverage our expertise in cmp consumables for the semiconductor industry to develop products for demanding polishing applications in other industries 
our fiscal results reflected a strengthening of demand for our products during the second half of the fiscal year after the soft industry demand conditions we saw during the first half of the fiscal year  which was similar the demand pattern we experienced in fiscal the semiconductor industry saw continuation of the trend of a significant shift in demand from semiconductor devices for personal computers pcs to those for mobile internet devices mids  specifically  consumer products such as smart phones and tablets 
in addition  over this same period  the semiconductor industry has experienced slower growth than in the past 
given the increased importance of the consumer based mid demand  the semiconductor industry appears to have demonstrated more seasonality around consumer oriented back to school and holiday calendar periods in recent years 
it also appears that as the semiconductor industry continues to consolidate  capital spending within the industry is becoming more concentrated among fewer and larger semiconductor manufacturers  which seems to be resulting in more rational addition of production capacity  and  in turn  less cyclicality within the industry 
since we serve the entire semiconductor market  fluctuations in demand for our products have generally reflected overall industry activity 
our results over the last two fiscal years have demonstrated these trends as we have experienced relatively slow growth with more seasonal swings in demand 
there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including those discussed in part i  item a entitled risk factors in this form k 

index revenue for fiscal was million  which represented an increase of from million reported for fiscal the increase in revenue from fiscal was driven by a higher priced product mix  partially offset by foreign exchange rate changes  primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
we experienced increased sales of our slurries for polishing aluminum and dielectrics 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of our tungsten slurry  esf and polishing pads product lines 
revenue generated from polishing pads decreased in fiscal  although we increased the actual number of pads sold 
the decrease in revenue was due to competitive pricing pressure and customer efficiencies in certain customers use of our pads  combined with the slow pace of new business wins 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents an increase from the reported for fiscal  and was above the upper end of our full year guidance range of to of revenue 
the increase in gross profit percentage from fiscal was primarily due to the favorable impact of the weaker japanese yen and lower fixed manufacturing costs 
we are increasing our gross profit guidance for full fiscal year to be in the range of to of revenue 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in our product mix  which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
operating expenses of million  which include research  development and technical  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  decreased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the absence of bad debt expense related to a customer bankruptcy that we reported in the second quarter of fiscal and costs associated with our fiscal leveraged recapitalization with a special cash dividend  as well as lower depreciation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our annual incentive cash bonus program aip 
in fiscal  we are lowering our full year guidance range for operating expenses to be in the range of million to million 
diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased  or  from reported in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit margin  a lower effective tax rate  a favorable impact of the weaker japanese yen reflected in other income and higher sales 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reinstatement of the us research and experimentation tax credit and our election in the third quarter of fiscal to permanently reinvest the earnings of our subsidiaries in japan and south korea 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  valuation and classification of auction rate securities  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

index allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
in fiscal  we recorded million in bad debt expense for elpida memory  inc elpida  a significant customer in japan that filed for bankruptcy protection in february pursuant to its approved bankruptcy plan  elpida will pay us approximately of the balance owed over a period of seven years 
consequently  we charged off approximately of the elpida accounts receivable balance against the related allowance for doubtful accounts during the fourth quarter of fiscal we will continue to monitor the financial solvency of all of our customers and  if global economic conditions weaken  we may have to record additional increases to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expenses would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet our specifications and customers performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventories written off applied against the inventory value at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
if we had increased our reserve for obsolete inventory at september  by  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
valuation and classification of auction rate securities as of september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with an estimated fair value of million million par value which are classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
in general  ars investments are securities with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction every seven to days 
historically  these periodic auctions provided a liquid market for these securities 
beginning in  general uncertainties in the global credit markets reduced liquidity in the ars market  and this illiquidity continues 

index as discussed in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have recorded a temporary impairment of million  net of tax  in the value of one of our ars in other comprehensive income 
the calculation of fair value and the balance sheet classification for our ars requires critical judgments and estimates by management  including an appropriate discount rate and the probabilities that a security may be monetized through a future successful auction  of a refinancing of the underlying debt  of a default in payment by the issuer  and of payments not being made by the bond insurance carrier in the event of default by the issuer 
an other than temporary impairment must be recorded when a credit loss exists  that is when the present value of the expected cash flows from a debt security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
we performed two discounted cash flow analyses  one using a discount rate based on a market index comprised of tax exempt variable rate demand obligations and one using a discount rate based on the libor swap curve  and we applied a risk factor to reflect current liquidity issues in the ars market 
key inputs to our discounted cash flow model include projected cash flows from interest and principal payments and the weighted probabilities of improved liquidity or debt refinancing by the issuer 
we also incorporate certain level market indices into the discounted cash flow analysis  including published rates such as the libor rate  the libor swap curve and a municipal swap index published by the securities industry and financial markets association 
we also considered the probability of default in payment by the issuer of the securities  the strength of the insurance backing and the probability of failure by the insurance carrier in the case of default by the issuer of the securities 
in november  the municipality that issued our impaired ars filed for bankruptcy protection 
we considered these developments  in light of the continued insurance backing  and have concluded the impairment we have maintained remains adequate and temporary 
we do not intend to sell the securities at a loss and we believe we will not be required to sell the securities at a loss in the future 
if auctions involving our ars continue to fail  if issuers of our ars are unable to refinance the underlying securities  if the issuing municipalities are unable to pay their debt obligations and the bond insurance fails  or if credit ratings decline or other adverse developments occur in the credit markets  we may not be able to monetize our securities in the near term and may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these instruments through an impairment charge that may be deemed other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  an impairment provision may be required 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the net book value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values require significant judgment and are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
as a result of assessments performed during fiscal  we recorded million in impairment expense 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment expense of million  primarily related to the decision to write off certain operational assets at one of our foreign locations 
in fiscal  we recorded million in impairment expense 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 

index business combinations we have accounted for all business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
as discussed in more detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we were required to adopt new accounting standards for business combinations commencing after october  however  we have not made any acquisitions to which we were required to apply these new standards 
we have allocated the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
contingent consideration was recorded as a liability when the outcome of the contingency became determinable 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
purchased ipr d  for which technological feasibility has not yet been established and no future alternative uses exist  has been expensed immediately 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the company product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the products when completed  and discount rates 
management estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may cause actual realized values to be different from management estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate other long lived assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discreet financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we had three reporting units to which we allocated goodwill and intangible assets as of september   the date of our annual impairment test 
initially  our company had only one reporting unit and we identified associated goodwill and intangible assets under one reporting unit at that time 
other amounts of goodwill and intangible assets have been attributed to acquired businesses at the time of acquisition through the use of independent appraisal firms 
prior to fiscal  we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis step one analysis of our projected future results 
effective september   we adopted new accounting pronouncements related to our goodwill impairment analysis 
the new accounting guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount step zero analysis 
in fiscal and  we used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill because our cash flows for all of our reporting units continued to show positive trends 
we periodically refresh our step one analysis  so  in fiscal  we used the step one analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units 

index prior to fiscal  the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets was measured using the royalty savings method 
effective september   we adopted new accounting pronouncements related to our indefinite lived intangible assets impairment review 
the new accounting guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unit is less than its carrying amount 
in fiscal  we used this new guidance in our annual impairment review 
we periodically update our future business projections 
consequently  in fiscal  we again used the royalty savings method to determine the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  royalty rates and tax rates  among others 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis that impact these assumptions may result in future impairment charges 
as a result of the review performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets as of september  share based compensation we record share based compensation expense for all share based awards  including stock option grants  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchases 
we calculate share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards ultimately expected to vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience  but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the price volatility of the underlying stock  the expected term of our stock options and the risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options based on a combination of our stock historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
we calculate the expected term of our stock options using historical stock option exercise data  and we add a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement eligible pursuant to their grants during the contractual term of the grant 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards represents the closing price of our common stock on the date of award 
accounting for income taxes current income taxes are determined based on estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
provisions are made for both us and any foreign deferred income tax liability or benefit 
we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
in fiscal and  we elected to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries outside the us rather than repatriating the earnings to the us in fiscal  we elected to permanently reinvest the earnings of all of our foreign subsidiaries 
see the section titled liquidity and capital resources in this md a and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and permanent reinvestment 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into certain unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements on a quarterly basis and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

index effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative operating income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  include certain adjustments to correct prior period amounts  which we have determined to be immaterial to the current period and the prior periods to which they relate 
these adjustments included the correction of a foreign deferred tax asset recorded in the first quarter of fiscal and the correction of additional historical tax accounting recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the correction of the foreign tax asset related to the reversal of a million deferred tax asset for cumulative net operating losses nols associated with our facility in south korea since its opening in  as these nols are expected to be consumed during periods a tax holiday is in effect 
additional tax accounting corrections resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of million and adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet including an increase of million in deferred tax assets  an increase of million in additional paid in capital  a decrease of million in income taxes payable  and a decrease of million in deferred tax liabilities 
collectively  these adjustments reduced net income for fiscal by million and diluted earnings per share for the same period by approximately year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily due to an million increase from a higher priced product mix  partially offset by a million decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes  primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen 
we saw increases in sales of our slurries for polishing aluminum and in our dielectrics slurry product line  partially offset by decreases in revenue in our tungsten slurry  esf and polishing pads product lines 
similar to fiscal  we saw a strengthening of demand in the second half of fiscal after a period of softer demand during the first half of the fiscal year 
we continue to be cautious regarding future demand trends due to uncertainty within the semiconductor industry  compounded by continued macroeconomic uncertainty 

index cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to a million decrease due to the effects of foreign exchange rate changes  primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen  a million decrease in variable manufacturing costs and million in lower fixed manufacturing costs 
these decreases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by a million increase due to a higher cost product mix 
engineered abrasive particles are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
for example  we currently expect higher cost of goods sold on a transitional basis associated with a new contract with an existing supplier 
in addition  a number of factors could impact the future cost of raw materials  packaging  freight and labor 
we also expect to continue to invest in our supply chain to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve our manufacturing product yields 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal  and was above our full year guidance range of to 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the favorable impact of the weaker japanese yen and lower fixed manufacturing costs 
we expect our gross profit percentage for full fiscal year to be in the range of to 
however  we may experience fluctuations in our gross profit due to a number of factors  including the extent to which we utilize our manufacturing capacity  foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in our product mix  which may cause our quarterly gross profit to be above or below this range 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our aip  partially offset by million lower depreciation expense and million in lower product sample costs 
our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp consumable products  including collaboration on joint development projects with key customers  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  technical support of cmp products in our customers development and manufacturing facilities  and  evaluation and development of new polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry 

index selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to million in lower travel related costs and million in lower staffing related costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the absence of million in bad debt expense related to a customer bankruptcy recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  and million in lower professional fees  including the absence of fees we incurred in fiscal associated with our leveraged recapitalization with a special cash dividend 
these decreases were partially offset by million in higher staffing related costs  including costs associated with our aip 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of million from fiscal the increase was due to a full year of interest expense in fiscal recorded on the term loan we entered into in fiscal to partially fund the special cash dividend we paid in fiscal  compared to seven months of interest expense in fiscal other income expense  net other income was million in fiscal compared to other expense of million in fiscal the increase in other income was due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  primarily related to the weakening of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
the increase in other income is net of gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reinstatement of the us research and experimentation tax credit  retroactively effective january   as the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law on january   and a million decrease in income tax expense related to our election to permanently reinvest the earnings of our subsidiaries in japan and south korea 
we recorded approximately million in discrete income tax benefits related to fiscal research and experimentation expenses in the second quarter of fiscal and we recorded million in tax benefits for full fiscal year  subject to actual qualified research and development spending as defined by the law 
these decreases in our effective tax rate during fiscal were partially offset by the recognition of a million foreign tax adjustment related to net operating losses associated with our facility in south korea  as discussed above at the beginning of the results of operations section of this md a  and the recognition of a million valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to a past equity investment in an entity that was legally dissolved during the quarter ended march  as discussed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   our income tax provision in fiscal included various non material adjustments to correct prior period amounts  which resulted in additional income tax expense of million 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage  a lower effective tax rate  the favorable impact of the weaker japanese yen reflected in other income and higher sales 

index year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease in revenue was driven by a million decrease in sales volume and a million decrease due to pricing impacts 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in revenue due to a higher priced product mix and a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
revenue from our polishing pad business increased from fiscal and revenue from our esf business increased slightly 
revenue in fiscal from our tungsten  dielectric  copper and data storage slurry product lines all decreased from fiscal we saw a strengthening of demand in the second half of fiscal after a period of softer demand during the first half of the fiscal year 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million from decreased sales volume  an million decrease due to higher manufacturing yields  and a million decrease due to lower logistics costs 
these decreases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by a million increase due to a higher cost product mix  a million increase due to higher fixed manufacturing costs  including costs at our facility in south korea  and a million increase due to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher fixed manufacturing costs  pricing impacts and decreased sales and production volumes  partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs and higher manufacturing yields 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher expenses for research and development materials and million in higher sample costs  partially offset by million in lower staffing related costs  including costs related to our aip 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to million in lower depreciation and amortization expense and million in lower professional fees  partially offset by million in higher staffing related costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to million in higher bad debt expense  of which million related to a customer bankruptcy filing  and million in higher professional fees  including fees associated with our leveraged recapitalization with a special cash dividend 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower staffing related costs  including costs associated with our aip 

index interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of million from fiscal the increase was due to interest expense recorded on the term loan  as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which was used to partially fund the special cash dividend we paid in fiscal other income expense  net other expense was million in both fiscal and other expense includes million in amortization of prepaid debt costs as well as gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  primarily related to changes in the exchange rate of the japanese yen and the new taiwan dollar to the us dollar  net of the gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due the expiration of the us research and experimentation tax credit effective december   decreased income in certain foreign subsidiaries where we have elected to permanently reinvest earnings  which are taxed at lower rates than in the us  and certain adjustments made to prior year tax estimates 
these increases were partially offset by decreased tax effects on share based compensation and the decreased taxable executive compensation in excess of limits defined in section m of the internal revenue code 
as discussed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   our income tax provision in fiscal included various non material adjustments to correct prior period amounts  which resulted in additional income tax expense of million 
as discussed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   our income tax provision in fiscal included adjustments to correct prior period amounts  including million in tax expense related to executive compensation in fiscal through for which a previous tax benefit should not have been recorded  and the reversal of a million deferred tax asset related to certain share based compensation expense 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  or million  from fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased sales volume coupled with a lower gross profit percentage  increased bad debt expense related to a customer bankruptcy filing  the expenses associated with our leveraged recapitalization with a special cash dividend  increased interest expense and a higher effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   we completed a leveraged recapitalization during our fiscal quarter ended march  in conjunction with this recapitalization  we declared and paid a special cash dividend of per share  or million in aggregate 
we funded the dividend with million from our term loan and million of existing company cash balances 
we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal represented million in net income plus non cash items and a million increase in cash flow due to a net decrease in working capital 
the increase in cash from operations in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to increased net income and decreases in working capital amounts associated with lower inventories and higher accrued liabilities 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to raw material purchases made in the fourth quarter of fiscal associated with a new supply agreement with an existing supplier  which did not repeat in fiscal the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to increased accruals for compensation  including costs associated with our aip 

index we used million in investing activities in fiscal representing purchases of property  plant and equipment 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal of which million represented purchases of property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures in fiscal included the completion of payment for the fiscal construction of our facility in south korea 
we used million in investing activities in fiscal of which million was for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures in fiscal included the majority of costs associated with the construction of our facility in south korea and capacity expansions of our japan and singapore facilities  net of the amounts that remained in accounts payable and accrued expenses at the end of the fiscal year 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
we used million to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program and million to repurchase common stock pursuant to the terms of our second amended and restated cabot microelectronics corporation equity incentive plan eip and our omnibus incentive plan oip for shares withheld from award recipients to cover payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock granted under our eip and oip 
we also used million to repay long term debt

index we entered into a credit agreement in february  which provided us with a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  with sub limits for multicurrency borrowings  letters of credit and swing line loans 
the term loan and revolving credit facility are referred to as the credit facilities 
the credit agreement provides us an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us to request the existing lenders or  if necessary  third party financial institutions to provide additional capacity in the revolving credit facility  in an amount not to exceed million 
the term loan has periodic scheduled principal repayments  however  we may prepay the loan without penalty 
the credit facilities are scheduled to expire on february  the term loan was drawn on february  and the revolving credit facility remains undrawn 
in connection with the credit agreement  we terminated our previously existing million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement contains covenants that restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to take certain actions  including  among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions creating liens  incurring indebtedness  making investments  engaging in mergers  selling property  paying dividends or amending organizational documents 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial ratio maintenance covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of to through june  and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases to to from july  through the termination of the credit agreement 
as of september   our consolidated leverage ratio was to and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was to 
the credit agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default 
we believe we are in compliance with these covenants 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the credit agreement 
as of september   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of which was held in foreign subsidiaries in japan  singapore  south korea and taiwan where we have elected to permanently reinvest the earnings rather than repatriate the earnings to the us if we choose to repatriate these earnings in the future through dividends or loans to the us parent company  the earnings could become subject to additional income tax expense 
we believe that our current balance of cash and long term investments  cash generated by our operations and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  merger and acquisition activities and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  in order to further expand our business  we may need to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
depending on future conditions in the capital and credit markets  we could encounter difficulty securing additional financing in the type or amount necessary to pursue these objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods

index interest expense and fees on long term debt interest payments on long term debt reflect libor based floating rates in effect at september  commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
purchase obligations we have entered into multi year supply agreements with cabot corporation  our former parent company which is not a related party  for the purchase of certain fumed metal oxides 
prior to january   we were generally obligated to purchase fumed silica for at least of our six month volume forecast for certain of our slurry products  to purchase certain minimum quantities every six months  and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than these amounts 
this agreement expired december  we entered into a new fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation that became effective as of january  with an initial term of four years 
this new agreement has revised pricing and requires us to purchase certain minimum quantities of fumed silica each year of the agreement  and to pay a shortfall if we purchase less than the minimum 
the purchase obligations in the table above reflect management expectation that we will meet the minimum purchase quantities each year of the new contract 
we also operated under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  which expired in april  under which we were obligated to pay certain fixed  capital and variable costs  and had certain take or pay obligations

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar and the korean won 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
however  we also incur expenses in foreign countries that are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar  which mitigates the exposure on the consolidated statement of income 
we periodically enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we are unlikely to be able to hedge these exposures completely 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the significant weakening of the japanese yen against the us dollar in fiscal has favorably impacted our gross profit percentage and other income expense on our consolidated statement of income and has significantly impacted accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the weakening of the yen accounted for an approximate basis point increase in our gross profit percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal  as currently our yen denominated cost of goods sold is greater than our yen denominated revenue 
to a lesser extent  we have also seen a favorable foreign exchange impact on our yen denominated operating expenses 
other income has been positively impacted based on the settlement or remeasurement of receivables and payables  including intercompany loans  net of the gains and losses incurred on forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge the yen exposure 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded million in currency translation losses  net of tax  that are included in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
these losses primarily relate to changes in the us dollar value of assets and liabilities transacted in yen when these asset and liability amounts are translated at month end exchange rates 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical additional adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures 
interest rate risk at september   we have million in long term debt at variable interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical basis point increase in our current variable interest rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately million per quarter 
market risk related to investments in auction rate securities at september   we owned two auction rate securities ars with a total estimated fair value of million million par value which were classified as other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in  general uncertainties in the global credit markets significantly reduced liquidity in the ars market  and this illiquidity continues
