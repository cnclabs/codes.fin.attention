item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report to assist in the evaluation of the company s performance 
certain prior period amounts presented in this discussion and analysis have been reclassified to conform to current period classifications 
it should also be read in conjuction with the caution about forward looking statements section at the end of this discussion 
overview currently  the us economy appears to be slowly recovering from one of its longest and most severe economic recessions in recent history 
it is not clear at this time how quickly the economy will recover and whether regulatory and legislative efforts to stimulate job growth and spending will be successful 
in addition  the us housing market continues to struggle from the effects of home price depreciation 
in fiscal years ended december  and  the levels of loan delinquency and defaults were substantially higher than historical levels  however  in december  we completed the sale of commercial loans with a balance of million  which reduced troubled assets by approximately versus september  and approximately versus december  the company s fourth quarter of was profitable  with net income of million  compared to a net loss posted for the fourth quarter of of million 
for the year ended december   a net loss of million was recorded compared to million for the year ended during the year ended december   an evaluation was completed on the net deferred tax asset 
based on forecasted taxable income in the near future  combined with limited tax planning strategies  a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
the company also recorded a full goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
management  in order to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements  is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements are filed with the sec 
as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  the company has identified the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and accounting for income taxes as critical accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the significant reduction of impaired assets during  and the impact the losses had on the allowance for loan losses calculation  management enhanced its methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses as of december   including an adjustment to the established qualitative adjustment factors and the look back period in the determination of the historical loss factor on loans collectively evaluated for impairment 
this refinement resulted in a reduction in the allowance of  at december  management feels the refinement properly reflects the risk inherent in the portfolio at december  see further discussion in note loans receivable and allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future effects of temporary differences and tax credits 
enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the company s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
based upon the company s continued taxable losses  projections for future taxable income and other available evidence  management believed it was not more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized at december   and accordingly  recorded a full valuation allowance of  during the year ended december  readers of the consolidated financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the company s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the company at that time 
corporate profile and significant developments the company is a bank holding company that has elected status as a financial holding company with the frb headquartered in shippensburg  pennsylvania with consolidated assets of  at december  the consolidated financial information presented herein reflects the company and its wholly owned commercial bank subsidiary  the bank 
the bank  with total assets of  at december   is a pennsylvania chartered commercial bank with offices 
the bank s deposit services include a variety of checking  savings  time and money market deposits along with related debit card and merchant services 
lending services include commercial loans  residential loans  commercial mortgages and various forms of consumer lending 
orrstown financial advisors  a division of the bank  offers a diverse line of financial services to our customers  including  but not limited to  brokerage  mutual funds  trusts  estate planning  investments and insurance products 
at december   approximately  of assets under management were serviced by orrstown financial advisors 
economic climate  inflation and interest rates the us economy appears to be slowly recovering from one of its longest and most severe economic recessions in history 
the recovery has been much weaker than past recoveries resulting in stubbornly high unemployment  poor loan demand and continued credit quality challenges 
this pattern remained in place throughout the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  and therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last three years have been modest  and although the federal reserve has been monetizing the debt  which has historically led to increased inflation  the outlook for inflation appears modest for the foreseeable future 
as the company s balance sheet consists primarily of financial instruments  interest income and interest expense is greatly influenced by the level of interest rates and the slope of the interest rate curve 
during the three years presented in this financial statement review  interest rates have remained near all time lows 
because of the low level of interest rates  the company has not been able to lower the rate it pays for interest bearing non maturity deposits to the same extent that has been experienced in the rates we have been able to earn on our interest earning assets 
as a result  the company s net interest margin has been negatively impacted 
despite the challenging economic conditions during  and into  the company believes it is positioned to withstand these conditions through its strong capital and liquidity positions  high quality debt securities portfolios and prudent management of credit and interest rate risk 
results of operations summary for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in and net income of  in  resulting in diluted earnings loss per share of  and for the years  and the company s return on average assets and return on average equity ratios were negative for the years and  compared to and respectively for included in both and s results are significant non cash charges  including the recording of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset of  for the year ended december  and a full goodwill impairment charge of  net of tax  recorded in the fourth quarter of in addition to the nonrecurring deferred tax asset valuation allowance and goodwill impairment charge  the company s performance for the year was also negatively affected by significantly elevated levels of the provision for loan losses which totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  compared to  recorded in the increase in risk assets experienced in  which carried into  including nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and real estate owned  required increases in staff to work through the risk assets and mitigate the company s risk of loss  as well as other noninterest expenses 
net interest income for the year ended december  of  was a  or decline from s total of  this followed a  increase in net interest income in as compared to s total 
an increase in the average level of loans on nonaccrual status  and the shrinking of the balance sheet as the company preserved capital  combined with the low interest rate environment in which proceeds from asset sales and maturities have been reinvested  has put pressure on the company s net interest income and related net interest margin 
on a year to date basis  net interest margin was for the year ended december  compared to and in and net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  is the primary component of the company s revenue 
interest earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowed funds 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the net interest spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the net interest spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
through the use of demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
the analysis of net interest income table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income table below analyzes the changes in net interest income for the same periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a fully tax equivalent basis  decreased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in average earning assets from  in to  in net interest margin decreased basis points  from in to for as summarized on the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income table   of the decline in net interest income was the result of a decrease in average volume  and  of the decrease was the result of average rate 
a large portion of the decline in interest income was the result of a decrease in interest earned on the securities portfolio  which totaled  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from year over year  average securities decreased  or  which contributed  to the overall decline in tax equivalent interest income earned on securities 
as a result of the recent regulatory climate related to nontraditional funding sources  management did not utilize brokered deposits in to the extent it had in the past  and as such  as the brokered deposits matured  securities proceeds were used to fund the payoffs  leading to a decrease in average securities balances during compared to the average yield on investment securities contributed  of the decline in the interest income earned on securities  with the yield earned in of  a basis point decline from that earned in of 
the historic low interest rate environment has resulted in increased financing activity of mortgage loans  resulting in accelerated prepayments on the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  many of which had premiums associated with them 
as the prepayments have accelerated  the amortization of the premiums has been faster than in the past  which has placed pressure on the yields earned on securities 
further  the proceeds from the sales or maturities of securities have been reinvested at lower interest rates  which has also negatively impacted the yield earned on securities 
interest income earned on a tax equivalent basis on loans decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in  a  decline 
several factors contributed to the decline 
the most significant factor contributing to the decline in interest income earned on loans was the decline in the average balance of loans  from  in to  for the year ended december  this decline in average loan balance was the result of management s strategy to temporarily curtail its loan growth in order to address and enhance credit administration and underwriting processes and procedures 
the rates earned on loans also negatively impacted net income during  as the average balance of impaired loans  which generally are in nonaccrual status  increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the increase in loans not accruing interest combined with generally lower interest rates in resulted in the rates earned on loans decreasing from in to in interest expense on deposits and borrowings for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  from the  expensed in the same period in the company s cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities declined from in to for the interest rate environment has allowed the company to lower the rates offered on its demand deposits  including interest bearing demand  money markets and savings accounts in compared to as time deposits and long term debt mature  the company has been able to replace the funds at slightly lower rates 
the company s net interest spread for the year ended december  was  a decrease of basis points compared to the same period in net interest margin for the year ended december  was  a basis point decline from in management anticipates continued pressure on net interest margin in future quarters as the low interest rate environment and our ability to reinvest liquidity into new loans may hinder our ability to grow the margin 
versus for the year ended december  net interest income  measured on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased  or  to  from  in the primary reason for the increase in net interest income was an increase in average earning assets from  in to  in slightly offsetting the growth in volume was a decrease in net interest margin of basis points  from in to for as summarized on the rate volume table   of the growth in net interest income was achieved from volume  offset by a decrease of  attributable to the decrease in rates 
the largest portion of the increase in interest income was the result of interest earned on the securities portfolio  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over year over year  average securities increased  or  and the interest rate earned increased from in to in  each of which contributed to the increase in interest income 
the growth in securities was funded principally through the growth in money market and time deposit accounts 
average interest bearing deposits increased  or  resulting from the company s overall customer service model  its market position in several attractive markets  and due to the favorable rating the bank has received from idc financial publishing  inc idc  an independent bank safety rating agency which uses its unique rankings of financial ratios to determine the quality ratings of financial institutions 
this favorable rating facilitated the company s ability to attract time deposits and brokered deposits  particularly in the first half of the year 
despite an increase in the average balance of time deposits of  for the year ended december  compared to  the total interest expense was lowered by  the average volume resulted in an increase of interest expense of  which was more than offset by a decrease in interest expense of  that resulted from a basis points decrease in the yield paid on time deposits from to the year over year growth in the average loan portfolio also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
year over year  average loans increased  or  from the year ended december  to december  the growth experienced in the loan portfolio in the second half of  supplemented with the loan demand in the first quarter of  provided the strong growth in average loan balances 
the  growth in average balances of loans contributed  in additional interest income in compared to however  the rate earned on loans of was basis points less than in  and offset interest income by  resulting in a net increase of  for the year 
the lower yield earned on loans was the result of generally a lower interest rate environment in than and a greater number of loans on nonaccrual status 
as noted above  the company has been able to increase its deposit base 
part of the increase in the average balance in deposits was the result of certain customers  whose accounts migrated from repurchase agreements and were previously included as short term borrowings in the balance sheet 
these deposits continue to be secured through pledged securities  however  due to regulatory pressure related to non traditional funding sources  which include repurchase agreements  we enhanced our interest bearing demand product to have them migrate to a funding source viewed as more traditional 
this strategy resulted in a decline in the average balance of short term borrowings from  for the year ended december  to  for the company also placed less reliance on more costly long term borrowings in as compared to less reliance on third party borrowings allowed the company to lower its interest expense related to borrowings from  in to  in generally lower interest rates for the year ended december  compared to  combined with an increase in nonaccrual loans  has resulted in the company experiencing declines in net interest spread and net interest margin 
despite the low interest rate environment  the company was able to manage its blend of interest earning assets and liabilities so that the net interest margin has only declined marginally  from for the year ended december  to in analysis of net interest income the following table presents interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest spread and net interest margin for the years ended december dollars in thousands average balance tax equivalent interest tax equivalent rate average balance tax equivalent interest tax equivalent rate average balance tax equivalent interest tax equivalent rate assets federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances taxable securities tax exempt securities total securities taxable loans tax exempt loans total loans total interest earning assets cash and due from banks bank premises and equipment other assets allowance for loan losses total liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities demand deposits other total liabilities shareholders equity total net interest income fte net interest spread net interest margin tax equivalent adjustment net interest income note yields and interest income on tax exempt assets have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a tax rate

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled  a  or  decrease from  for several factors contributed to the decrease in the provisioning requirements between periods 
a priority of the company has been to work through its nonaccruing loans and other risk elements  in an attempt to reduce the level of these underperforming assets 
the company s focus on asset quality remediation  including loan workouts  additional structural enhancements  and multiple sales of non performing assets to third parties have driven significant improvement in asset quality metrics  including decreases in levels of nonaccrual loans and restructured loans  and decreases in the percentage of nonaccrual loans and restructured loans to total loans outstanding 
nonaccrual loans declined from  or of total loans outstanding  at december  to  or of total loans outstanding  at year end as a result  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans increased from at december  to at december  as a result of remediation efforts in  including two separate sales of distressed assets  and extensive loan reviews of non classified assets  management believes that it has been able to significantly reduce the credit risk profile of the company to one that is more comparable with peers 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses balance reflects the company s improved risk profile 
accordingly  the company s provision for loan losses was lower in than in in  management recognized that its credit quality had deteriorated significantly  as evidenced by increases in nonaccrual loans from  at december  to  at december   and increases in restructured loans from  at december  to  at december  also  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding in increased to  from in the identification of a significant number of classified loans  many of which were reclassified to nonaccrual status during  resulted in a significant increase in the provision for loan losses from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  see further discussion in the asset quality and credit risk management sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
noninterest income the following provides information regarding noninterest income changes over the past three years 
dollars in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees trust department income brokerage income mortgage banking revenue earnings on life insurance merchant processing revenue other income subtotal before securities gains securities gains losses total noninterest income v 
s results noninterest income decreased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  in the same prior year period 
excluding the decrease in securities gains of  in compared to  noninterest income decreased  or 
the company sold its merchant processing business in the third quarter of  which contributed  in revenues for the year ended december   including the recognition of a gain of  in  income recognized on merchant services consisted of amounts previously held back as gain until all conditions of the sales contract were satisfied 
noninterest income for the twelve months ended december  was favorably influenced by the sale of interest rate swaps of  with no similar gains occurring in in  two of the company s non margin lines of business posted increases in revenues 
mortgage banking revenue was favorably influenced by the continued low interest rate environment  coupled with greater stability in the real estate market 
mortgage banking revenues totaled  for the year ended december   a increase over orrstown financial advisors  which generates trust and brokerage income  recorded revenues of  for the year ended december   a  or increase over the same period in favorable market conditions  combined with new business opportunities  led to the enhanced revenue stream 
service charges on deposit accounts and other services charges  commissions and fees totaled  and  for the year ended december   both declines of from s totals 
the company has experienced a decline in overdraft charges and other fee related charges  as consumers are more conscious of their spending 
the company continued to harvest gains on securities available for sale when it was strategically determined that the gains afforded on certain securities were more beneficial than the interest rate earned 
additionally  asset liability management as well as maintaining capital levels factored into the decision as to the extent and timing of security gains taken during the year 
net gains on securities were  for the year ended december  compared to  in v 
s results noninterest income increased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  in the same prior year period 
excluding the increase in securities gains of  in compared to  noninterest income increased 
significant fluctuations between years include the following other service charges  commissions and fees of  for the year ended december   declined  or  from the same period in the primary reason for the decline is due to ancillary loan fees being down  which include late fees  letter of credit fees  and prepayment fees 
this trend downward was consistent with the company s slowing down of its loan growth and the increased level of loans that moved to nonaccrual status 
trust department and brokerage income increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to as a result of increases in trust and brokerage activity as the stock market continued its recovery  and additional trust and brokerage assets under management were added 
the continued decline in mortgage interest rates led to an increase in new mortgage loan applications as well as refinancing activities in the increase in activity resulted in increases in mortgage banking revenues to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  in in the third quarter of  the company sold its merchant service business  which resulted in a gain of approximately  and is included in merchant processing revenue 
the recognition of this gain is the primary reason for the increase in merchant processing revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in included in other income for the twelve months ended december  was the gain on the sale of two fixed for prime floating rate swaps which totaled  and is consistent with the  earned in upon the sale of one interest rate swap 
the company sold securities at net gains of  for the year ended december   compared to  in asset liability management as well as maintaining capital levels factored into the decision to take security gains 
noninterest expenses the following provides information regarding noninterest expense over the past three years 
change dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense furniture and equipment data processing telephone advertising and bank promotions fdic insurance professional services collection and problem loan real estate owned expenses taxes other than income goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortization other operating expenses total noninterest expenses v s results noninterest expenses decreased from  during the twelve months of to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
excluding the nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge of  recorded in  noninterest expenses would have increased  or  as compared to the following contributed to the net decrease in noninterest expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the increase in salaries and employee benefits is the result of the establishment of the company s special assets group to assist in working through troubled assets  increases in personnel in the credit administration department  and other additions as the company enhanced other risk management practices 
the decrease in data processing expenses from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in is related to expenses associated with merchant processing that are no longer incurred 
as noted in the noninterest income section above  the company sold its merchant services business in data processing expenses of  were incurred for the year ended december  related to these revenues with no similar charges in fdic insurance totaled  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  over s total of  this increase is the result of an increased risk rating and associated increased depository insurance rate  which has been partially offset by a reduction in the bank s net assets and deposits 
professional services expenses totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  in  a decrease of  professional services expenses include costs associated with third party loan review assistance  regulatory consulting  legal and accounting services 
in  when the company first began experiencing asset quality issues and increased regulatory compliance costs  it needed to consult with outside service providers as the company did not have adequate staffing to address these issues 
as the special assets group  credit administration department  and other risk management personnel were hired  the company was able to reduce its reliance on outside service providers for this expertise  which resulted in lower professional service fees in as compared to collection and problem loan expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december  and totaled  compared to  for these expenses have increased as a result of the increase in classified assets with corrective action and work out plans in order to mitigate the company s risk of loss  and consists primarily of costs associated with obtaining updated appraisals on the collateral securing the outstanding loans and legal expenses as the bank s credit exposure is clarified and work out plans are developed 
real estate owned expenses  which includes regular maintenance and upkeep expenses as well as write downs of properties to fair value less costs to dispose  increased from  for the year ended december   to  in  an increase of 
the increase is consistent with the higher number of properties that the company owns and is managing  as well as continued softness in the real estate market  which led to further write downs of properties 
the largest decrease was in goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortization  which totaled  for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge in connection with its annual evaluation of goodwill 
the impairment charge resulted from several factors  the most prominent being decreases in trading multiples of the company s common stock  overall valuations of comparable organizations  a deterioration in asset quality of the commercial real estate portfolio  and the negative impact of deteriorating asset quality on expected cash flows 
as a result of these negative indicators and subsequent analysis  the company s entire goodwill balance was written off at december  the  of expense in is the amortization of intangible assets only 
other operating expenses decreased  for the year ended december   from  in to  in the primary reason for this fluctuation is the difference in the provision for off balance sheet credit liabilities recorded between the two periods 
off balance sheet credit liabilities include providing a reserve on undrawn loan commitments  and the anticipated loss on those credits which are estimated using an approach similar to determining reserves on specific loans in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
during  a charge of  was recorded to establish this off balance sheet reserve  whereas in  the reserve was lowered by  as the off balance sheet exposures have been greatly reduced as a result of the two loan sales completed in in order to better understand how noninterest expenses change in relation to related changes in revenue  operating expense levels are often measured in the financial services industry by the efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expense as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and noninterest income  excluding securities gains  goodwill impairment  and other non recurring items 
as a result of the increase in noninterest expense net of goodwill impairment  combined with declining net interest income  the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december  increased to  compared to in the same period in the company anticipates the efficiency ratio will remain slightly elevated as it addresses regulatory matters and remaining asset quality issues 
v 
s results as a result of the growth the company experienced during the first half of combined with an increase in classified assets  regulatory issues  and accounting complexities  noninterest expenses rose from  during the twelve months of to  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
excluding the nonrecurring goodwill impairment charge of  other expenses would have totaled  an increase of over s results 
the following contributed to the net increase in other expenses 
salaries and employee benefits decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in employee benefit accruals based on the company s performance  including discretionary executive bonuses  profit sharing accruals and stock compensation awards 
offsetting the reduction in these accruals was a growth in the number of full time equivalents from at december  to at december  fdic insurance totaled  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  or  over the increase is the result of additional deposits that the bank has been able to generate in  combined with higher assessment rates in than those charged in professional services totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in expenses can be attributed to increased utilization of professional services  and new services outsourced to third party providers 
collection and real estate owned expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december  and totaled  compared to  for these expenses increased as a result of the increase in classified assets with corrective action and work out plans 
the largest increase was in goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortization  which totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the increase was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of  slightly offset by lower amortization of other intangibles 
other operating expenses increased  for the year ended december   from  in to  in included in other operating expenses is a provision for off balance sheet reserves totaling  in with no corresponding charge in in light of the downturn in real estate conditions  a reserve was established in for loan commitments  principally on construction loans  that have not yet been funded 
in addition  the company experienced its first losses on loans sold with recourse in the secondary market under the fhlb of chicago s mpf program 
each loan that is sold under the program is credit enhanced 
for the year ended december   the company foreclosed or is in the process of foreclosing on loans sold under the mpf program  with a resulting charge of  included in other operating expenses representing an estimate of the company s losses under its recourse exposures 
the remainder of the increase in other expenses is primarily the result of the growth experienced by the company 
federal income taxes the company recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  offset by an income tax benefit of  for a total income tax expense of  for the year ended december   compared to total income tax benefit of  in and total income tax expense of  in the primary reason for the fluctuation in income tax expense or benefit is due to changes in the levels of pre tax income loss for the period  combined with the valuation allowance on deferred taxes recorded in a meaningful comparison is the effective tax rate  a measurement of income tax expense as a percent of pretax income  which is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income  life insurance earnings and tax credits associated with low income housing and historic projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
the effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and the negative effective tax rate in was due to the valuation allowance that was recorded for the year  which resulted in tax expense despite a pre tax loss 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of to the effective tax rate for each of the years ended december   and in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers taxes paid in prior years  projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies  and other factors in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income  projections for future taxable income over the periods and other available evidence  management believed it was not more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized at december  accordingly  a valuation allowance for the net amount of the deferred tax assets  or  which represented future deductible temporary differences on our tax returns  was established at december   compared to no valuation allowance at december  financial condition a substantial amount of time is devoted by management to overseeing the investment of funds in loans and securities and the formulation of policies directed toward the profitability and minimization of risk associated with such investments 
securities available for sale the company utilizes securities available for sale as a tool for managing interest rate risk  enhancing income through interest and dividend income  to provide liquidity and to provide collateral for certain deposits and borrowings 
as of december   securities available for sale were  an  decrease from the december  balance of  the company has established investment policies and an asset management policy to assist in administering its investment portfolio 
decisions to purchase or sell these securities are based on economic conditions and management s strategy to respond to changes in interest rates  liquidity  securitization of deposits and repurchase agreements and other factors while obtaining the maximum return on the investments 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the company may segregate its investment portfolio into three categories securities held to maturity  trading securities and securities available for sale 
management has classified the full securities portfolio as available for sale 
securities available for sale are to be accounted for at their current market value with unrealized gains and losses on such securities to be excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in other comprehensive income 
the company s securities available for sale include debt and equity instruments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk 
this risk arises from general market conditions  factors impacting specific industries  as well as corporate news that may impact specific issues 
management continuously monitors its debt securities  including updates of credit ratings  monitoring market  industry and segment news  as well as volatility in market prices 
the company uses various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired  including the extent of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position  and the extent of the unrealized loss 
in addition  management assesses whether it is likely the company will have to sell the security prior to recovery  or if it is able to hold the security until the price recovers 
for those debt securities in which management concludes the security is other than temporarily impaired  it will recognize the credit component of an other than temporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income 
given the strong asset quality of the debt security portfolio  management has not had to take an other than temporary impairment charge in  or for equity securities  when the company has decided to sell an impaired available for sale security and does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover before the expected time of sale  the security is deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when the impairment is deemed other than temporary even if a decision to sell has not been made 
the company recorded no other than temporary impairment expense on equity securities for the years ended december   and the following table shows the fair value of securities available for sale at december dollars in thousands us treasury us government sponsored enterprises gse states and political subdivisions gse residential mortgage backed securities total debt securities equity securities totals the securities available for sale portfolio declined from  at december  to  at december  the state and political subdivisions portfolio has declined from of the total securities portfolio at december  to of the portfolio at december  many of the revenue bonds were sold during the year ended december  and reinvested in u

both the decline in the total securities portfolio and the shift in investment types  are consistent with the company s strategy to reduce its risk weighted assets in order to strengthen its capital ratios 
in  the securities available for sale portfolio declined  or  as compared to  which was the result of the cash flows received from principal pay downs  maturities  and sales of securities  in order to meet the funding needs of maturing borrowings and deposits  including time deposits discussed further in the deposit products section below

loan portfolio the company offers various products to meet the credit needs of our borrowers  principally consisting of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  and retail loans consisting of loans secured by residential properties  and to a lesser extent  installment loans 
no loans are extended to non domestic borrowers or governments 
with certain exceptions  we are permitted under applicable law to make loans to single borrowers including certain related persons and entities in aggregate amounts of up to of the sum of total capital and the allowance for loan losses 
the company s legal lending limit to one borrower was approximately  at december  the risks associated with lending activities differ among the various loan classes  and are subject to the impact of changes in interest rates  market conditions of collateral securing the loans  and general economic conditions 
all of these factors may adversely impact the borrower s ability to repay its loans  and impact the associated collateral 
the company has various types of commercial real estate which have differing levels of credit risk associated with them 
owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business  with the cash flows generated from the business being the primary source of repayment of the loan 
if the business suffers a downturn in sales or profitability  the borrower s ability to repay the loan could be in jeopardy 
non owner occupied and multi family commercial real estate loans and non owner occupied residential properties present a different credit risk to the company than owner occupied commercial real estate  as the repayment of the loan is dependent upon the borrower s ability to generate a sufficient level of occupancy to produce rental income that exceeds debt service requirements and operating expenses 
lower occupancy or lease rates may result in a reduction in cash flows  which hinder the ability of the borrower to meet debt service requirements  and may result in lower collateral values 
the company generally recognizes that greater risk is inherent in these credit relationships as compared to owner occupied loans mentioned above in its loan pricing 
acquisition and development loans consist of family residential construction and commercial and land development loans 
the risk of loss on these loans is largely dependent on the company s ability to assess the property s value at the completion of the project  which should exceed the property s construction costs 
during the construction phase  a number of factors could potentially negatively impact the collateral value  including cost overruns  delays in completing the project  competition  and real estate market conditions which may change based on the supply of similar properties in the area 
in the event the collateral value at the completion of the project is not sufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance  the company must rely upon other repayment sources  including the guarantors of the project or other collateral securing the loan 
commercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short term working capital  machinery and equipment financing  and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans 
although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers  the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower s accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment 
in a significant number of these loans  the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner s personal real estate or assets 
commercial and industrial loans present credit exposure to the company  as they are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy  as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk through its underwriting standards  including evaluating the credit worthiness of the borrower and to the extent available  credit ratings on the business 
additionally  monitoring of the loans through annual renewals and meetings with the borrowers are typical 
however  these procedures cannot eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending 
municipal loans consist of extensions of credit to municipalities and school districts within the company s market area 
these loans generally present a lower risk than a commercial and industrial loan  as they are generally secured by the municipality s full taxing authority  or by revenue obligations  or its ability to raise assessments on its customers for a specific utility 
the company originates loans to its retail customers  including fixed rate and adjustable first lien mortgage loans with the underlying family owner occupied residential property securing the credit 
the company s risk exposure is minimized in these types of loans through the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including credit scores and debt to income ratios  and underwriting standards which limits the loan to value ratio to generally no more than upon loan origination  unless the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance 
home equity loans  including term loans and lines of credit  present a slightly higher risk to the company than family first liens  as these loans can be first or second liens on family owner occupied residential property  but can have loan to value ratios of no greater than of the value of the real estate taken as collateral 
the credit worthiness of the borrower is considered including credit scores and debt to income ratios  which generally cannot exceed 
installment and other loans credit risk are mitigated through conservative underwriting standards  including the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including credit scores and debt to income ratios  and if secured  the collateral value of the assets 
as these loans can be unsecured or secured by assets the value of which may depreciate quickly or may fluctuate  they typically present a greater risk to the company than family residential loans 
as of december   in recognition of the changing risk profile within the loan portfolio  the company enhanced the manner in which it segregated its loan portfolio  including an increase in the number of loan classes  to assist in properly capturing the credit risk in each of the loan classes 
these loan classes are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
in light of charge offs in and  it is believed that the identification of specific historical losses and qualitative factors related to each loan class allows the company to better reflect the estimated credit risk in these portfolios which aids in the establishment of the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  as of december   two new additional loan classes were separately broken out  including non owner occupied residential and municipal loan portfolios which were previously included in the commercial and industrial loan classification 
the financial information for december    and is presented with the expanded loan classifications 
the loan portfolio  excluding residential loans held for sale  broken out by classes as of december is as follows dollars in thousands december  december  december  december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans the loan portfolio as of december   generally broken down by the underlying security of the loans  is as follows dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total loans in addition to the company monitoring its loan portfolio as segregated by loan class noted above  it also monitors concentrations by industry 
the bank s lending policy defines an industry concentration as one that exceeds of the bank s shareholders equity 
the following industry meet the concentration criteria defined by the bank s lending policy at december  dollars in thousands balance of total loans of bank s equity hotels except casinos the loan portfolio at december  of  decreased  from  at december  the company s desire to improve its asset quality resulted in its disposal of a portion of its distressed asset portfolio during  with an aggregate carrying balance of  during in addition  elevated charge off levels were experienced in the commercial loan portfolio during  primarily in the non owner occupied  owner occupied and commercial and land development portfolios 
the company also curbed its new loan originations in order to focus on current portfolio analysis and maintenance and to enhance credit administration and underwriting processes and procedures 
given the softness in the economy within the company s footprint  management feels this was a prudent course of action in order to rehabilitate its loan portfolio 
also  due to longer term interest rate risk considerations  the company continues to sell its longer term residential mortgage loans  as it is not willing to take on the interest rate risk in this environment 
presented below are the approximate maturities of the loans by type  and whether they are fixed rate or adjustable rate loans as of december  due in one year or less year through five years after five year total dollars in thousands acquisition and development family residential construction fixed rate adjustable and floating rate total commercial and land development fixed rate adjustable and floating rate total commercial and industrial fixed rate adjustable and floating rate total the variable rate loans shown above include semi fixed loans that contractually will adjust with prime after the interest lock period which may be up to years 
at december  there were approximately  of such loans 
asset quality risk elements the company s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through the company s underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also mitigate the company s risk of credit loss 
the company s loan portfolio is principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and washington county  maryland 
as the majority of loans are concentrated in this geographic region  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
in addition  loans past due days or more and still accruing are also deemed to be risk assets 
for all loan classes  the accrual of interest income ceases when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is inadequate to cover principal and interest or immediately if  in the opinion of management  full collection is unlikely 
interest will continue to accrue on loans past due days or more if the collateral is adequate to cover principal and interest  and the loan is in the process of collection 
interest accrued  but not collected  as of the date of placement on nonaccrual status  is generally reversed and charged against interest income  unless fully collateralized 
subsequent payments received are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal 
loans are returned to accrual status  for all loan classes  when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current  the loans have performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the note for a reasonable period of time  generally six months  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured 
past due status is based on contract terms of the loan 
loans  the terms of which are modified  are classified as troubled debt restructurings if a concession was granted  for legal or economic reasons  related to a debtor s financial difficulties 
concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a temporary deferral of scheduled loan payments  an extension of a loan s stated maturity date  temporary reduction in interest rates  or below market rates 
if a modification occurs while the loan is on accruing status  it will continue to accrue interest under the modified terms 
nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if scheduled principal and interest payments  under the modified terms  are current for six months after modification  and the borrower continues to demonstrate its ability to meet the modified terms 
troubled debt restructurings are evaluated individually for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year  or if they are not performing according to their modified terms

during  the company continued to actively identify and monitor nonperforming assets and other risk assets  and has acted aggressively to address the credit quality issues 
risk assets  defined as nonaccrual loans  restructured and loans past due days or more and still accruing  and real estate owned  declined from  at december  to  at december   an improvement of  the risk element that showed the greatest percentage decline was restructured loans still accruing  which totaled  at december   a  or decline from december  during  the company received payments payoffs on restructured loans totaling  and charged off  in connection with loan workouts 
additionally   of restructured loans migrated to nonaccrual status either due to missed payments or the company s determination that the borrowers would not be able to keep their payments current for a sustainable period of time 
offsetting these declines were  in loans restructured during the period 
nonaccrual loans at december  totaled  a decrease of  from december  s balance of  the company s focus on asset quality restoration  including loan workouts  additional information gathered from borrowers or additional structural enhancements  and sales of non performing assets to third parties has driven this significant reduction over year end one strategy employed by the company in to reduce its level of non performing loans included two bulk sales of distressed assets  one each in the second and fourth quarters of the bulk sales allowed the company to sell nearly loans with an aggregate carrying balance of  to third parties  which netted the company  in cash proceeds 
the difference between the carrying balance of the loans sold and the cash received  or  was recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  at december   a  decrease from december  as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans was  a decrease from at december  despite the lower allowance for loan losses balance  and lower ratio to outstanding loans  the allowance to loan losses coverage ratio of nonaccrual loans and restructured loans has increased substantially 
the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans and restructured loans still accruing increased to at december   from at december  the increase in the coverage ratios reflects lower levels of risk assets  particularly the significant decrease in non performing assets discussed above 
a priority of the company is to continue to work through its nonaccrual loans and other risk elements  in an attempt to reduce the levels of these underperforming assets 
as new information is learned about borrowers or updated appraisals on real estate with lower fair values are obtained  the company may continue to experience additional impaired loans 
through increased human resources allocated to credit related issues  the company believes it can continue to mitigate its risk of loss  and to reduce its level of nonaccrual and classified loans 
as of december   the company had approximately lending relationships that had loans that were considered impaired  and were included in the impaired loan balance of  of these relationships  have outstanding book balances in excess of  totaling  or of the total impaired loan balance 
in connection with the determination of the impairment associated with these five collateral dependent relationships  partial charge offs on relationships totaling  were taken and another  of asc impairment reserves were recorded on the balances at december  these impairment reserves are in contrast to  in impairment reserves on nonaccrual loans at december  in  the company began taking partial charge offs on collateral dependent loans whose carrying value exceeded their estimated fair value  as determined by the most recent appraisal adjusted for current within the quarter conditions  less costs to dispose 
prior to  the fair value that was used was based on the most recent appraised value of the loans  and any additional discounts determined to be appropriate based on current within the quarter conditions  plus costs to dispose  were separately reserved for and not included in the partial charge off 
as a result of this more conservative approach  the accumulated partial charge offs as of december  increased over december  asc impairment reserves remain in those situations in which updated appraisals are pending  and represent management s estimate of potential loss 
the largest impaired relationship that the company has had a book balance of approximately  at december   is a wholesaler that supplies inventory to the commercial construction industry 
as a result of the deterioration in real estate conditions  the borrower s business has been negatively impacted  leading management to conclude that it will be unable to continue to service its debt requirements 
the relationship also includes financing for a residence 
based on recently obtained appraisals  impairment charges  and partial charge offs representing of the outstanding december  loan balance have been taken 
the borrower has filed for bankruptcy  and the company is working with legal counsel to liquidate the collateral 
a second relationship that the company has determined to be impaired at december  is with a real estate developer who also actively leases residential properties and operates trailer parks 
this relationship consists of separate loans with total outstanding book balances of  secured by different parcels of land or residential structures 
recent appraisals on the collateral securing the outstanding loans received during resulted in the relationship being placed in nonaccrual status  as the softening of real estate prices and rental prices  and the lengthening of absorption periods resulted in it being classified and evaluated as a collateral dependent impaired loan 
to date  partial charge offs or specific reserves of approximately of the outstanding loan balances have been taken 
the company is actively working with the borrower to reduce its outstanding loan balances 
an additional relationship  which has a book balance in excess of nearly  is with a contractor whose business has been negatively impacted by the slow residential construction market 
as a result of the deterioration in real estate conditions  volumes have decreased which has had a negative impact on the borrower s cash flow 
as a result  it was determined the borrower would not be able to continue its debt service requirements 
as of december   however  the borrower is current with respect to scheduled payments 
the company is still in the process of determining the fair value of the collateral securing the related loans  and has established a preliminary asc reserve on this relationship totaling approximately of the overall outstanding loan balance at december  another relationship that includes impaired loans is with a real estate developer that was developing townhomes to be sold to interested parties 
due to the softness in the real estate market and longer absorption periods to sell the townhomes  the properties were converted to residential properties that are being leased 
updated appraisals were obtained in june on the units  and partial charge offs totaling approximately of the legal balance of the loans were taken 
the borrower has been uncooperative with the company  which has resulted in the bank exercising its right to assignment of the leases  and collection of rental payments directly from the tenants of the properties 
the company is pursuing foreclosure action or a possible loan sale 
the final relationship that includes impaired loans and had a balance of approximately  is with a borrower that purchased a large parcel of land in the company s market area 
the loan is current with respect to the interest only payment requirements 
since there have been no sales to date  and several extension requests  the loan was placed in nonaccrual status 
due to the guarantee of this debt by several development authorities  combined with a strong loan to value ratio  no partial charge offs or specific reserves have been established on this loan as of december  the company has approximately additional relationships with borrowers that include loans that are individually evaluated for impairment  and has taken a similar approach to those mentioned above in determining the extent of full or partial charge offs that were required  or asc reserves that may be needed 
the determination of the company s charge offs or impairment reserve determination properly included an evaluation of the outstanding loan balance  and the related collateral securing the credit 
through a combination of collateral securing the loans and partial charge offs taken to date totaling  the company believes that it has adequately provided for the potential losses that it may incur on these relationships as of december  however  over time  additional information may become known that could result in increased reserve allocations or  alternatively  it may be deemed that the reserve allocations exceed those that are needed 
the company s foreclosed real estate balance of  at december  reflects a decrease from  at december  as of december   properties were owned by the company  eight of which were commercial properties and totaled  and two of which were residential properties and totaled  the largest commercial property is a commercial land parcel with a carrying value of  a second commercial property with a carrying value of  was originally purchased by the company for future expansion purposes 
during  it was determined that this property was no longer in the company s strategic plans  and as such  the company re designated the property as held for sale 
the largest residential property has a carrying balance of  at december  and is being carried at a value lower than a recent sales offer on the property 
the remaining properties have carrying values less than  and are also carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less costs to dispose 
as of december   the company believes the value of foreclosed assets represents their fair values  but if the real estate market continues to remain soft  additional charges may be needed 
credit risk management allowance for loan losses the company s charge offs have increased in the past two years  reflective of sluggish economic and real estate conditions 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses utilizing a defined methodology  which considers specific credit evaluation of impaired loans  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management believes the approach properly addresses the requirements of asc section for loans individually identified as impaired  and asc subtopic for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  and other bank regulatory guidance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in order to monitor ongoing risk associated with its loan portfolio and specific credits within the segments  management uses an eight point internal grading system 
the first four rating categories  representing the lowest risk to the bank  are combined and given a pass rating 
management generally follows regulatory definitions in assigning criticized ratings to loans  including special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
the special mention category includes loans that have potential weaknesses that may  if not monitored or corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s position at some future date 
these assets pose elevated risk  but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe  or classified rating 
substandard loans are classified as they have a well defined weakness  or weaknesses that jeopardize liquidation of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
substandard loans include loans that management has determined not to be impaired  as well as loans considered to be impaired 
a doubtful loan has a high probability of total or substantial loss  but because of specific pending events that may strengthen the asset  its classification of loss is deferred 
loss assets are considered uncollectible  as the underlying borrowers are often in bankruptcy  have suspended debt repayments  or ceased business operations 
once a loan is classified as loss  there is little prospect of collecting the loan s principal or interest and it is generally written off 
the bank has a loan review policy and program which is designed to mitigate risk in the lending function 
the credit administration committee  comprised of executive officers and loan department personnel  was charged with oversight of the overall credit quality and risk exposure of the company s loan portfolio 
effective december   the credit administration committee was merged into the enterprise risk management committee erm committee 
from that date forward the erm committee is responsible for the oversight of the overall credit quality and risk exposure 
this includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all bank personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
the loan review program provides the bank with an internal through an outsourced third party beginning in  independent review of the bank s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
generally  consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass categories unless a specific action  such as extended delinquencies  bankruptcy  repossession or death of the borrower occurs  which heightens awareness as to a possible credit event 
loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of  loan review documentation is submitted to the erm committee no less than quarterly with a formal review and rating as presented by independent loan review personnel 
in addition  all relationships rated substandard  doubtful or loss are reviewed by the erm committee on a quarterly basis  with reaffirmation of the rating as approved by the bank s loan work out committee or loan review staff 
in addition to the policy and procedure guidelines noted above  the company expanded its review coverage during the last three quarters of in light of softness in overall economic conditions and deterioration of underlying collateral securing lending relationships 
as a result  all commercial real estate  construction and development loans  and commercial loans in excess of  representing over coverage of these portfolios  have been reviewed 
the following summarizes the bank s ratings based on its internal risk rating system as of december dollars in thousands pass special mention non impaired substandard impaired substandard doubtful total december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans potential problem loans are defined as performing loans  which have characteristics that cause management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as non performing loans in the future 
generally  management feels that substandard loans that are currently performing and not considered impaired  result in some doubt as to the borrower s ability to continue to perform under the terms of the loan  and represent potential problem loans 
additionally  the special mention classification is intended to be a temporary classification  and is reflective of loans that have potential weaknesses that may  if not monitored or corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s position at some future date 
special mention loans represent an elevated risk  but their weakness does not yet justify a more severe  or classified rating 
these loans require follow up by lenders on the information that may cause the potential weakness  and once resolved  the loan classification may be downgraded to substandard  or alternatively  could be upgraded to pass 
classified loans may also be evaluated for impairment 
for commercial real estate  acquisition and development and commercial and industrial loans  a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
generally  loans that are more than days past due are deemed impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed to determine if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual status 
nonaccrual loans in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are  by definition  deemed to be impaired 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  construction and restructured loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral 
for loans that are deemed to be impaired for extended periods of time  periodic updates on fair values are obtained  which may include updated appraisals 
the updated fair values will be incorporated into the impairment analysis as of the next reporting period 
in the event an updated appraisal that requires a higher impairment reserve is received after a reporting period  but prior to the issuance of the financial statements  an evaluation is made as to the significance of the difference and whether the amounts need to be reflected in the financial statements not yet issued 
loan charge offs  which may include partial charge offs  are taken on an impaired loan that is collateral dependent if the loan s carrying balance exceeds its collateral s appraised value  the loan has been identified as uncollectible  and it is deemed to be a confirmed loss 
typically  impaired loans with a charge off or partial charge off will continue to be considered impaired  unless the note is split into two  and management expects the performing note to continue to perform and is adequately secured 
the second  or non performing note  would be charged off 
as of the periods presented  the company has no loans to borrowers that resulted from splitting impaired loans into multiple notes 
generally  an impaired loan with a partial charge off may continue to have an impairment reserve allocated to it after the partial charge off  if factors warrant 
as of december  and december   nearly all of the company s impaired loans extent of impairment was measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the credit  except for troubled debt restructurings 
by definition  troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired 
all restructured loans impairment was determined based on discounted cash flows for those loans classified as troubled debt restructurings but are accruing interest 
for real estate loans  collateral generally consists of commercial real estate  but in the case of commercial and industrial loans  it would also consist of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or other business assets 
commercial and industrial loans may also have real estate collateral 
according to policy  updated appraisals are required annually for classified loans in excess of  the as is value provided in the appraisal is often used as the fair value of the collateral in determining impairment  unless circumstances  such as subsequent improvements  approvals  or other circumstances dictate that another value provided by the appraiser is more appropriate 
generally  impaired loans secured by real estate were measured at fair value using certified real estate appraisals that had been completed within the last year 
appraised values are further discounted for estimated costs to sell the property and other selling considerations to arrive at the properties fair value 
in those situations in which it is determined an updated appraisal is not required for loans individually evaluated for impairment  fair values are based on one or a combination of the following approaches 
in those situations in which a combination of approaches is considered  the factor that carries the most consideration will be the one management believes is warranted 
the approaches are as follows original appraisal if the original appraisal provides a strong loan to value generally or lower and  after consideration of market conditions and knowledge of the property and area  it is determined by the credit administration staff that there has not been a significant deterioration in the collateral value  the original certified appraised value may be used 
discounts as deemed appropriate for selling costs are factored into the appraised value in arriving at fair value 
discounted cash flows in limited cases  discounted cash flows may be used on projects in which the collateral is liquidated to reduce the borrowings outstanding  and is used to validate collateral values derived from other approaches 
collateral on certain impaired loans is not limited to real estate  and consists of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or other business assets 
estimated fair values are determined based on borrowers financial statements  inventory ledgers  accounts receivable agings or appraisals from individuals with knowledge in the business 
stated balances are generally discounted for the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets 
in determining fair value  liquidation discounts are applied to this collateral based on existing loan evaluation policies 
the company distinguishes substandard loans on both an impaired and non impaired basis  as it places less emphasis on a loan s classification  and increased reliance on whether the loan was performing in accordance with the contractual terms 
substandard classification does not automatically meet the definition of impaired 
a substandard credit is one that is inadequately protected by current sound worth  paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
extensions of credit so classified have well defined weaknesses which may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits  does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard 
as a result  the company revised its methodology in its evaluation of certain accruing commercial real estate  acquisition and development and commercial and industrial loans rated substandard collectively for impairment as opposed to evaluating these loans individually for impairment 
although we believe these loans have well defined weaknesses and meet the definition of substandard  they are generally performing and management has concluded that it is likely it will be able to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
larger groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
generally  the bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
the following summarizes impaired loans by class  segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not required as of december  and in the first quarter of  the company began to more aggressively charge off specific reserve allocations on impaired loans rather than carry related allowances 
at december   specific reserves were related to anticipated closing costs  additional market discounts on appraised values and specific reserves identified during periods subsequent to the balance sheet 
allowances established at december  generally pertain to those credits in which loan forbearance agreements were in the process of being negotiated  or updated appraisals are pending  and the partial charge off will be recorded when final information is received

in the second quarter of  the company adopted the provisions of asu no 
 a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring asu no 

as a result of adopting the amendments in asu no 
 the company reassessed terms and conditions to customers on restructured loans that had been completed in the past several months 
in many instances  the company was able to increase the interest rate on the loans and obtain additional collateral support for the borrowings  in exchange for extension of the loans terms 
however  the new interest rate charged was considered to be at a below market rate given the risk of the transaction  which was determined to be a concession to its borrowers that were experiencing financial difficulties 
prior to their classification as troubled debt restructurings  these loans had been collectively evaluated for impairment consistent with the guidance in subtopic upon identifying these receivables as troubled debt restructurings  the company identified them as impaired under the guidance in section the amendments in asu no 
require prospective application of the impairment measurement guidance in section for those receivables newly identified as impaired 
as a result of the adoption  earnings were negatively impacted by  representing the impairment valuation reserve at december  calculated under section previous to the adoption of asu no 
 a reserve was established on these loans under a general allowance methodology

troubled debt restructurings included in nonaccrual status at december  were designated as such either due to the borrower defaulting on modified terms within the past twelve months  or management s determination that the borrower would not be able to continue to meet debt service requirements for a sustainable period of time or where newly restructured debts had not yet reached a minimum of six months of performance according to modifications 
as of december   loans totaling  were in default under their restructured terms 
no additional commitments have been made to borrowers whose loans are considered troubled debt restructurings

the following table presents the classes of loan portfolio summarized by aging categories of performing loans and nonaccrual loans as of december days past due current still accruing total past due non accrual total loans december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans during the fourth quarter of  the company took a more conservative position on loans days past due still accruing  and generally now will include them as nonaccrual loans unless the loan principal  in full  is in the process of collection  which is generally defined as days 
as a result of this more conservative approach in light of deteriorating asset quality  there are no loans in the days past due still accruing category at december  and in connection with its quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management continually reviews its methodology to determine if it continues to properly address the risk in the loan portfolio 
for each loan class presented above  general allowances are provided for loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  which is based on quantitative factors  principally historical loss trends for the respective loan class  adjusted for qualitative factors 
prior to  historical loss factors were applied to non impaired criticized loans only 
in  historical loss factor was based on an average of charge offs for the last eight quarters and applied to the entire pool of loans  excluding those loans evaluated for impairment under asc in addition  an additional adjustment to the historical loss factors is made to account for delinquency and other potential risk not elsewhere defined within the allowance for loan and lease loss methodology 
in response to the improved risk profile within the loan portfolio at december   the look back period for historical losses was extended to quarters  weighted one half for the most recent four quarters  and one quarter for each of the two previous four quarter periods in order to appropriately capture the loss history in the loan segment 
again  management considered current economic and real estate conditions  and the trends in historical charge off percentages that resulted from applying partial charge offs to impaired loans  and the impact of distressed loan sales during the year 
based on management s assessment and in compliance with regulatory guidance  the company began recording partial charge offs on collateral dependent loans in the first quarter of  eliminating the need for specific reserves 
although both methods are acceptable under asc  the revised method is more consistent with regulatory directives and was implemented by the company resulting in increased charge offs during this change in estimate to the quarter weighted average approach allowed for lower reserve levels by  at december  in addition to the quantitative analysis  adjustments to the reserve requirements are allocated on loans collectively evaluated for impairment based on additional qualitative factors 
as of december   the qualitative factors used by management to adjust the historical loss percentage to the anticipated loss allocation  which may range from a minus basis points to a positive basis points per factor  include nature and volume of loans loan growth in the current and subsequent quarters based on the bank s targeted growth and strategic plan  coupled with the types of loans booked based on risk management and credit culture  and number of exceptions to loan policy  supervisory loan to value exceptions etc 
concentrations of credit and changes within credit concentrations factors considered include the bank s overall portfolio makeup and management s evaluation related to concentration risk management and the inherent risk associated with the concentrations identified 
underwriting standards and recovery practices factors considered include changes to underwriting standards and perceived impact on anticipated losses  trends in the number of exceptions to loan policy  supervisory loan to value exceptions  and administration of loan recovery practices 
delinquency trends factors considered include the delinquency percentages noted in the portfolio relative to economic conditions  severity of the delinquencies  and whether the ratios are trending upwards or downwards 
classified loans trends factors considered include the internal loan ratings of the portfolio  the severity of the ratings  and whether the loan segment s ratings show a more favorable or less favorable trend  and underlying market conditions and its impact on the collateral values securing the loans 
experience  ability and depth of management lending staff factors considered include the years of experience of senior and middle management and the lending staff and turnover of the staff  and instances of repeat criticisms of ratings 
quality of loan review factors include the years of experience of the loan review staff  in house versus outsourced provider of review  turnover of staff and the perceived quality of their work in relation to other external information 
national and local economic conditions ratios and factors considered include trends in the consumer price index cpi  unemployment rates  housing price index  housing statistics compared to the prior year  bankruptcy rates  regulatory and legal environment risks and competition 
prior to december   qualitative factors were also utilized in the determination of loans collectively evaluated for impairment  but consisted of only five factors  which are included in the eight factors listed above  with anticipated loss allocations that ranged from basis points 
it was determined that the qualitative adjustments would be expanded to the current range of a minus basis points to a positive basis  as the prior range of basis points was deemed to be too restrictive and did not adequately address the credit improvement in the remaining loan portfolio 
this change in estimate in the range of qualitative adjustments resulted in reduced general reserves by approximately  at december  activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december   and is as follows commercial consumer dollars in thousands commercial real estate acquisition and development commercial and industrial municipal total residential mortgage installment and other total unallocated total december  balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of period december  balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of period december  balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries balance  end of period a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses  for the years ended before december  based on the prior approach  is as follows dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate mortgage consumer total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries provision for loan losses balance  end of year a summary of relevant asset quality ratios for the five years ended december  are as follows ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding provision for loan losses to net charge offs ratio of reserve to gross loans outstanding at december due to the trends in the national and local economies  as well as declines in real estate values in the company s market area  the allowance for loan losses continued to grow for the period from through  consistent with the increase in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses decreased from  at december  to  at december  net charge offs increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   with the majority of the charge offs coming in the commercial real estate and commercial and land development loan portfolios 
the provision for loan losses has decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in  a decrease of  several factors contributed to the decrease in the provision requirements between the two periods  including the reduction in nonaccrual loans from  at december  to  at december  as a result of remediation efforts in  including two separate sales of pools of distressed assets  combined with extensive loan reviews of non classified assets  management believes that it has been able to significantly reduce the credit risk profile of the company 
the lower provision for loan losses is reflective of these favorable developments 
see further discussion in the provision for loan losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses  as well as the percent of each loan type in relation to the total loan balance  is as follows amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans amount of loan type to total loans commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied multi family non owner occupied residential acquisition and development family residential construction commercial and land development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage first lien home equity term home equity lines of credit installment and other loans unallocated dollars in thousands amount of loan type to total loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer unallocated total the following summarizes the ending loan balance individually or collectively evaluated for impairment based upon loan type  as well as the allowance for loan loss allocation for each at december dollars in thousands commercial real estate acquisition and development commercial and industrial municipal residential mortgage installment and other unallocated total december  loans allocated by individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment allowance for loan losses allocated by individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment december  loans allocated by individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment allowance for loan losses allocated by individually evaluated for impairment collectively evaluated for impairment the allowance for loan losses allocations presented above represent the reserve allocations on loan balances outstanding at december in the respective years 
in addition to the reserve allocations on impaired loans noted above  approximately loans  with outstanding general ledger principal balances of  have had cumulative partial charge offs to the allowance for loan losses recorded totaling  as updated appraisals were received on collateral dependent loans  partial charge offs were taken to the extent the loans principal balance exceeded their fair value 
management believes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan segments adequately reflects the inherent risk in each portfolio  and is based on the methodology previously discussed 
as previously noted  in and management re evaluated and made certain enhancements to its methodology used to establish a reserve to better reflect the risks inherent in the different segments of the portfolio  particularly in light of increased charge offs  with noticeable differences between the different loan segments 
management believes these enhancements to the allowance for loan losses methodology improves the accuracy of quantifying losses presently inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the reserve and bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
a large component of the reserve for the last two years has been allocated to the non owner occupied residential portfolio  which is consistent with this portfolio having the largest amount of impaired loans at both december  and the reserve allocated to non owner occupied residential loans has declined from  at december  to  at december   consistent with the lower level of impaired loans  which declined from  to  during this period 
similarly  the non owner occupied commercial real estate s reserve allocation continues to represent a sizable portion of the total allowance for loan losses at december  and totaled  or of the total balance 
the reserve allocation declined  from december  s balance of  consistent with the decrease in impaired loans from  to  at december  and  respectively 
the reserve allocation on the residential loan portfolio  in total  has increased from  at december  to  at december  this increase is consistent with generally higher balances of impaired loans in the first lien and line of credit categories 
in addition  some softening in the residential real estate market has led to increased qualitative reserves established on this portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
this reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocation  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions and other factors management believes appropriate at the time 
the unallocated portion of the allowance has increased in from  at december  to  at december  and represents of the entire allowance for loan losses balance at december   compared to at december  while management believes the company s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  regulatory guidance  or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
future adjustments to the reserve and enhancements to the methodology may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  regulatory guidance or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
deposit products on an average daily basis  total deposits were  in  a decrease of  or  from in  the average daily balance increased compared to despite a decline in total deposits  the company experienced growth in each of its core funding sources  including non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and saving deposits 
given current economic times and market conditions  it has been noted that consumers are saving more and with the low interest rate environment  they are less willing to invest their funds in certificates of deposits 
in addition  the company experienced growth in its interest bearing demand deposits  as state and municipal subdivisions that had previously elected to be in the company s repurchase agreement product  migrated to an interest bearing demand deposit  secured by investment securities 
average time deposits were  in  a decrease of  or  compared to the average balance in this is in contrast to the increase of  in average time deposits in compared to the fluctuation in time deposit balances reflects different growth strategies in each of the past two years 
in the first half of  the company was growing its loan and asset balances  and was able to grow its time deposits  which funded asset growth 
in the latter half of and in  the company s growth strategy changed as it experienced significant credit losses 
as the company began to re engineer its loan origination and credit administration processes and procedures to better manage credit risk  loan growth slowed significantly which allowed the company to enhance its procedures and maintain its capital ratios 
this change in strategy in the latter half of that continued throughout reduced the need for time deposits 
in addition  the company has slowed its brokered deposit offerings as well 
the average balance of brokered time deposits decreased from  for the year ended to  in  which is included in time deposits above 
management continually evaluates its utilization of brokered deposits  and considers the interest rate curve and regulatory views on non core funding sources  and balances this funding source with its funding needs based on growth initiatives 
as the company feels it has worked through a majority of its credit quality issues  it expects to begin to grow its loan portfolio in the average amounts of deposits are summarized below for the years ended december dollars in thousands demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits the following is a breakdown of maturities of time deposits of  or more as of december  dollars in thousands total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through one year over one year total short term borrowings in addition to deposit products  the company also uses short term borrowings as a funding source 
the largest component of short term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase with deposit customers  in which the customer sweeps a portion of its deposit balance into a repurchase agreement  which is a secured borrowing as a pool of securities are pledged against the balances 
information concerning securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of and for the years ended december is as follows dollars in thousands balance at year end average balance during the year average interest rate during the year maximum month end balance during the year securities underlying the agreements at year end carrying value estimated fair value additional short term borrowing sources include borrowings from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  federal funds purchased  and to a lesser extent  the federal reserve discount window and the federal reserve s term auction facility taf  which the company participated in during early information concerning the use of these other short term borrowings as of and for the years ended december is summarized as follows dollars in thousands balance at year end average balance during the year average interest rate during the year maximum month end balance during the year long term debt the company also utilizes long term debt  consisting principally of federal home loan bank fixed and amortizing advances to fund its loan and security portfolios 
as of december   long term debt totaled  which was  less than s year end balance of  the net decrease in long term debt was the result of pay downs during the year with no additional advances 
during the year  the company s reliance on long term debt diminished as the decline in long term commercial loans reduced the company s need for longer term funding 
the company will continue to evaluate its funding needs and interest rate movements in its evaluation as to the timing and extent of when it enters into long term borrowings 
capital adequacy and regulatory matters capital resources 
the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to its stockholders while maintaining sufficient levels of capital and related risk based regulatory capital ratios to satisfy statutory regulatory requirements 
the company s capital management strategies have historically been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to its shareholders  while maintaining a well capitalized position of regulatory strength 
total shareholders equity decreased  from  at december  to  at december  the primary reason for the decline in shareholders equity was the  loss for the year ended december  combined with unrealized losses on securities available for sale  net of tax of  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to financial holding companies 
capital adequacy 
in the determination of tier and total risk based capital  generally accumulated other comprehensive income loss is excluded from capital  as are intangible assets  a portion of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that is dependent on future taxable income greater than one year from the reporting date 
as of december   of the company s deferred tax asset had been disallowed for tier or total risk based capital 
as of december   the company provided a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset  which reduced the deferred tax asset  excluding other comprehensive income items  to zero 
the valuation allowance of  negatively impacted tier and total risk based capital through the charge to earnings 
the net loss of  was the primary reason capital ratios declined from december  the allowance for credit losses  including the allowance for loan losses and reserve for off balance sheet credit commitments  is included as tier capital to the extent it does not exceeds of risk weighted assets 
the amount that exceeds of risk weighted assets  is disallowed as tier capital  but also reduces the company s risk weighted assets 
as of december  and   and  of the allowance for credit losses was excluded from tier capital 
the lower disallowed amount in was the result of the elevated charge offs during the year which essentially eliminated specific reserves on impaired loans and decreased the allowance for loan losses 
regulatory capital 
as of december   the bank was considered well capitalized under applicable banking regulations 
the company s and the bank s capital ratios as of december  and were as follows actual minimum capital requirement minimum to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risk weighted assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank tier capital to risk weighted assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank tier capital to average assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank december  total capital to risk weighted assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank tier capital to risk weighted assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank tier capital to average assets orrstown financial services  inc   n a n a orrstown bank as noted above  the bank s capital ratios exceed those to be considered well capitalized under applicable banking regulations 
the company routinely evaluates its capital levels in light of its risk profile to assess its capital needs 
in march  the company and the bank entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia and the bank entered into a consent order with the pennsylvania department of banking 
in accordance therewith  the bank has filed a capital plan with each of those banking regulators 
in october  the company announced it had discontinued its quarterly dividend  which was the result of regulatory guidance from the federal reserve indicating that the company s dividend application would not be approved 
due to the regulatory restrictions included in the written agreement and the consent order with the respective regulators  the company is restricted from paying any dividends or repurchasing any stock without prior regulatory approval 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to pay a cash dividend or conduct any stock repurchases in the near future 
additional relevant financial information pertaining to shareholders equity for the years ended december is as follows dollars in thousands average shareholders equity net income loss cash dividends paid equity to asset ratio dividend payout ratio return on average equity liquidity and rate sensitivity liquidity 
the primary function of asset liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and manage the company s sensitivity to changing interest rates 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities  the sale of mortgage loans and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
at december   we had  in loan commitments outstanding  which included  in undisbursed loans   in unused home equity lines of credit and  in commercial lines of credit  and  in standby letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled  or of certificates of deposit 
the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  which increased from  at december  the higher levels of cash and cash equivalents is due to the proceeds received from the loan sale at the end of the year  combined with investing these funds in the federal reserve s interest bearing deposit account  to help strengthen risk based capital and liquidity ratios 
securities classified as available for sale  net of pledging requirements  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled  at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately  from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb  of which we had  in advances and  in letters of credit outstanding at december  on that date  we had no overnight advances outstanding 
the company s ability to borrow from the fhlb is dependent on having sufficient qualifying collateral  generally consisting of mortgage loans 
in the second quarter of  the fhlb notified the bank that all borrowings from the fhlb must be secured with acceptable collateral  consisting principally of eligible loans and securities 
the fhlb takes delivery of the collateral 
the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders 
the company also has repurchased shares of its common stock 
the company s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
for restrictions on the bank s ability to dividend funds to the company  see note  restrictions on dividends  loans and advances  to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity management requires the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
management  through its alco process  attempts to manage the level of repricing and maturity mismatch so that fluctuations in net interest income is maintained within policy limits in current and expected market conditions 
the company has consistently followed a strategy of pricing assets and liabilities according to prevailing market rates within the guidelines of sound marketing and competitive practices 
rate spreads will be sacrificed at times in order to enable the overall rate sensitivity position to stay within the guidelines called for by asset liability management policy 
rate sensitivity is measured by monthly gap analyses  quarterly rate shocks  and periodic simulation 
investment and pricing decisions are made using both liquidity and sensitivity analyses as tools 
contractual obligations the company enters into contractual obligations in its normal course of business to fund loan growth  for asset liability management purposes  to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes

off balance sheet arrangements the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and to a lesser extent  letters of credit

interest rate sensitivity management requires the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company has consistently followed a strategy of pricing assets and liabilities according to prevailing market rates within the guidelines of sound marketing and competitive practices 
interest earning assets are substantially made up of loans and securities 
loans are priced by management with current market rates as guidelines while achieving a positive interest rate spread and limiting credit risk 
a significant part of the loan portfolio is made up of variable rate loans and loans that will become variable after a fixed term and will reprice as market rates move 
securities are purchased using liquidity and projected cash flows as guidelines 
the deposit base is a mix of transaction accounts and time deposits 
many of the interest bearing transaction accounts have discretionary pricing and in market conditions where normal levels of interest rates prevail  the company has historically had greater flexibility for deposit side price adjustments 
in the current period of extraordinarily low interest rates  the company s flexibility in pricing interest bearing transaction accounts has been greatly diminished 
time deposits have set maturities as do short term and long term borrowings

beginning with the march  period  it was determined that three quarters of interest bearing deposits would be classified to reprice in the month time horizon  versus one quarter as was done at december  the principle reason for this change in methodology is due to the large amount of municipal checking accounts as we have experienced increased bid situations due to the low interest rate environment 
the company has maintained its liquidity in interest bearing deposits in banks  included in the other category 
given the low interest rate environment  management feels that rates are more likely to rise than fall  and is the reason the company has allowed its liquidity to build up during many of the interest bearing deposits that are variable rate are subject to discretionary pricing so management retains flexibility with those funds which will enhance earnings in a rising rate environment 
the majority of the loan portfolio is tied to prime  but the use of three to seven year rate locks as well as placing rate floors on any new loans helps to maintain the yield in a falling rate environment 
further discussion related to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included under the heading of liquidity and rate sensitivity in item of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management closely monitors the fiscal and monetary policies of our government and acts in anticipation of changes in order to maintain a healthy earning asset interest bearing liability balance
