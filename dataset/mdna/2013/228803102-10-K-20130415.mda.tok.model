th street was organized as a blank check company for the purpose of acquiring  through a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase  reorganization  exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction  one or more operating businesses or assets 
following the transaction discussed above in item of part i of this annual report on form k  in october  th street changed its name to crumbs bake shop  inc to reflect the nature of its business more accurately 
cbs  through its consolidated subsidiary  holdings  engages in the business of selling a wide variety of cupcakes  cakes  cookies and other baked goods under the trade name crumbs bake shop as well as hot and cold beverages under the we proudly service starbucks coffee program 
cupcake sales have historically comprised the majority of crumbs business 
crumbs believes its baked goods appeal to a wide demographic of customers who span a broad range of socio economic classes 
crumbs operates in commercial and residential sections of urban and suburban markets 
recently  crumbs has expanded into key super regional shopping malls in the new hampshire to virginia corridor and in chicago  illinois 
as of december   there were crumbs bake shop stores operating in nine states and washington  dc  including stores in manhattan  new york 
of the total stores  were opened in crumbs sales are primarily conducted through its stores in new york  new jersey  california  illinois  connecticut  washington  dc  massachusetts  delaware  pennsylvania  and virginia 
a small percentage of baked goods sales are from crumbs wholesale distribution business  catering services and crumbs e commerce division at http www 
crumbs 
com which ships cupcakes nationwide 
recent initiatives in an effort to maximize overall profitability and stockholder value  management continuously evaluates store performance and the effectiveness of and outlook for crumbs growth strategies 
when necessary  management seeks to formulate and implement changes that it believes will correct weaknesses in store operations that could be causing declining sales results 
in addition  management may revise  scale back or accelerate crumbs growth strategies to reflect market conditions  operating performance and cash available for growth 
operating performance at a number of crumbs stores has declined during the months ended december  during the last year  management has identified and instituted six key initiatives which it believes will improve the overall financial performance of crumbs  bolster the image of the crumbs brand  and position crumbs to grow in a more predictable and profitable manner 
these initiatives contemplate special attention being paid to corporate structure  supply chain management  identification of real estate opportunities relating to existing and new stores  the frequent introduction of new cupcakes  and a wide  sweeping improvement in customer interaction 
management believes that the success of these initiatives is dependent  in part  on a shift in strategy from in line stores to mall based stores  better placement of new stores  and the closure of underperforming stores for which management believes the performance outlook is unfavorable 
in an effort to maximize the benefits that management believes can be achieved from these initiatives  management decided to accelerate the timing of new store openings in in october  to fund this growth strategy  cbs consummated a private placement of common stock in which it received gross proceeds of approximately million the capital transaction 
the capital transaction is further discussed below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations and known trends crumbs results of operations as a percentage of net sales and variances between and are discussed in the following sections 
net loss for the year ended december  crumbs recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or basic and diluted net loss per common share of  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or basic and diluted net loss per common share of  for the year ended december  net sales on january  there were stores in the comparable store base  with additional stores entering the base during the year  for a total of stores at december  same store sales represent the change in sales for stores after their th full calendar month of operation 
net sales in were million  an increase of over million in this increase was primarily attributable to million in sales from new stores opened between november  and december  the increase was offset by a million decrease in same store sales for stores in the same store sales base  including partial periods from new stores that entered the same store sales base during the year 
the decrease in same store sales was predominately due to negative effects of locating new stores in close proximity to existing stores  resulting in a reduction in sales in same stores previously opened 
management believes that more consistent introduction of new cupcakes  improvements in the quality of store personnel and a centralized automated ordering system on which it is currently working will lead to improvements in same store sales 
stores that are too close together may attract customers within a common trading area  and  as a result  a new store that is not appropriately located may have the effect of decreasing same store sales at a pre existing store 
although management attempts to position new stores so that their impact on existing stores will be minimized  it is impossible to predict certain customers shopping patterns 
as such  management s decisions in this regard are based on various assumptions and judgments that may prove to be inaccurate and or may be impacted by the materialization of known or unknown risks and uncertainties

for scheduled rent escalation clauses during lease terms or for rent payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  crumbs records minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
this treatment results in a non cash expense in the early years of these leases that reverses in the later years of the leases

general economic trends and seasonality crumbs results of operations are generally affected by the economic trends in its market areas due to the dependence on its customers discretionary spending 
weakness in the national economy and or regional economies in its market areas  combined with other factors including inflation  labor and healthcare costs and availability of suitable locations for its stores  may negatively impact its business 
if consumer activities associated with the consumption of its products decline or the business activities of its corporate customers decrease  its net sales and sales volumes may decline 
crumbs results to date have not been significantly impacted by inflation 
while crumbs business is not highly seasonal  it is impacted by weather 
extreme hot  cold and wet weather may cause decreased sales in the affected stores  especially street locations  and could impact the daily delivery of its baked goods 
in addition  crumbs sales peak throughout the year on certain holidays events such as valentine s day  easter  mother s day  halloween  thanksgiving  christmas and hanukkah particularly in the mall locations 
the timing of these holidays events in a particular year could impact quarterly results 
hurricane sandy resulted in the loss of approximately days of business number of stores times number of days of business during october and november resulting in an estimated loss of approximately million of net sales 
in  crumbs received and recorded million in insurance recoveries related to the business interruption losses caused by the hurricane 
management anticipates that crumbs may receive additional minimal recoveries but cannot estimate when these recoveries will be received or their amounts 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the merger in  cbs contributed approximately million to holdings 
on october   cbs sold approximately million shares of its common stock to accredited investors in the capital transaction 
cbs received gross proceeds of approximately million in the capital transaction 
after paying expenses  net proceeds of approximately million were available to fund future store growth and provide additional working capital 
in addition to the cash received in the merger and the capital transaction  holdings primary source of liquidity has been  and is  cash from the sale of cupcakes and other baked goods and beverages 
holdings primary uses of cash are cost of sales  operating expenses and capital expenditures  including expenditures associated with the construction and opening of new stores 
as of december   crumbs had approximately million in cash and other current assets  net of current liabilities  which could be used to fund store growth and working capital needs  compared to million at december  our growth strategy is aggressive  and our current level of cash and other assets may not be sufficient to fully implement our growth strategy without significantly increasing our revenues in the future periods 
in that case  the company would need to obtain additional capital or scale back the implementation of our growth strategy 
on april   in an effort to increase the resources available to fund this strategy  cbs entered into a binding term sheet  dated april   with an accredited investor relating to the potential sale by cbs of not less than million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured convertible promissory notes in a private placement transaction 
the term sheet does not obligate the parties to consummate the transaction  but requires them to use their good faith best efforts to negotiate  finalize  execute and deliver definitive agreements relating to the transaction 
there can be no assurance that cbs will successfully negotiate and enter into these definitive agreements or consummate the transaction 
see the risk factor in item a of part i of this annual report entitled  we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available on acceptable terms 
and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for further information about this potential transaction 
cash flows crumbs net cash used in operating activities in was million compared to million in the increase in operating cash outflows in was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses in excess of the increase in gross margins for the period 
this increase in cash outflows was partially offset by receivable collections  the consistency of inventory levels from to and the reduction of prepaid rent payments made at the time of lease signings 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in investing cash outflows in consisted primarily of costs related to new stores  construction in progress related to nine stores and corporate computer equipment purchases 
in  investing cash outflows consisted primarily of costs related to new stores  construction in progress related to six stores and million for the purchase of certificates of deposit used as security for letters of credit issued to several landlords in lieu of security deposit payments 
as noted above  the capital transaction provided a cash inflow of million in  and the merger provided a cash inflow of million in contractual obligations crumbs contractual obligations relate to operating leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for a discussion of crumbs operating lease commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements crumbs has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates crumbs describes its significant accounting policies in note of its consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires crumbs to makes estimates  judgments and assumptions  which it believes to be reasonable  based on the information available 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
crumbs believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates require management s most subjective judgment in making estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  crumbs evaluates long lived assets for impairment 
crumbs first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is calculated based on the asset s estimated fair value 
the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future store revenue and operating costs  using internal projections 
cash flows for store assets are identified at the individual store level 
long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount  or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
estimates of future cash flows can be significantly impacted by many factors  including operating costs  competition and consumer and demographic trends 
a change in the projections used to determine future cash flows or a change in judgment regarding the ability to use tangible personal property in alternate locations could alter the impairment amounts recognized 
lease obligations 
crumbs leases stores and office space under operating leases 
most lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses  and some contain contingent rent provisions  tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays 
many leases also contain renewal options 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  crumbs uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when crumbs enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for its intended use and excludes future renewal periods 
crumbs also depreciates leasehold improvements over the lesser of an asset s useful life or the term of the lease  excluding future renewal periods 
if crumbs changed its estimates by including renewal options in its calculations  rent expense and depreciation expense would differ 
revenue recognition 
crumbs stores recognize revenue when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenue from crumbs catering services and wholesale distribution business is recognized once goods are delivered  and revenue from crumbs e commerce division is recognized once goods are shipped 
revenue is reported net of sales  use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities 
revenue from crumbs gift cards and certificates are recognized when tendered for payment  or upon redemption 
outstanding customer balances are included in gift cards and certificates on the consolidated balance sheets 
there are no expiration dates on crumbs gift cards and certificates  and crumbs does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances 
income taxes 
crumbs complies with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts  based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
at the date of the merger  crumbs recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million for the estimated income tax effect of the increase in tax basis of the purchased interests and future projected payments under the tax receivable agreement 
crumbs recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million based on its estimation of projected future taxable income 
a change in estimation of projected future taxable income would likely result in a different valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements crumbs has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of any recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations
