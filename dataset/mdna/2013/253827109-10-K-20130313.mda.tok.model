table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth previously under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are one of the largest national providers of in office nuclear cardiology imaging and ultrasound services to physician practices  hospitals and imaging centers through our digirad imaging solutions dis business segment 
we also sell medical diagnostic imaging systems including solid state gamma cameras for nuclear cardiology and general nuclear medicine applications  as well as provide service on the products we sell 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are sold in both portable and fixed configurations  and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras or our single or dual headed cameras 
our nuclear cameras fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital  eg  emergency and operating rooms 
we generate revenues within two primary operating segments dis and diagnostic imaging 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive diagnostic imaging services program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera or ultrasound equipment for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging  echocardiography  vascular ultrasound  or any combination of these procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform imaging in the physician s office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis diagnostic imaging service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
dis services are primarily provided to cardiologists  internal medicine physicians and family practice doctors who enter into annual contracts for our diagnostic imaging services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to five times per week 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to vacations  holidays and inclement weather 
we have been experiencing a significant market change due to the decline in reimbursements to our physicians and the uncertainty with healthcare legislation 
this market change may require further adjustments to our business model in order for our physician customers and us to maintain a viable economic model 
our diagnostic imaging segment revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices and hospitals primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
on february   we announced a plan to restructure our diagnostic imaging business to significantly reduce costs  including a reduction in force 
after completion of this planned restructuring  we believe the overall operating cash flow of the company will increase 
however  it is also likely that the long term volume and total revenue of our diagnostic imaging camera sales will decrease 
further  we are assessing as part of the restructuring effort if we will continue to manufacture our products internally or outsource manufacturing to a third party  and to what extent we will continue to manufacture our products 
this restructuring will result in certain charges that will be incurred during the quarter ending march   and throughout our fiscal year we anticipate the restructuring will be substantially complete by december  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of cardiologists  internal medicine physicians  family practice physicians  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear and ultrasound diagnostic imaging procedures 
during the year ended december   we provided imaging services through dis to more than physicians and physician groups 
we have sold over cameras through our diagnostic imaging segment 
more than half of our dis nuclear and ultrasound diagnostic imaging customers are internal medicine physicians or other primary care practitioners  and the remainder are primarily cardiologists 
our market has been negatively affected by lower physician reimbursements from the center for medicare and medicaid services cms and third party providers for the codes under which our physician customers bill for our services  pricing pressures  decreases in radiopharmaceutical isotope supplies and continuing efforts by some third party payers to reduce health care expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications 
we have been addressing and will continue to address these market pressures by modifying our dis business model  and assisting our physician customers in complying with new regulations and requirements 

table of contents trends and drivers the medical device industry  including the market for nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services  is highly competitive 
our business continues to be affected by many factors  including healthcare reimbursement rates for cardiac imaging procedures  competition from alternative imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography pet and computed tomography ct angiography  competition from other small owner operated mobile nuclear imaging providers  declining average selling prices for our product offerings and general uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace 
we continue to experience significant market changes due to the fluctuations in reimbursement rates and the uncertainty of healthcare legislation 
we also continue to experience a low demand for our cameras  partially due to very limited hospital and physician group capital budgets and the general low economic recovery rate 
based on our recent restructuring announcement  we expect most of these trends to continue in the foreseeable future 
in our dis segment  our physician customers continue to experience significant uncertainty in reimbursements from cms and third party providers for the codes under which our physician customers bill for our services 
this uncertainty has caused some of our physician customers to sell their practices to a hospital and others to reduce the volume of our service 
as a result  we are continuing to modify our offering and pricing for our services upon contract renewal 
the uncertainty over the enactment of future legislation that may impact reimbursement rates continues to linger and cause concern with our physician customers 
we continue to consider modification to our business model in order to adapt to environmental and regulatory changes in our dynamic healthcare marketplace 
in our diagnostic imaging segment  we continue to focus on single photon emission computed tomography  or spect  products targeted specifically at the larger physician practices and hospital marketplace 
the most widely used imaging acquisition technology utilizing gamma cameras is single spect  and all of our current cardiac gamma cameras employ spect methodology 
although the national electrical manufacturers association has reported that the dedicated cardiac nuclear market has declined by approximately percent since  according to industry sources despite the improving image quality and increasing utilization rates of competing modalities such as ct  pet  and mri  and diagnostic procedures such as ct angiography  spect procedures performed with gamma cameras will continue to be used for a substantial number of cardiac specific imaging procedures 
we believe continued utilization will be driven by patients having easier access to nuclear medicine services at physicians offices  lower purchase and maintenance costs  a smaller physical footprint  and easier service logistics of gamma cameras 
in an emerging trend in cardiology  spect technologies are being integrated with other imaging modalities to form hybrid imaging modalities  such as spect ct  resulting in improved clinical quality and diagnostic certainty 
on february   we announced a plan to restructure our diagnostic imaging business to significantly reduce costs  including a reduction in force 
after completion of this restructuring  it is likely that the long term volume and total revenue of our diagnostic imaging camera sales will decrease 
further  we are assessing as part of the restructuring effort if we will continue to manufacture our products internally or outsource manufacturing to a third party  and to what extent we will continue to manufacture our products 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
financial highlights our consolidated revenues were million for the year ended december  this was a decrease of million  or  over the comparable prior year period 
dis revenue decreased million  or  primarily due to a reduction in the number of days we scanned for our physician customers coupled with a reduction in our average daily service fee rates 
the number of scan days was reduced due to a consolidation in the number of scan days by our physician customers in response to reimbursement uncertainty  in addition to other business factors such as physician pre certification requirements  making it more difficult for our physician customers to utilize our services 
diagnostic imaging segment revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  compared to the prior year period  primarily due to the product mix of cameras sold coupled with a decline in camera pricing related to market pricing pressures 
the number of cameras sold increased to from during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we realized a loss from operations and a net loss for the year ended december  primarily as a result of decreased revenues and gross profit 
our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was million  which is an increase of million  or  compared to our net loss of million during the prior year 
the dis segment generated an operating loss primarily as a result of an anticipated settlement related to radiopharmaceutical litigation 
the operating loss in the diagnostic imaging segment was primarily attributable to lower gross profit due to the product mix of cameras sold and increased excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of the restructuring plan discussed in further detail in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
our dis business currently operates in states 
for the year ended december   dis operated nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems 
we continue to strive to improve our overall profitability through more efficient 
table of contents utilization of our fleet of gamma cameras and ultrasound equipment 
we measure efficiency by tracking system utilization  which is measured based on the percentage of days that our nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound equipment are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services 
system utilization increased to for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of equipment in operation during the year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from providing in office services to support the performance of cardiac diagnostic imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition  when all of the following four criteria are met i a contract or sales arrangement exists  ii products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  iii the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition is based upon factors such as passage of title and risk of loss  the need for installation  and customer acceptance 
these factors are based on the specific terms of each contract or sales arrangement 
dis revenue is derived from our ability to provide our physician customers with our services  which includes use of our imaging system  qualified personnel  and related items required to perform imaging in their own offices and bill medicare  medicaid and other payors for in office nuclear and ultrasound diagnostic imaging procedures 
revenue related to diagnostic imaging services is recognized at the time services are performed and collection is reasonably assured 
dis diagnostic imaging services are generally billed on a per day basis under annual contracts for nuclear diagnostic imaging  which specifies the number of days of service to be provided  or on a flat rate month to month basis for ultrasound imaging 
diagnostic imaging product revenues are generated from the sales of gamma cameras and follow on maintenance service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery to customers 
we also provide installation and training for camera sales in the united states 
installation and training is generally performed shortly after delivery and represents a cost which we accrue at the time revenue is recognized 
neither service is essential to the functionality of the product 
maintenance services are sold beyond the term of the warranty  which is generally one year from the date of purchase 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation and is included in diagnostic imaging product sales 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
we review reserves on a quarterly basis and make adjustments based on our historical experience rate and known collectability issues and disputes 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectability could be impacted by material amounts due to changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
within dis  we record adjustments and credit memos that represent billing adjustments within the first days subsequent to the performance of service 
a provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and a provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as we only have a small number of customer accounts in both dis and diagnostic imaging that have receivable balances in excess of inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value and review our inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead and variance costs 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
per our policy  we generally reserve of the cost of inventory quantities in excess of a defined period of demand 
once inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold or disposed 
fair value of financial instruments 
table of contents the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value for accounting purposes  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements 
the guidance defines fair value as an exit price  which is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
assets and liabilities with readily available  actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and require less judgment in measuring fair value 
conversely  assets and liabilities that are rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are generally measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency of the asset  liability or market and the nature of the asset or liability 
we have categorized our assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level hierarchy in accordance with this guidance 
see note for a further discussion regarding our measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value 
valuation of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
we record property and equipment at cost  and record other intangible assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
we calculate amortization on other intangible assets using either the accelerated or the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  based on the nature of when we expect to receive cash inflows generated by the intangible assets 
impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
when indicators of impairment exist  we perform a review of the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including certain identifiable intangible assets 
no impairment losses were recorded on long lived assets during the years ended december   or valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we begin the process by assessing qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
after performing the aforementioned assessment and upon review of the results of such assessment  we may begin performing step one of the two step impairment analysis by quantitatively comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded on goodwill during the years ended december   or restructuring restructuring costs are included in loss from operations within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
losses on property and equipment are recorded consistent with our accounting policy related to long lived assets 
one time termination benefits are recorded at the time they are communicated to the affected employees 
losses on property lease obligations are recorded when the lease is abandoned 
in response to our ongoing review of current market conditions and internal operations we implemented restructuring activities during the year ended december  the restructuring was complete as of the end of fiscal year on february   we announced a plan to restructure our diagnostic imaging business 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock units rsus to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
we estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is based on the stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest are recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical data for forfeitures and we are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 

table of contents warranty we generally provide a month warranty on our gamma cameras 
we accrue the estimated cost of this warranty at the time revenue is recorded and charge warranty expense to diagnostic imaging cost of revenues 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems covered by warranty 
warranty reserves are depleted as gamma cameras are repaired 
the costs consist principally of materials  personnel  overhead and transportation 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized 
in making such a determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we follow the provisions of accounting standards codification income taxes  that defines a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the topic also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under the topic  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision

consolidated revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period  primarily as a result of a reduction in revenue generated from our dis business segment and lower camera revenue generated from product sales in our diagnostic imaging business segment 
dis revenue accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for prior year period 
we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period 
the decrease resulted from a reduction in the number of days our physician customers utilized our imaging services and a decline in our daily service fee 
diagnostic imaging 
our diagnostic imaging revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period  primarily due to the mix of camera products which were sold to cardiology practices and hospitals 
the number of cameras sold increased to from during the year ended december  and  respectively 
it is likely that the long term volume and total revenue of our diagnostic imaging camera sales will decrease in the future due to the diagnostic imaging restructuring initiative 
cost of revenue and gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in consolidated gross profit is primarily the result of the mix in camera product sales from our diagnostic imaging business segment  increased excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of the diagnostic imaging restructuring initiative and fewer imaging days in our dis business segment  partially offset by lower radiopharmaceutical costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year 
table of contents ended december  from for the prior year 
dis 
cost of dis revenue consists of labor  radiopharmaceuticals  equipment depreciation  and other costs associated with the provision of services

operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses are the costs associated with the design  development and expansion of our existing technology and consist of salaries  development material costs  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees  and non recurring engineering costs 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or compared to the prior year mainly due to initiatives to explore and develop new products and technologies 
research and development expenses were and of diagnostic imaging revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to a decrease in diagnostic imaging revenue of million and the aforementioned exploration of new initiatives 
we expect research and development costs to decrease in the future as a result of the diagnostic imaging restructuring initiative 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  recruiting costs  travel  marketing and collateral materials and trade show costs 
marketing and sales expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of lower personnel related costs and marketing support costs 
marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of total revenues were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period  primarily as a result of a reduction in our dis business segment combined with lower camera sales in our diagnostic imaging business segment 
dis revenue accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for prior year period 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period 
the decrease resulted from a reduction in our daily lease fee combined with a reduction in the number of days we were able to scan for our physician customers 
we reduced our daily lease fee in to provide more incentive to our physician customers to continue using our services  since cms reduced reimbursement to the physicians for our diagnostic imaging procedures significantly at the beginning of we were only able to increase our daily lease fee slightly in furthermore  our physician customers reduced the number of days they scanned in  in part due to the lack of patient volume as a result of the poor economy  in part due to the uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace  and in part due to other factors such as physician pre certification requirements 
the worldwide shortage of radiopharmaceuticals  which significantly impacted our business in  was not a factor in as full medical isotope supply was restored 
diagnostic imaging 
our diagnostic imaging revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period primarily due to a reduction in the number of cameras which were 
table of contents sold to cardiology practices and hospitals 
the number of cameras sold decreased to from during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that economic factors affected our customers buying decisions  including the uncertainty in the credit markets  a slowing economy  and continued healthcare imaging reimbursement pressures 
cost of revenue and gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the increase in consolidated gross profit is primarily the result of improving gross margins in our diagnostic imaging and dis business segments 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period 
dis 
cost of dis revenue consists of labor  radiopharmaceuticals  equipment depreciation  and other costs associated with the provision of services 
cost of dis revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period  primarily as a result of decreased expenses from fewer scans  more efficient utilization of labor and equipment  aligning labor and revenue by a shift from all full time fixed labor to some part time variable labor  combining certain positions and changing the useful lives of our dis camera fleet from five years to ten years 
this change in lives resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense  included in cost of revenues  of approximately million in the year ended december  dis gross profit was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or as compared to the prior year period 
dis gross profit as a percentage of dis revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due to improvement in operational performance primarily associated with the management of labor and equipment and the change in the useful lives of our dis camera fleet 
diagnostic imaging

cost of diagnostic imaging revenues was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  over the prior year period 
diagnostic imaging gross profit was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or as compared to the prior year period 
diagnostic imaging gross profit as a percentage of diagnostic imaging revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year due to lower excess and obsolete inventory reserves and the sale of certain previously reserved cameras  partially offset by higher manufacturing variances due to a key component supply issue 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses are associated with the design  development and enhancement of our products  and consist of salaries  development material costs  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees  and non recurring engineering costs 
we continue to invest in research and development with a focus on innovation as we seek to improve our existing technology

research and development expenses were and of diagnostic imaging revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  recruiting costs  travel  marketing and collateral materials and trade show costs and market study 
marketing and sales expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the increase in marketing spend was primarily a result of our decision to invest in a strategic marketing study with a premier healthcare consulting firm 
without that investment  marketing and sales expenses would have remained relatively flat for the years ended december  and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for accounting  human resources  information technology and executive personnel  legal related costs  professional fees  outside services  insurance  and costs related to our board of directors 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of lower bad debt reserves and lower legal and consulting services compared to the prior year  as well as our continued efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiencies 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of other expenses 
the decrease in other income of million is attributable to a decrease in interest rates and a slight decrease in our average cash balance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures and to finance accounts receivable and inventory  which we manage closely 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of nuclear cameras  ultrasound machines  vans  manufacturing and development equipment and computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million 
we generally invest our cash reserves in money market funds  us treasury and corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe our working capital  together with cash flows from operating activities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next months 
cash flows the following table shows cash flow information for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities net cash used in operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the increase was primarily related to the increase in net loss and decreases in non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily attributable to the decreased net loss  increases related to changes in working capital accounts particularly collection of accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in inventory and decreased non cash charges related to depreciation  bad debt and other non cash charges 
investing activities net cash used in investment activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
on december   we acquired the operating assets of a nuclear and ultrasound imaging business located in the southeastern us the total cash used for this acquisition was  the remaining increased use of cash compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased net investments in securities available for sale 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased net proceeds from maturing available for sale securities partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily attributable to repurchases of common stock 
net cash provided financing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased stock option exercises 
contractual obligations we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the value of debt securities in our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
changes in interest rates over time will increase or decrease our interest income
