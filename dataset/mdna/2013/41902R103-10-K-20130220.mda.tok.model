item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for further discussion regarding risks related to exposure to european financial institution counterparties in light of recent market conditions 
we would also lose money on a repurchase transaction if the value of the underlying securities has declined as of the end of the transaction term  as we would have to repurchase the securities for their initial value but would receive securities worth less than that amount 
any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could adversely affect our earnings  and thus our cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction  the counterparty can terminate the transaction and cease entering into any other repurchase transactions with us 
in that case  we would likely need to establish a replacement repurchase facility with another repurchase dealer in order to continue to leverage our portfolio and carry out our investment strategy 
there is no assurance we would be able to establish a suitable replacement facility on acceptable terms or at all 
our use of repurchase agreements to borrow funds may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender file for bankruptcy 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code  giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and to take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay in the event that we file for bankruptcy 
furthermore  the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that a lender files for bankruptcy 
thus  our use of repurchase agreements will expose our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or us 
risks related to our corporate structure failure to maintain an exemption from the investment company act would adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that we conduct our business in a manner that allows us to avoid being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
under section c c  the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
the staff of the sec has provided 
table of contents guidance on the availability of this exemption 
specifically  the staff s position generally requires us to maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying real estate interests and in real estate related investments including our qualifying real estate interests 
we refer to this exemption as the mortgage exemption 
in order to constitute a qualifying real estate interest under the requirement  a real estate interest must meet various criteria 
mortgage securities that do not represent all of the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not qualify for purposes of the requirement 
our ownership of these mortgage securities  therefore  is limited by the provisions of the investment company act 
accordingly  we intend to maintain at least of our assets in whole pools of mortgages issued by ginnie mae  fannie mae or freddie mac 
however  competition for investments may prevent us from acquiring mortgage securities that meet the requirement at favorable yields or from acquiring sufficient qualifying securities to comply with the mortgage exemption under the investment company act 
in addition  on august   the sec issued a concept release no 
ic  file no 
sw  companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mbs and rely on the exemption from registration under section c c of the investment company act such as us should continue to be allowed to rely on such exemption from registration 
if we fail to continue to qualify for this exemption from registration as an investment company  or the sec determines that companies that invest in mbs are no longer able to rely on this exemption  our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as planned  or we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  either of which could negatively affect the value of shares of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
we are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting  internal audit and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared 
we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  including the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
section requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments as of december  these reporting and other obligations  such as our status as a large accelerated filer  place significant demands on our management  administrative  operational  internal audit and accounting resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems  implement additional financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  expand or outsource our internal audit function  and hire additional accounting  internal audit and finance staff 
if we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion  our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired 
any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 

table of contents our policies are determined by our board of directors  and our shareholders have limited rights 
our board of directors is responsible for our strategic business direction 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to acquisitions  leasing  financing  growth  operations  debt limitation and distributions  are determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our shareholders 
our board s broad discretion in setting policies and shareholders inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks you face as a shareholder 
our board of directors may approve the issuance of capital stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us and may increase or decrease our authorized capital stock without shareholder approval 
subject to the rights of holders of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock to approve the classification or issuance of any class or series of stock ranking senior to our series a preferred stock  our charter permits our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock  issuable in one or more classes or series 
we may issue a class of preferred stock to individual investors in order to comply with the various reit requirements 
our charter further permits our board of directors to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our authorized stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series without shareholder approval 
subject to the rights of holders of series a preferred stock discussed above  our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued shares of preferred or common stock and establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote  participate in earnings and to convert into shares of our common stock of any such shares of stock  which rights may be superior to those of shares of our common stock 
thus  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred or common stock with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common stock 
furthermore  to the extent we issue additional equity interests  your percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted 
in addition  depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offerings  you may also experience dilution in the book value and fair value of your shares 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the code  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or under applicable attribution rules  by five or fewer individuals as defined by the code to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year other than our first reit taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our charter generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person of either more than the aggregate stock ownership limit or more than the common stock ownership limit 
in addition  the articles supplementary for our series a preferred stock provide that generally no person may own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  either more than in value or in number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding series a preferred stock 
generally  shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limits 
any transfer of shares of our stock that would violate the ownership limits will result in the shares that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limits being designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership 
the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
the beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limits could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of shares of common stock might receive a premium for their shares of common stock over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
the ownership limit provisions also may make our shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of either more than of the number or value of our outstanding shares of common stock or series a preferred stock or more than of the number or value of our outstanding shares of all classes 

table of contents provisions of maryland law and other provisions of our organizational documents may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law mgcl may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests  including business combination provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested stockholder  and thereafter impose special shareholder voting requirements on these combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the acquiring shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares 
our bylaws provide that we are not subject to the control share provisions of the mgcl 
however  our board of directors may elect to make the control share statute applicable to us at any time  and may do so without shareholder approval 
title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of directors  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws  to elect on behalf of our company to be subject to statutory provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest 
pursuant to title  subtitle of the mgcl  our charter provides that our board of directors will have the exclusive power to fill vacancies on our board 
as a result  unless all of the directorships are vacant  our shareholders will not be able to fill vacancies with nominees of their own choosing 
our board of directors may elect to opt in to additional provisions of title  subtitle of the mgcl without shareholder approval at any time 
additionally  our charter and bylaws contain other provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
for example  our charter and bylaws provide that the number of directors constituting our full board may be fixed only by our directors  that our bylaws may only be amended by our directors and that a special meeting of shareholders may not be called by holders of our common stock holding less than a majority of our outstanding shares entitled to vote at such meeting 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited  which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in shareholders best interests 
our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
our charter also authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law  and our bylaws obligate us  to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law  to indemnify any present or former director or officer of our company from and against any claim or liability to which he or she may become subject by reason of his or her service in that capacity 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 
finally  we have entered into agreements with our directors and officers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify them to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 

table of contents future offerings of debt securities  which would rank senior to our common stock upon liquidation  and future offerings of equity securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our common stock is ranked junior to our series a preferred stock 
our outstanding series a preferred stock also has or will have a preference upon our dissolution  liquidation or winding up in respect of assets available for distribution to our shareholders 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional offerings of equity securities  including commercial paper  senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred stock or common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock  if any  and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
preferred stock could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
we intend to pay quarterly dividends and to make distributions to our shareholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year  subject to certain adjustments  is distributed 
this  along with other factors  should enable us to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a reit under the code 
however  we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this report 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  some of our distributions may include a return of capital 
broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our stock 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in our operations or earnings estimates or publication of research reports about us or the industry  increases in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  
table of contents additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  speculation in the press or investment community  and general market and economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and may have been unrelated to operating performances of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock 
future issuances or sales of shares could cause our share price to decline 
sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through a sale of additional equity securities 
other issuances of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
federal income tax risks if we do not qualify as a reit  we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and face substantial tax liability 
we expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code 
however  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations exist 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  new tax legislation  administrative guidance or court decisions  in each instance potentially with retroactive effect  could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any tax year  then we would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation  which  among other things  means being unable to deduct distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income and being subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders  which could in turn have an adverse impact on the value of our stock 
furthermore  unless we were entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification  and thus  our cash available for distribution to shareholders would be reduced for each of the years during which we did not qualify as a reit 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 

table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations 
under these provisions  any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate  inflation and or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit and gross income tests if the instrument hedges interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate assets or risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the reit or gross income tests  and such instrument is properly identified under applicable regulations of the us treasury 
income from hedging transactions entered into prior to july  that hedge interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate assets will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit gross income test  but will not be qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income test 
income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the reit and gross income tests 
as a result of these rules  we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous  which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur 
the failure of agency securities subject to a repurchase agreement to qualify as real estate assets would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
we have entered and intend to continue to enter into repurchase agreements under which we will nominally sell certain of our agency securities to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets 
we believe that for us federal income tax purposes these transactions will be treated as secured debt and we will be treated as the owner of the agency securities that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that such agreement may transfer record ownership of such assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement 
it is possible  however  that the internal revenue service could successfully assert that we do not own the agency securities during the term of the repurchase agreement  in which case we could fail to qualify as a reit 
complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash items  government securities and qualified reit real estate assets 
the remainder of our investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of our assets other than government securities and qualified real estate assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct such failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our reit status and suffering adverse tax consequences 
as a result  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
complying with reit requirements may force us to borrow to make distributions to shareholders or otherwise depend on external sources of capital to fund such distributions 
as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income subject to certain adjustments to our shareholders 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
while we generally intend to make distributions so that no income or excise taxes are due  we may from time to time  consistent with maintaining our reit qualification  elect to pay taxes in lieu of making current distributions if we decide that strategy is more favorable to our shareholders 

table of contents from time to time  we may generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes due to  among other things  amortization of capitalized purchase premiums  or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to shareholders 
if we do not have other funds available in these situations  we could be required to borrow funds  sell a portion of our agency securities at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds in order to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax in a particular year 
these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity 
because of the distribution requirement  it is unlikely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital needs in connection with investments  from cash retained from operations 
as a result  to fund future capital needs  we likely will have to rely on third party sources of capital  including both debt and equity financing  which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an externally managed mortgage reit incorporated in maryland in september to invest in single family residential mortgage pass through securities guaranteed or issued by a us government agency such as ginnie mae  or by a us government sponsored entity such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
our principal goal is to generate net income for distribution to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and protect and grow our shareholders equity which we also refer to as our book value through prudent interest rate risk management 
our net income is determined primarily by the difference between the interest income we earn on our agency securities net of premium or discount amortization and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities  which we also refer to as our net interest spread or net interest margin 
we utilize substantial borrowings in financing our investment portfolio  which can enhance potential returns but exacerbate losses 
in general  our book value is most affected by our issuance of shares of our common stock  our retained earnings or losses  and changes in the value of our investment portfolio and our hedging instruments 
in order to grow our company  we may from time to time raise additional capital using various market based transactions 
accordingly  all of our financial results and data should be viewed with the knowledge that our equity raises have been significant for our company  and that some period to period comparisons may not be meaningful or may produce comparisons that may be misleading to future activity and results 
the following table represents key data regarding our company since the quarter ending march  
table of contents in thousands except per share amounts quarterly weighted repurchase shares book value average earnings as of agency securities agreements equity outstanding per share per share december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  includes unsettled purchases and forward commitments to purchase agency securities 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
we invest in financial assets and markets  and recent events  including those discussed below  can affect our business in ways that are difficult to predict  and produce results outside of typical operating variances 
our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  government actions  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment rates on our agency securities purchased at a premium increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such asset coupon rates will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities used to finance those assets 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
with the maturities of our assets generally being longer term than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our assets and therefore our book value 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
prepayments on agency securities and the underlying mortgage loans may be influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control  and consequently such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
to the extent we have acquired agency securities at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our agency securities will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of these prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income may suffer 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage market significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we intend to use hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not intend to hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our portfolio 
in addition  a variety of other factors relating to our business may also impact our financial condition and operating performance 
these factors include 
table of contents our degree of leverage  our access to funding and borrowing capacity  our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  the market value of our agency securities  and the reit requirements  the requirements to qualify for an exemption under the investment company act and other regulatory and accounting policies related to our business 
our manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our equity as defined in our management agreement  regardless of the performance of our portfolio 
accordingly  the payment of our management fee may not decline in the event of a decline in our profitability and may cause us to incur losses 
for a discussion of additional risks relating to our business see item a risk factors 
market and interest rate trends and the effect on our portfolio credit market disruption since  the residential housing and mortgage markets in the united states have experienced a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions including historically high loan defaults and credit losses  as well as decreased liquidity 
recently  the financial weakness of some of the european union sovereign nations has renewed concerns of the stability of financial systems worldwide 
further increased volatility and deterioration in the overall financial markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the agency securities in which we invest 
in addition  we rely on the availability of financing to acquire agency securities on a leveraged basis 
if market conditions deteriorate further  our lenders may exit the repurchase market  further tighten lending standards  or increase the amount of equity capital or haircut required to obtain financing  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
developments at fannie mae and freddie mac payments on the agency securities in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
because of the guarantee and the underwriting standards associated with mortgages underlying agency securities  agency securities historically have had high stability in value and have been considered to present low credit risk 
in  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed under the conservatorship of the us government due to the significant weakness of their financial condition 
the turmoil in the residential mortgage sector and concern over the future role of fannie mae and freddie mac at the time generally increased credit spreads and decreased price stability of agency securities 
in response to the credit market disruption and the deteriorating financial condition of fannie mae and freddie mac  congress and the us treasury undertook a series of actions in aimed at stabilizing the financial markets in general  and the mortgage market in particular 
these actions include the large scale buying of mbs  significant equity infusions into banks and aggressive monetary policy 
in february  the us treasury along with the us department of housing and urban development released a report entitled reforming america s housing finance market to congress outlining alternatives for reforming the us housing system  specifically fannie mae and freddie mac  and transforming the government s involvement in the housing market 
other industry groups  such as the mortgage bankers association and the national association home builders  have also issued proposals outlining their views of the path for housing reform 
it is unclear how future legislation may impact the 
table of contents housing finance market and the investing environment for agency securities  as the method of reform is undecided and has not yet been defined by the regulators 
without government support for residential mortgages  we may not be able to execute our current business model in an efficient manner 
on october   the federal housing finance authority the fhfa released its white paper entitled building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market the fhfa white paper 
this release follows up on the fhfa s february  strategic plan for enterprise conservatorships  which set forth three goals for the next phase of the fannie mae and freddie mac conservatorships 
these three goals are to i build a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market  ii gradually contract fannie mae and freddie mac s presence in the marketplace while simplifying and shrinking their operations  and iii maintain foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability for new and refinanced mortgages 
the fhfa white paper proposes a new infrastructure for fannie mae and freddie mac that has two basic goals 
the first goal is to replace the current  outdated infrastructures of fannie mae and freddie mac with a common  more efficient infrastructure that aligns the standards and practices of the two entities  beginning with core functions performed by both entities such as issuance  master servicing  bond administration  collateral management and data integration 
the second goal is to establish an operating framework for fannie mae and freddie mac that is consistent with the progress of housing finance reform and encourages and accommodates the increased participation of private capital in assuming credit risk associated with the secondary mortgage market 
the fhfa recognizes that there are a number of impediments to their goals which may or may not be surmountable  such as the absence of any significant secondary mortgage market mechanisms beyond fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  and that their proposals are in the formative stages 
as a result  it is unclear if the proposals will be enacted 
if such proposals are enacted  it is unclear how closely what is enacted will resemble the proposals from the fhfa white paper or what the effects of the enactment will be 
us treasury and agency securities market intervention one of the main factors impacting market prices has been the us federal reserve s programs to purchase us treasury and agency securities in the open market 
on september   the us federal reserve announced operation twist  which is a program by which it purchased  by the end of december  more than billion of us treasury securities with remaining maturities between six and years and sold an equal amount of us treasury securities with remaining maturities of three years or less 
in december  in an effort to keep long term interest rates at low levels  the us federal reserve announced an expansion of its asset buying program starting in january  at which time it would commence outright purchases of longer term us treasury securities at a pace of billion per month 
this new us treasury securities purchase program replaces operation twist  which expired in december on january   the us federal reserve affirmed its intention to continue this policy 
by reducing the available supply of longer term us treasury securities in the market  these actions should put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term us treasury securities  like certain types of agency securities 
the reduction in longer term interest rates  in turn  may contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that the us federal reserve hopes will provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery 
in september  the us federal reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing aimed to improve the employment outlook and increase growth in the us economy 
to accomplish this goal  it announced that it would purchase at least billion of agency securities per month on an open ended timeline  in addition to the reinvestment of the proceeds of principal repayments from its existing mbs holdings 
additionally  it pledged to keep short term interest rates near zero for an extended period of time  currently estimated by the us federal reserve to be at least mid these programs have had many effects on our assets 
one effect of these purchases has been an increase in the prices of agency securities  which has contributed to the decrease of our net interest margin 
the unpredictability of these programs has also injected additional volatility into the pricing and 
table of contents availability of our assets 
it is difficult to quantify the impact  as there are many factors at work at the same time which affects the price of our securities and  therefore  our yield and book value 
due to the unpredictability in the markets for our securities in particular and yield generating assets in general  there is no pattern that can be implied with any certainty 
we believe the largest risk is that if the government decides to sell significant portions of its portfolio  then we may see meaningful price declines 
us government credit rating the us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns in mid led to the downgrade by standard poor s of the us government s credit rating for the first time in history 
assets backed by fannie mae and freddie mac are considered to have the credit of the us government  and thus were also downgraded at that time 
while the other rating agencies have not downgraded the us government s rating  if they were to do so it would likely impact the perceived credit risk associated with agency securities and  therefore  decrease the value of the agency securities in our portfolio 
in addition  further downgrades of the us government s credit rating or the credit ratings of certain european countries would likely create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which could have a serious negative impact on the global banking system 
this could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory concerns we believe that we conduct our business in a manner that allows us to avoid being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act pursuant to the exemption provided by section c c for entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate 
on august   the sec issued a concept release no 
ic  file no 
sw  companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments pursuant to which it is reviewing whether certain companies that invest in mbs and rely on the exemption from registration under section c c of the investment company act such as us should continue to be allowed to rely on such exemption from registration 
if we fail to continue to qualify for this exemption from registration as an investment company  or the sec determines that companies that invest in mbs are no longer able to rely on this exemption  our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as planned  or we may be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act  either of which could negatively affect the value of shares of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
certain programs initiated by the us government  through the federal housing administration and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures are currently in effect 
the programs may involve  among other things  the modification of mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans or the rate of interest payable on the loans  or to extend the payment terms of the loans 
while the effect of these programs has not been as extensive as originally expected  the effect of such programs for holders of agency securities could be that such holders would experience changes in the anticipated yields of their agency securities due to i increased prepayment rates and ii lower interest and principal payments 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act into law 
the dodd frank act is extensive  complicated and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of banking  and a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry 
although many provisions remain subject to further rulemaking  the dodd frank act implements numerous and far reaching changes that affect financial companies  including our company  and other banks and institutions which are important to our business model 
certain notable rules are  among other things requiring regulation and oversight of large  systemically important financial institutions by establishing an interagency council on systemic risk and implementation of heightened prudential standards and regulation by the board of governors of the us federal reserve for systemically important financial institutions including nonbank financial companies  as well as the implementation of the fdic resolution procedures for liquidation of large financial companies to avoid market disruption  
table of contents applying the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies  savings and loan holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies  limiting the us federal reserve s emergency authority to lend to nondepository institutions to facilities with broad based eligibility  and authorizing the fdic to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding companies  subject to the approval of congress  the secretary of the us treasury and the us federal reserve  creating regimes for regulation of over the counter derivatives and non admitted property and casualty insurers and reinsurers  implementing regulation of hedge fund and private equity advisers by requiring such advisers to register with the sec  providing for the implementation of corporate governance provisions for all public companies concerning proxy access and executive compensation  and reforming regulation of credit rating agencies 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  including certain provisions described above are subject to further study  rulemaking  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
as the hundreds of regulations called for by the dodd frank act are promulgated  we will continue to evaluate the impact of any such regulations 
it is unclear how this legislation may impact the borrowing environment  investing environment for agency securities and interest rate swaps as much of the bill s implementation has not yet been defined by the regulators 
in addition  in  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
beginning with the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements  basel iii will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the final package of basel iii reforms were approved by the g leaders in november and are subject to individual adoption by member nations  including the united states by january  it is unclear how the adoption of basel iii will affect our business at this time 
in september  the administration announced it was working on a major plan to allow certain homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to refinance 
in october  the fhfa announced changes to harp to expand access to refinancing for qualified individuals and families whose homes have lost value  including increasing the harp loan to value ratio above 
however  this would only apply to mortgages guaranteed by the us government sponsored entities 
in addition  the expansion does not change the time period which these loans were originated  maintaining the requirement that the loans must have been guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac prior to june there are many challenging issues to this proposal  notably the question as to whether a loan with a loan to value ratio of qualifies as a mortgage or an unsecured consumer loan 
the chances of this initiative s success have created additional uncertainty in the agency securities market  particularly with respect to possible increases in prepayment rates 
we do not expect this announcement to have a significant impact on our results of operations 

table of contents on january   the us federal reserve released a report titled the us housing market current conditions and policy considerations to congress providing a framework for thinking about certain issues and tradeoffs that policy makers might consider 
it is unclear how future legislation may impact the housing finance market and the investing environment for agency securities as the method of reform is undecided and has not yet been defined by the regulators 
exposure to european financial counterparties we have no direct exposure to any european sovereign credit 
we do finance the acquisition of our agency securities with repurchase agreements  some of which are provided by european banks 
in connection with these financing arrangements  we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing 
the amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over collateralization ranging from of the amount borrowed 
while repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheet  we are exposed to the counterparty  if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing  a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets 
the amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure in connection with our repurchase agreement financings 
we will make cash payments or pledge securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement in connection with interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position 
in the event that a counterparty were to default on its obligation  we would be exposed to a loss to a swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of cash or securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral 
during the past several years  several large european banks have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large european banks 
some of these banks have us banking subsidiaries  which have provided financing to us  particularly repurchase agreement financing for the acquisition of agency securities 
at december   we had entered into repurchase agreements and or interest rate swaps with seven financial institution counterparties that are either domiciled in europe or a us based subsidiary of a european domiciled financial institution 
our total exposure to these banks was of our equity at december  at december   we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge these exposures  although we may in the future 
the following table shows our exposure by country to european banks 
dollars in thousands number of counterparties exposure exposure as a percentage of equity england france germany netherlands scotland switzerland exposure represents our total assets pledged as collateral in excess of our obligations  including any accrued interest receivable on the pledged assets 
if the european credit crisis continues to impact these major european banks  there is the possibility that it will also impact the operations of their us banking subsidiaries 
this could adversely affect our financing and operations as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general 
management monitors our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis  using various methods  including review of recent rating agency actions or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and or the fair of swaps with our counterparties 
we intend to make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements  or take other necessary actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when such actions are considered necessary 

table of contents interest rates mortgage markets in general  and our strategy in particular  are interest rate sensitive 
the relationship between several interest rates is generally determinant of the performance of our company 
our borrowings in the repurchase market have historically closely tracked libor and the us federal funds target rate 
significant volatility in these rates or a divergence from the historical relationship among these rates could negatively impact our ability to manage our portfolio 
the agency securities we buy are affected by the shape of the yield curve  particularly along the area between two year treasury rate and year treasury rates 
the following table shows the day libor as compared to these rates at each period end day libor fed funds two year treasury year treasury december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  principal repayment rate our net income is primarily a function of the difference between the yield on our assets and the financing cost of owning those assets 
since we tend to purchase assets at a premium to par  the main item that can affect the yield on our assets after they are purchased is the rate at which the mortgage borrowers repay the loan 
while the scheduled repayments  which are the principal portion of the homeowners regular monthly payments  are fairly predictable  the unscheduled repayments  which are generally refinancing of the mortgage  are less so 
estimates of repayment rates are critical to the management of our portfolio  not only for estimating current yield but also to consider the rate of reinvestment of those proceeds into new securities  the yields which those new securities may add to our portfolio  as well as the extent to which we extend the duration of our liabilities in connection with hedging activities

while our operations are affected in many ways by the issuance of additional shares  the most significant immediate earnings impact is that we generally do not invest all of the proceeds immediately 
depending on market conditions  and the fact that normal trade settlement on agency securities is not based on the trade date  we have averaged around two months to invest the proceeds from these offerings 
since each capital raise was individually significant to the size of our portfolio  our results from operations  and some statistics regarding such results  may not be meaningful or portray the underlying fundamentals of our investment portfolio

table of contents forward purchases while most of our purchases of agency securities are accounted for using trade date accounting  some forward purchases  such as certain tbas do not qualify for trade date accounting and are considered derivatives for financial statement purposes 
pursuant to asc topic  we account for these derivatives as all in one cash flow hedges 
the net fair value of the forward commitment is reported on the balance sheet as an asset or liability  with a corresponding unrealized gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income

liabilities we have entered into repurchase agreements to finance most of our agency securities 
our repurchase agreements are secured by our agency securities and bear interest at rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
as of december   we had established borrowing relationships  respectively with various investment banking firms and other lenders 
we had outstanding balances under our repurchase agreements at december  of billion 
hedging instruments we generally intend to hedge as much of our interest rate risk as our manager deems prudent in light of market conditions 
no assurance can be given that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that our manager is required to hedge 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  fair value accounting rules could foster adverse valuation adjustments due to credit quality considerations that could impact both earnings and shareholder equity  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our shareholders equity 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with counterparties to hedge a benchmark interest rate libor 
this portfolio of hedges is designed to lock in funding costs for specific funding activities associated with specific assets as a way to realize attractive net interest margins 
this hedging strategy incorporates an assumed prepayment schedule  which  if not realized  will cause our results to differ from expectations 
these swap agreements provide for fixed interest rates indexed off of one month libor and effectively fix the floating interest rates on billion of borrowings under our repurchase agreements 
if the rates on our repurchase agreements do not move in tandem with libor  we will be less effective at fixing this cost and our results will differ from expectations 

table of contents results of operations compared to our net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  or per weighted average share  a decrease of per share from earnings for the year ended december  of million or per weighted average share 
in general  the increase in the gross net income number was a result having a larger investment portfolio 
we increased our equity significantly by issuing additional common stock in march and issuing preferred stock in august in general this discussion will not comment on the increase in gross numbers as this was primarily a function of our increase in equity 
to understand the decrease on a per share basis requires a deeper look into the components of our business model 
two of the main drivers of earnings in an interest rate sensitive business are the interest rate cycle and the steepness of the yield curve 
generally  as the falling interest rate part of the cycle comes to an end  the difference between the amount we earn on our assets and pay on our liabilities  or net interest spread  experiences compression 
while there is a wide range of reasons and timing aspects  this trend is reflective of the yield curve in general 
often at the same time  this compression is exacerbated by an increased rate of homeowner refinancing  or prepayments  which occurs as mortgage rates fall 
prepayment rates trended higher during due to interest rates remaining at historic lows  the flattening of the yield curve  and continued actions by the us federal reserve and us treasury to make refinancing a mortgage economically attractive 
in our portfolio  higher prepayments contributed in three ways to lower interest income higher premium amortization expense and lower asset yields  lower average earning assets  and lower weighted average coupon as new investments were at lower coupons 
while the relative difference between our interest income and interest expense is more important to our net income than the absolute level of rates  the yield on our assets is significantly affected by the coupon rate 
because of lower overall mortgage rates  our weighted average coupon at december  was  a decrease from december   when our assets had a weighted average coupon of 
these coupon rates declined throughout primarily due to continued economic weakness  further declines in the us housing market  and continued pressure on mortgage rates from us government policy 
this resulted in our asset purchases being on average at lower interest rates 
spread compression is a normal part of an interest rate cycle  the affects of which become more pronounced the longer that rates stay low and stable 
our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase compared to the year ended december  amount of million 
in  our portfolio had an average yield of and a cost of funds including hedges of 
this resulted in a net interest margin or spread of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our portfolio had a yield of and a cost of funds of  generating a net interest rate spread of 
after coupon rate  the yield on our assets is most directly affected by the rate of repayments on our agency securities 
the percentage rate of our portfolio repayment for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  while this rate of repayment was higher than in  it was in line with our expectations based on current market conditions 
at december   our portfolio had an average dollar price of per of face value 
keeping the price of our portfolio close to par helps us predict and manage the costs associated with the repayment speeds of our assets  as changes in repayments speeds have a lesser affect on income than a portfolio with a higher premium price 
our weighted average cost of funds not including hedges for the year ended december  was  increasing from for the year ended december  while our repurchase agreement rates are often similar to  and move in connection with  the corresponding libor  that was not the case for libor stayed consistently low throughout  ending at while our repurchase agreement rates rose 
in  we incurred expense related to our interest rate hedges of million  as 
table of contents compared to million for the year ended december  we increased our total notional interest rate swap amount from billion at december  to billion at december  the additional capital raises during the year allowed us to increase the notional amount of our interest rate swaps  lower our average swap interest rate while maintaining the percentage of assets hedge in a similar range with prior year 
the overall rate on our hedges resulted in an average cost of funds for the year ended december  of  down from for the year ended december  we ended with a total billion of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average rate of and weighted average remaining term of months 
we sold some of our agency securities in as part of normal adjustments to our portfolio 
although we typically buy and hold our securities  as conditions change in any year we may choose to dispose of certain securities 
for example  we may dispose of a security if it falls outside of our current desired asset mix or we believe it to be at an increased risk of prepayment 
we may also sell securities as part of a broader strategy move to be more defensive in managing the portfolio as market conditions change 
in  we disposed of billion face value of agency securities for a net gain of million 
in  we disposed of billion face value of agency securities for a net gain of million

total operating expenses were million which represented basis points on average daily equity for the year ended december  the year ended december  total expenses were million which represented basis points on average equity for the year 
the main component of our operating expense is our management fee  which is paid according to the management agreement and is based on total equity excluding unrealized gains and losses 
this comprised million of the total expenses 
the remaining expenses are share based compensation of million  which represents the amortization of stock awards to certain officers and directors  and general and administrative expenses of million  which includes liability insurance  auditing fees  exchange fees  and other administrative costs 
compared to our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per weighted average share  a decrease of per share from earnings for the year ended december  of million or per weighted average share 
in general  the increase in the gross net income number was a result of our significant capital raises early in in general this discussion will not comment on the increase in gross numbers as this was primarily a function of our increase in equity 
prepayment rates trended higher during due to falling interest rates  a flatter yield curve  and continued actions by the us federal reserve and us treasury to make refinancing a mortgage economically attractive 
in our portfolio  higher prepayments contributed in three ways to lower interest income higher premium amortization expense and lower asset yields  lower average earning assets  and lower weighted average coupon as new investments were at lower coupons 
while the relative difference between our interest income and interest expense is more important to our net income than the absolute level of rates  the yield on our assets is significantly affected by the coupon rate 
because of lower overall mortgage rates  our weighted average coupon at december  was  a decrease from december   when our assets had a weighted average coupon of 
these coupon rates declined throughout primarily due to continued economic weakness  further declines in the us housing market  and continued pressure on mortgage rates from us government policy 
this resulted in our asset purchases being on average at lower interest rates 
spread compression is a normal part of an interest rate cycle  the affects of which become more pronounced the longer that rates stay low and stable 

table of contents our net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase compared to the year ended december  amount of million 
in  our portfolio had an average yield of and a cost of funds including hedges of 
this resulted in a net interest margin or spread of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our portfolio had a yield of and a cost of funds of  generating a net interest rate spread of 
after coupon rate  the yield on our assets is most directly affected by the rate of repayments on our agency securities 
the percentage rate of our portfolio repayment for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  while this rate of repayment was lower in  it was still higher than expected  and in the us government instituted a one time repurchase of delinquent mortgages  which skewed the rate higher for that year 
at december   our portfolio had an average dollar price of per of face value 
keeping the price of our portfolio close to par helps us predict and manage the costs associated with the repayment speeds of our assets  as changes in repayments speeds have a lesser affect on income than a portfolio with a higher premium price 
our weighted average cost of funds not including hedges for the year ended december  was  decreasing from year ended december  the main indicator of our borrowing costs is the day libor  which generally closely parallels the rates we pay on our repurchase agreements 
the libor rate stayed consistently low throughout  ending at 
in  we incurred expense related to our interest rate hedges of million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we increased our total notional interest rate swap amount from billion at december  to billion at december  lower repurchase rates combined with a lower overall rate on our hedges resulted in an average cost of funds for the year ended december  of  down from for the year ended december  we ended with a total billion of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average rate of and weighted average term of months 
we sold some of our agency securities in as part of normal adjustments to our portfolio 
although we typically buy and hold our securities  as conditions change in any year we may choose to dispose of certain securities 
for example  we may dispose of a security if it falls outside of our current desired asset mix or we believe it to be at an increased risk of prepayment 
in  we disposed of billion face value of agency securities for a net gain of million 
in  we disposed of million face value of agency securities for a gain of million 
our total operating expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  when measured as a percentage of average equity  they decreased meaningfully 
total operating expenses were million which represented basis points on average daily equity for the year ended december  the year ended december  total expenses were million which represented basis points on average equity for the year 
the main component of our operating expense is our management fee  which is paid according to the management agreement and is based on total equity excluding unrealized gains and losses 
this comprised million of the total expenses 
the remaining expenses are share based compensation of million  which represents the amortization of stock awards to certain officers and directors  and general and administrative expenses of million  which includes liability insurance  auditing fees  exchange fees  and other administrative costs 
contractual obligations and commitments we had the following contractual obligations under repurchase agreements as of december  and december  dollar amounts in thousands 
table of contents december  dollars in thousands balance weighted average contractual rate contractual interest payments total contractual obligation within days days to months months to months december  dollars in thousands balance weighted average contractual rate contractual interest payments total contractual obligation within days days to months months to months from time to time we may make forward commitments to purchase our agency securities 
the commitments require physical settlement with the sellers on settlement date  usually between and days from the date of trade 
the following table shows the agency securities forward purchase commitments shown as a net liability on the balance sheet as of december  face cost fair market value due to brokers we had contractual commitments under interest rate swap agreements as of december  these agreements were for a total notional amount of billion  had an average rate of and a weighted average term of months 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are borrowings under repurchase arrangements and monthly principal and interest payments on our investments 
other sources of funds may include proceeds from debt and equity offerings and asset sales 
we generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long term investment capital 
because the level of these borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a reit 
in response to the growth of our agency securities portfolio and to recent turbulent market conditions  we have aggressively pursued additional lending counterparties in order to help increase our financial flexibility and ability to withstand periods of contracting liquidity in the credit markets 
at december   we had uncommitted repurchase facilities with lending counterparties to finance this portfolio  subject to certain conditions  and have borrowings outstanding with of these counterparties 
liquidity sources repurchase facilities with repurchase facilities being an integral part of our financing strategy  and thus our financial condition  full understanding of the repurchase market is necessary to understand the risks and drivers of 
table of contents our business 
for example  we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
and while we have borrowing capacity under our repurchase facilities well in excess of what is required for our operations  these borrowing lines are uncommitted and generally do not provide long term excess liquidity 
currently  we have not entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
the table below sets forth the average amount of repurchase agreements outstanding during each quarter and the amount of these repurchase agreements outstanding as of the end of each quarter for the last three years 
the amounts at a period end can be both above and below the average amounts for the quarter 
we do not manage our portfolio to have a pre designated amount of borrowings at quarter end 
these numbers will differ as we implement our portfolio management strategies and risk management strategies over changing market conditions 
in thousands average daily repurchase agreements repurchase agreements at period end highest daily repurchase balance during quarter lowest daily repurchase balance during quarter december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  as of december   the weighted average margin requirement  or the percentage amount by which the collateral value must exceed the loan amount  which we also refer to as the haircut  under all our repurchase agreements  was approximately weighted by borrowing amount 
as of december   our weighted average haircut was 
this rate remained constant as lending conditions have been stable 
we commonly receive margin calls from our lenders 
we may receive margin calls daily  although we typically receive them once or twice per month 
we receive margin calls under our repurchase agreements for two reasons 
one of these is what is known as a factor call which occurs each month when the new factors amount of principal remaining on the security are published by the issuing agency  such as fannie mae 
the second type of margin call we may receive is a valuation margin call 
both factor and valuation margin calls occur whenever the total value of our assets drops beyond a threshold amount  which is usually between  and  this threshold amount is generally set by each counterparty and does not vary based on the notional amount of the repurchase agreements outstanding with that counterparty 
both of these margin calls require a dollar for dollar restoration of the margin shortfall 
the total amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  plus any unpledged securities  is available to satisfy margin calls  if necessary 
as of december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively in agency securities  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents available to satisfy future margin calls 
to date  we have maintained sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls  and we have never been unable to satisfy a margin call  although no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy requests from our lenders to post additional collateral in the future 

table of contents one risk to our liquidity is the collateral  or haircut  held by our lenders 
in the event of insolvency by a repurchase agreement lender  our claim to our haircut becomes that of a general unsecured creditor 
in october of  mf global  inc  one of our lending counterparties  filed for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we were unable to recover approximately million that was due us at that time under our repurchase agreement with mf global  inc due to the complexity of this estate  it will likely be several years before we receive any clarity as to any recovery  and therefore  we recorded a loss allowance for the total amount due at that time 
an event of default or termination event under the standard master repurchase agreement would give our counterparty the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due by us to the counterparty to be payable immediately 
our agreements for our repurchase facilities generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the securities industry and financial markets association sifma as to repayment  margin requirements and the segregation of all purchased securities covered by the repurchase agreement 
in addition  each lender may require that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement that are generally required by the lender 
some of the typical terms which are included in such supplements and which supplement and amend terms contained in the standard agreement include changes to the margin maintenance requirements  purchase price maintenance requirements  the addition of a requirement that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default provisions 
these provisions differ for each of our lenders 
as discussed above under market and interest rate trends and the effect on our portfolio  over the last few years the residential mortgage market in the united states has experienced difficult conditions including increased volatility of many financial assets  including agency securities and other high quality mbs assets  due to news of potential security liquidations  increased volatility and deterioration in the broader residential mortgage and mbs markets  and significant disruption in financing of mbs 
although these conditions have lessened of late  if they increase and persist  our lenders may be forced to exit the repurchase market  become insolvent or further tighten lending standards or increase the amount of haircut  any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing 
effects of margin requirements  leverage and credit spreads our agency securities have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and  as discussed above  the market value of our agency securities will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase 
when the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase loan decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut  our lenders may issue a margin call  which means that the lender will require us to pay the margin call in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call 
under our repurchase facilities  our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the agency securities we pledge to them 
most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market 
lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled paydowns are announced monthly 
similar to the valuation margin calls that we receive on our repurchase agreements  we also receive margin calls on our interest rate swaps when the value of a hedge position declines 
this typically occurs 
table of contents when prevailing market rates decrease  with the severity of the decrease also dependent on the term of the hedges involved 
the amount of any margin call will be dollar for dollar  with a minimum transfer amount of between  and  our posting of collateral with our hedge counterparties can be done in cash or securities  and is generally bilateral  which means that if the value of our interest rate hedges increases  our counterparty will post collateral with us 
we experience margin calls in the ordinary course of our business  and under certain conditions  such as during a period of declining market value for agency securities  we experience margin calls at least monthly and often more frequently 
in seeking to manage effectively the margin requirements established by our lenders  we maintain a position of cash and unpledged securities 
we refer to this position as our liquidity 
the level of liquidity we have available to meet margin calls is directly affected by our leverage levels  our haircuts and the price changes on our securities 
if interest rates increase as a result of a yield curve shift or for another reason or if credit spreads widen  the prices of our collateral and our unpledged assets that constitute our liquidity will decline  we will experience margin calls  and we will use our liquidity to meet the margin calls 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet any margin calls 
if our haircuts increase  our liquidity will proportionately decrease 
in addition  if we increase our borrowings  our liquidity will decrease by the amount of additional haircut on the increased level of indebtedness 
we intend to maintain a level of liquidity in relation to our assets that enables us to meet reasonably anticipated margin calls but that also allows us to be substantially invested in agency securities 
we may misjudge the appropriate amount of our liquidity by maintaining excessive liquidity  which would lower our investment returns  or by maintaining insufficient liquidity  which would force us to liquidate assets into unfavorable market conditions and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   the weighted average haircut under our repurchase facilities was approximately  and our leverage defined as our debt to shareholders equity ratio was approximately liquidity sources capital offerings in addition to our repurchase borrowings  we also rely on primary securities offerings as a source of both short term and long term liquidity 
during the year ended december   we received funds from sales of our common stock under an at the market offering program and from fully underwritten offerings we completed in march and august 
in order to assure the continued availability of liquidity from capital offerings  we amended our charter on march   raising the total authorized shares of common stock to  as authorized under maryland general corporate law section a 
in addition  we amended the charter again in august  raising the total authorized shares of preferred stock to  at the market offerings from time to time  we may sell shares of our common stock in at the market offerings 
sales of the shares of common stock  if any  may be made in private transactions  negotiated transactions or any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act of  as amended  including sales made directly on the nyse or to or through a market maker other than on an exchange 
on february   we entered into sales agreements the sales agreements with cantor fitzgerald co 
cantor and jmp securities llc jmp to establish a new at the market program the program 
under the terms of the sales agreements  we may offer and sell up to  shares of our common stock from time to time through cantor or jmp  each acting as agent and or principal 
the shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the program are registered with the sec on our registration statement on form s no 
 which became effective upon filing on february  
table of contents for the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock in at the market transactions at an average price of per share raising net proceeds after sales commissions and expenses of approximately million 
we paid million in sales commissions to cantor and jmp during the year ended december  for the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock in at the market transactions at an average price of per share raising net proceeds  after sales commissions and expenses  of approximately million 
we paid million in sales commissions to cantor during the year ended december  underwritten offerings on march   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock  including  shares pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option  at a price to us of per share  and received net proceeds of approximately million after the payment of underwriting discounts and expenses

on january   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock  including  shares pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option  at a price to the public of per share  and received net proceeds of approximately million after the payment of underwriting discounts and expenses 
on march   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  and received net proceeds of approximately million after the payment of underwriting discounts and expenses 
as part of this transaction  we issued an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
we used the proceeds of our stock offerings to purchase additional agency securities  provide working capital  and to provide liquidity for our hedging strategy 
forward looking statements regarding liquidity based on our current portfolio  leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements  we believe that the net proceeds of our common equity offerings  combined with cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short term one year or less liquidity requirements such as to fund our investment activities  to pay fees under our management agreement  to fund our distributions to shareholders and for general corporate expenses 
our ability to meet our long term greater than one year liquidity and capital resource requirements will be subject to obtaining additional debt financing and equity capital 
we may increase our capital resources by obtaining long term credit facilities or making public or private offerings of equity or debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  and senior or subordinated notes 
such financing will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds 
if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on substantially similar terms  it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we generally seek to borrow on a recourse basis between six and times the amount of our shareholders equity 
at december  and december   our total borrowings were approximately billion and billion excluding accrued interest  respectively  which represented a leverage ratio of approximately and  respectively 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
interest income interest income is earned and recognized based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the actual lives of the securities using the effective interest method 
market valuation of investment securities we invest in agency securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of single family adjustable rate mortgage loans 
guidance under the financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic on investments requires us to classify our investments as either trading  available for sale or held to maturity securities 
management determines the appropriate classifications of the securities at the time they are acquired and evaluates the appropriateness of such classifications at each balance sheet date 
we currently classifies all of our agency securities as available for sale 
all assets that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income 
the estimated fair values of mbs are determined by management by obtaining valuations for our mbs from independent sources and averaging these valuations 
security purchase and sale transactions are recorded on the trade date 
gains or losses realized from the sale of securities are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method 
firm purchase commitments to acquire when issued or tba securities are recorded at fair value in accordance with asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
the fair value of these purchase commitments is included in other assets or liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
impairment of assets we assess our investment securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis 
when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which impairment is assessed  the impairment is designated as either temporary or other than temporary 
in deciding on whether or not a security is other than temporarily impaired  we use a two step evaluation process 
first  we determine whether we have made any decision to sell a security that is in an unrealized loss position  or  if not is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis 
if we determine that the answer to either of these questions is yes then the security is considered other than temporarily impaired 
there were no such impairment losses recognized during the periods presented 
derivative instruments we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the guidance included in the asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
this guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the guidance requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of income or be accumulated in other comprehensive income  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates generally with interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors directly influence our performance far more than inflation 
although inflation is a primary factor in any interest rate  changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with changes in inflation rates  and these affects may be imperfect or lagging 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and any distributions we may make will be determined by our board of directors based in part on our reit taxable income as calculated according to the requirements of the code  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to fair value without considering inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  or special purpose or variable interest entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  as of december  and  we had not guaranteed any obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets  interest rates  liquidity  prepayment speeds and market value while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to shareholders to realize attractive risk adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the primary component of our market risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations  as well as other factors beyond our control 
we will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and our related financing obligations 
interest rate effect on net interest income our operating results depend in large part on differences between the yields earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities 
the cost of our borrowings will generally be based on prevailing market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with agency securities tend to increase while the income earned on agency securities may remain substantially unchanged until the interest rates reset 
this results in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the assets and related borrowings and may even result in losses 
the severity of any such decline would depend on our asset liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase 
further  an increase in short term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our investments 
if any of these events happen  we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods  which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of longer term repurchase agreements and hedging instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to mitigate the effects of increases in interest rates under billion of our repurchase agreements 

table of contents hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our agency securities 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the agency securities will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
hedging techniques are also limited by the rules relating to reit qualification 
in order to preserve our reit status  we may be forced to terminate a hedging transaction at a time when the transaction is most needed 
interest rate cap risk the arms that underlie our agency securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors  which limit the amount by which the security s interest rate may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements will not be subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rate increases on our adjustable rate and hybrid agency securities could effectively be limited by caps 
agency securities backed by arms may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
this could result in our receipt of less cash from such investments than we would need to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would harm our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
interest rate mismatch risk we fund a substantial portion of our acquisition of agency securities with borrowings that are based on  or move similarly to  libor  while the interest rates on these agency securities may be indexed to libor or another index rate  such as the one year cmt rate 
accordingly  any increase in our borrowing rate relative to libor or one year cmt rates may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that is not matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these investments 
any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability  which may negatively impact distributions to our shareholders 
to seek to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above 
our analysis of risks is based on our manager s experience  estimates and assumptions  including estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager may produce results that differ significantly from our manager s estimates and assumptions 
prepayment risk as we receive repayments of principal on our agency securities from prepayments and scheduled payments  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when we acquire agency securities at prices in excess of the principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying such agency securities 
conversely  discounts arise when we acquire agency securities at prices below the principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying such agency securities 
to date  substantially all of our agency securities have been purchased at a premium 
for financial accounting purposes  interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
in general  purchase premiums on investment securities are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment and cash flow activity 
an increase in the principal repayment rate will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums and a decrease in the repayment rate will typically slow the accretion of purchase discounts  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 

table of contents when we receive repayments of principal on our agency securities from prepayments and scheduled payments  to maintain a similar rate of earnings per share  we may want to reinvest the proceeds from these repayments in similar yielding investments 
in addition  due to standard settlement conventions  it may take time to reinvest these proceeds and leave a gap in earnings until we can find and settle on suitable investment assets 
in times of market illiquidity or tight supply  we may have periods where similar types of assets are not available to replace those assets repaid to us 
a decrease in earnings could be significant in periods of high prepayments 
extension risk we invest in agency securities that are either fixed rate or backed by arms which have interest rates that are fixed for the early years of the loan typically three  five  or seven years and thereafter reset periodically  on the same basis as agency securities backed by arms 
we compute the projected weighted average life of our agency securities based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  when agency securities are acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated weighted average life of the fixed rate portion of the related agency securities 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates by fixing our borrowing costs for the duration of the fixed rate period of the mortgage loans underlying the related agency securities 
we may structure our interest rate swap agreements to expire in conjunction with the estimated weighted average life of the fixed period of the mortgage loans underlying our agency securities 
however  in a rising interest rate environment  the weighted average life of the mortgage loans underlying our agency securities could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this is sometimes referred to as tail risk 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the term of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the remaining agency securities would remain fixed for a period of time 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency securities to decline  with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur losses 
interest rate risk and effect on market value risk another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our agency securities 
we face the risk that the market value of our agency securities will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities  including our hedging instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effective duration of our assets and the effective duration of our liabilities  and by estimating the time difference between the interest rate adjustment of our assets and the interest rate adjustment of our liabilities 
effective duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally estimate effective duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same securities 
the sensitivity analysis tables presented below show the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve  up and down and basis points  on the market value of our interest rate sensitive investments and net interest income  at december  and  assuming a static portfolio 
when evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates  prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on our manager s expectations 
the analysis presented utilized assumptions  models and estimates of the manager based on the manager s judgment and experience 

table of contents december  change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value december  change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value while the charts above reflect the estimated immediate impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio  we rebalance our portfolio from time to time either to seek to take advantage of or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on market value and net interest income can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the market value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond amounts shown in the table above 
in addition  other factors impact the market value of and net interest income from our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  interest income would likely differ from that shown above  and such difference might be material and adverse to our shareholders 
the above table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value  which includes the value of swaps  should interest rates immediately change 
given the low level of interest rates at december  and  we applied a floor of  for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions 
due to presence of this floor  it is anticipated that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level  however  because prepayments speeds are unaffected by this floor  it is expected that any increase in our prepayment speeds occurring as a result of any interest rate decrease or otherwise could result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and the reinvestment of such prepaid principal in lower yielding assets 
as a result  because the presence of this floor limits the positive impact of any interest rate decrease on our funding costs 
therefore  at some point hypothetical interest rate decreases could cause the fair value of our financial instruments and our net interest income to decline
