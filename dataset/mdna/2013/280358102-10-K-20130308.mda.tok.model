headquartered in wakefield  massachusetts  as of december   our company employed approximately consulting professionals excluding contractors and total professionals excluding contractors 
factors influencing our results of operations revenue 
the company derives its service revenue from time and materials based contracts  fixed price contracts and retainer based arrangements 
time and materials based contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered and performed at contractually agreed upon rates 
fixed price contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue pursuant to fixed price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting 
retainer based contracts represented of service revenue for the year ended december  revenue under retainer based contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period  as outlined within the respective contract 
provisions for estimated profits or losses on incomplete projects are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined 
the company did not recognize any loss contracts during the years ended december   or on many projects  we are reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenue and cost of revenue 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel and whether our arrangements with our customers provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
in connection with our migration to more of a product based consulting model  software revenue will continue to be a significant portion of our revenues 
software revenue  driven by resales of microsoft dynamics ax product  represented  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
software and maintenance revenue are recognized upon delivery  except in the infrequent situation where the company provides maintenance services  in which case the related maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance period while the software revenue is recognized upon delivery 
software revenue is expected to fluctuate between quarters  dependent on our customers demand for such third party off the shelf software 
fluctuations in software revenue may have an impact upon our periodic operating performance  including gross margin 

table of contents operating expenses 
the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our project consulting personnel and related expenses 
non cash compensation includes share based compensation expense arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
project personnel expenses also consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with our professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting costs  third party vendor payments and non billable expenses associated with the delivery of services to our customers 
we consider the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue to be an important measure of our operating performance 
the relationship between project personnel expenses and revenue is driven largely by the chargeability of our consultant base  the prices we charge our customers and the non billable costs associated with securing new customer engagements and developing new service offerings 
the remainder of our recurring operating expense consists of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our customer serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations including finance  information systems  human resources  facilities including the rent of office space and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue levels 
in addition  we monitor the progress of customer projects with customer senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services that we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our customer engagements are terminable by our customers without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a customer project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of consulting professionals to oversee existing customer engagements and to participate in sales activities to secure new customer assignments 
adjustments to fair value of contingent consideration 
during the years ended december  and  we reported changes in the estimated fair value of certain acquisition related  contingent consideration liabilities 
we remeasure the estimated carrying value of contingent consideration each quarter  with any changes income or expense in the estimated fair value recorded as an operating expense 
changes in the carrying value of contingent consideration liabilities may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on changes in estimates  including probabilities associated with achieving the milestones and the period in which we estimate these milestones will be achieved 
in  the company recorded an expense  related to the change in fair value of the contingent earnout accrual  of million within selling  general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss as a result of the performance of fullscope s process contracts during the company settled the liability in the amount of million during the fourth quarter of and no further contingent earnout may be earned by the former fullscope stockholders 
in may and  meridian completed its first and second twelve month earnout periods  during which the required performance measurements were not achieved 
the former meridian stockholders did not receive any additional contingent consideration related to the first or second earnout periods 
the company  as of september   determined that no accrual was required for potential future contingent earnout consideration payable to the former meridian stockholders related to the completion of the third and final twelve month earnout period  which concludes in may as of december   the maximum amount of contingent earnout consideration that the former stockholders of meridian can earn is capped at thousand 

table of contents fullscope embezzlement expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred certain non routine professional service related expenses associated with our identification of embezzlement activities at fullscope  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries the fullscope embezzlement issue 
we incurred the majority of our embezzlement related expenses during fiscal in connection with our identification and investigation of the embezzlement activity 
while embezzlement related expenses decreased in and  we anticipate that we may continue to incur additional expenses associated with the fullscope embezzlement issue as we intend to aggressively pursue recovery through all possible avenues  including a claim against the escrow account established in connection with the fullscope acquisition and reimbursement under insurance policies 
we anticipate that we will be able to recover some  if not all  of the receivable amounts embezzled during  the professional service expenses we have incurred to date  or will incur in the future  addressing this situation  and any amounts paid to settle any of the identified sales and use tax liability amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to file tax returns and pay sales and use tax liabilities related to the fullscope embezzlement  and we expect to continue to do so through the first half of the company fully expects to be reimbursed for payments made in relation to amended sales and use tax returns  however reimbursement from escrow is not expected until resolution is reached on all outstanding embezzlement related sales and use tax amounts 
amounts recovered  if any  will be recorded during the period in which settlement is determined to be certain 
plans for growth and acquisitions 
our goal is to position our company as one of the leading providers of transformational classic and product based consulting services in north america by growing our customer base  leveraging our industry expertise to enhance our service offerings and continuing to make disciplined strategic acquisitions

company performance measurement systems and metrics 
the company s management monitors and assesses its operating performance by evaluating key metrics and indicators on an ongoing basis 
for example  we regularly review performance information related to annualized revenue per billable consultant  periodic consultant utilization rates  gross profit margins  average bill rates and billable employee headcount 
edgewater has also developed internal enterprise performance management systems which aid us in measuring our operating performance and consultant utilization rates 
the matching of sales opportunities to available skill sets in our consultant base is one of our greatest challenges  and therefore we monitor consultant utilization closely 
these metrics  along with other operating and financial performance metrics  are used in evaluating management s overall performance 
these metrics and indicators are discussed in more detail under results for the year ended december   compared to results for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k
