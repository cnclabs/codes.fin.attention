business strategies although new home demand remains at historically low levels  during fiscal the overall homebuilding market improved 
improved conditions in our markets resulted in our higher revenues and gross margins  increased contracts and deliveries and profitability for the first time since fiscal from to  the homebuilding industry had been in a prolonged downturn 
during that time  our primary focus  while market conditions were extremely weak  had been to strengthen our financial condition by reducing inventories of homes and land  controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs  maximizing cash flows  reducing outstanding debt  and maintaining strong liquidity 
in  we began to see opportunities to purchase land at prices and terms that made economic sense in light of our sales prices and sales paces 
as a result  since early  we have been more active in purchasing or putting under option new properties that meet or exceed our internal rate of return investment requirements 
deliveries from these newly acquired communities helped us achieve profitability in fiscal  and in order to continue to increase profitability in the future  we will need to continue purchasing new land that will generate good investment returns and drive greater operating efficiencies  as well as control expenses commensurate with our level of deliveries 
in addition to our current focus on maintaining strong liquidity and evaluating new investment opportunities  we intend to continue to focus on our historic key business strategies as enumerated below 
we believe that these strategies separate us from our competitors in the residential homebuilding industry and the adoption  implementation  and adherence to these principles will continue to benefit our business 
our goal is to become a significant builder in each of the selected markets in which we operate  which will enable us to achieve powers and economies of scale and differentiate ourselves from most of our competitors 
we offer a broad product array to provide housing to a wide range of customers 
our customers consist of first time buyers  first time and second time move up buyers  luxury buyers  active adult buyers  and empty nesters 
our diverse product array includes single family detached homes  attached townhomes and condominiums  urban infill  and active adult homes 
we are committed to customer satisfaction and quality in the homes that we build 
we recognize that our future success rests in the ability to deliver quality homes to satisfied customers 
we seek to expand our commitment to customer service through a variety of quality initiatives 
in addition  our focus remains on attracting and developing quality associates 
we use several leadership development and mentoring programs to identify key individuals and prepare them for positions of greater responsibility within our company 
we focus on achieving high return on invested capital 
each new community is evaluated based on its ability to meet or exceed internal rate of return requirements 
our belief is that the best way to create lasting value for our shareholders is through a strong focus on return on invested capital 
we prefer to use a risk averse land strategy 
we attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options  thereby limiting the financial exposure to the amounts invested in property and predevelopment costs 
this approach significantly reduces our risk and generally allows us to obtain necessary development approvals before acquisition of the land 
we enter into homebuilding and land development joint ventures from time to time as a means of controlling lot positions  expanding our market opportunities  establishing strategic alliances  reducing our risk profile  leveraging our capital base  and enhancing our returns on capital 
our homebuilding joint ventures are generally entered into with third party investors to develop land and construct homes that are sold directly to home buyers 
our land development joint ventures include those with developers and other homebuilders  as well as financial investors to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members or other third parties 
we manage our financial services operations to better serve all of our home buyers 
our current mortgage financing and title service operations enhance our contact with customers and allow us to coordinate the home buying experience from beginning to end 
operating policies and procedures we attempt to reduce the effect of certain risks inherent in the housing industry through the following policies and procedures training our training is designed to provide our associates with the knowledge  attitudes  skills  and habits necessary to succeed in their jobs 
our training department regularly conducts online or webinar training in sales  construction  administration  and managerial skills 
land acquisition  planning  and development before entering into a contract to acquire land  we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of such land acquisition 
we generally follow a policy of acquiring options to purchase land for future community developments 
where possible  we acquire land for future development through the use of land options  which need not be exercised before the completion of the regulatory approval process 
we attempt to structure these options with flexible takedown schedules rather than with an obligation to take down the entire parcel upon receiving regulatory approval 
if we are unable to negotiate flexible takedown schedules  we will buy parcels in a single bulk purchase 
additionally  we purchase improved lots in certain markets by acquiring a small number of improved lots with an option on additional lots 
this allows us to minimize the economic costs and risks of carrying a large land inventory  while maintaining our ability to commence new developments during favorable market periods 
our option and purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community 
generally  the deposit on the agreement will be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained  although predevelopment costs may not be recoverable 
by paying an additional nonrefundable deposit  we have the right to extend a significant number of our options for varying periods of time 
in most instances  we have the right to cancel any of our land option agreements by forfeiture of our deposit on the agreement 
in fiscal   and  rather than purchase additional lots in underperforming communities  we took advantage of this right and walked away from  lots   lots  and  lots  respectively  out of  total lots   total lots  and  total lots  respectively  under option  resulting in pretax charges of million  million  and million  respectively 
design our residential communities are generally located in suburban areas easily accessible through public and personal transportation 
our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics 
we strive to create diversity within the overall planned community by offering a mix of homes with differing architecture  textures  and colors 
recreational amenities  such as swimming pools  tennis courts  clubhouses  open areas  and tot lots  are frequently included 
construction we design and supervise the development and building of our communities 
our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes  which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction 
we generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and construction of homes 
agreements with subcontractors are generally short term and provide for a fixed price for labor and materials 
we rigorously control costs through the use of computerized monitoring systems 
because of the risks involved in speculative building  our general policy is to construct an attached condominium or townhouse building only after signing contracts for the sale of at least of the homes in that building 
a majority of our single family detached homes are constructed after the signing of a sales contract and mortgage approval has been obtained 
this limits the buildup of inventory of unsold homes and the costs of maintaining and carrying that inventory 
materials and subcontractors we attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources 
in addition  we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
we have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors 
in recent years  we have experienced no significant construction delays due to shortage of materials or labor  however  we cannot predict the extent to which shortages in necessary materials or labor may occur in the future 
marketing and sales our residential communities are sold principally through on site sales offices 
in order to respond to our customers needs and trends in housing design  we rely upon our internal market research group to analyze information gathered from  among other sources  buyer profiles  and exit interviews at model sites  focus groups  and demographic databases 
we make use of newspaper  radio  television  internet  magazine  our web site  billboard  video and direct mail advertising  special and promotional events  illustrated brochures  and full sized and scale model homes in our comprehensive marketing program 
in addition  we have home design galleries in our florida  illinois  new jersey  north carolina  and virginia markets  which offer a wide range of customer options to satisfy individual customer tastes 
customer service and quality control in many of our markets  associates are responsible for customer service and preclosing quality control inspections as well as responding to postclosing customer needs 
prior to closing  each home is inspected and any necessary completion work is undertaken by us 
our homes are enrolled in a standard limited warranty program which  in general  provides a homebuyer with a one year warranty for the home s materials and workmanship  a two year warranty for the home s heating  cooling  ventilating  electrical  and plumbing systems  and a year warranty for major structural defects 
all of the warranties contain standard exceptions  including  but not limited to  damage caused by the customer 
customer financing we sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages 
our financial services segment provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application  loan approval  and closing and title services 
we originate loans in arizona  california  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  maryland  minnesota  new jersey  north carolina  pennsylvania  south carolina  texas  virginia  and washington  dc we believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales 
during the year ended october   for the markets in which our mortgage subsidiaries originated loans  of our home buyers paid in cash and of our noncash home buyers obtained mortgages from our mortgage banking subsidiary 
the loans we originated in fiscal were federal housing administration veterans affairs fha va  prime  and united states department of agriculture 
we customarily sell virtually all of the loans and loan servicing rights that we originate within a short period of time 
loans are sold either individually or against forward commitments to institutional investors  including banks  mortgage banking firms  and savings and loan associations 
residential development activities our residential development activities include site planning and engineering  obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads  sewer  water  and drainage facilities  recreational facilities  and other amenities and marketing and selling homes 
these activities are performed by our associates  together with independent architects  consultants  and contractors 
our associates also carry out long term planning of communities 
a residential development generally includes single family detached homes and or a number of residential buildings containing from two to individual homes per building  together with amenities  such as club houses  swimming pools  tennis courts  tot lots  and open areas 
current base prices for our homes in contract backlog at october   range from  low income housing to  in the northeast  from  to  in the mid atlantic  from  to  in the midwest  from  to  in the southeast  from  to  in the southwest  and from  to  in the west 
closings generally occur and are typically reflected in revenues within months of when sales contracts are signed 
information on homes delivered by segment for the year ended october   is set forth below housing revenue in thousands housing revenues homes delivered average price northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total unconsolidated joint ventures total including unconsolidated joint ventures the value of our net sales contracts  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  increased to billion from billion for the years ended october  and  respectively

active selling communities communities approved homes homes delivered contracted not delivered remaining homes available northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes home sites under option 
of the total remaining homes available  were under construction or completed including models and sales offices  and  were under option 
backlog at october  and  including unconsolidated joint ventures  we had a backlog of signed contracts for  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating million and million  respectively 
the majority of our backlog at october   is expected to be completed and closed within the next months 
at november  and  our backlog of signed contracts  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating million and million  respectively 
for information on our backlog excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  see the table on page under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations homebuilding 
sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast  and some sections of the mid atlantic and midwest  we typically obtain an additional to down payment due within to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the contract 
when housing values decline in certain markets  some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
cancellation rates are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer  which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods 
however  revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received  and there is no continued involvement 
residential land inventory in planning it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  whenever possible  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land land owned and under option as of october   exclusive of communities under development described above under active selling communities and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable home sites in communities in planning are included in the  consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate table in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page communities in planning dollars in thousands number of proposed communities proposed developable home sites total land option price book value northeast under option owned total mid atlantic under option owned total midwest under option owned total southeast under option owned total southwest under option owned total west under option owned total totals under option owned combined total properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation 
for properties under option  as of october   option fees and deposits aggregated approximately million 
as of october   we spent an additional million in nonrefundable predevelopment costs on such properties 
we either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers 
under a typical agreement with the land developer  we purchase a minimal number of home sites 
the balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a nonrecourse purchase agreement 
during the declining homebuilding market  we decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities where we determined that current market conditions did not justify further investment at that time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on mothballed communities 
for additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
raw materials the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of or increase the cost of developing one or more of our residential communities 
we attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources 
in addition  we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
we have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature and  historically  weather related problems  typically in the fall  late winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs 
competition our homebuilding operations are highly competitive 
we are among the top homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service  and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules  and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction  and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement  and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth  or no growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  real estate markets  and weather and other environmental conditions  which could affect our ability to build homes at prices our customers are willing or able to pay  could reduce profits that may not be recaptured  could result in cancellation of sales contracts  and could affect our liquidity 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical  has from time to time experienced significant difficulties  and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as employment levels and job growth  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  foreclosure rates  inflation  adverse changes in tax laws  consumer confidence  housing demand  population growth  and availability of water supply in locations in which we operate 
turmoil in the financial markets could affect our liquidity 
in addition  our cash balances are primarily invested in short term government backed instruments 
the remaining cash balances are held at numerous financial institutions and may  at times  exceed insurable amounts 
we seek to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major financial institutions and diversifying our investments 
in addition  our homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit 
we recently entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility under which letters of credit may be issued 
we also have certain stand alone letter of credit facilities and agreements pursuant to which letters of credit are issued 
however  we may need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these facilities and agreements 
if we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business  we may be adversely affected 
weather conditions and man made or natural disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  droughts  fires  and other environmental conditions  can harm the local homebuilding business 
for example  our business in florida was adversely affected in late and into due to the effects of hurricane wilma on materials and labor availability and pricing 
conversely  hurricane ike  which hit houston in september  did not have an effect on materials and labor availability or pricing  but did affect the volume of home sales in subsequent weeks 
in august and october  hurricane irene and hurricane sandy  respectively  caused widespread flooding and disruptions on the atlantic seaboard  which impacted our sales and construction activity in affected markets during those months 
the difficulties described above could cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because we fix our prices up to months in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
in addition  some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether 
the homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained downturn which has  and could continue to  materially and adversely affect our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
the homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained downturn over the past several years 
an industry wide softening of demand for new homes resulted from a lack of consumer confidence  decreased availability of mortgage financing  and large supplies of resale and new home inventories  among other factors 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties  resale homes  and foreclosures  depressed prices  and reduced margins for the sale of new homes 
industry conditions had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in fiscal years through and may continue to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in future years 
further  we substantially increased our inventory through fiscal  which required significant cash outlays and which increased our price and margin exposure as we worked through this inventory 
general economic conditions in the united states remain weak 
several challenges  such as persistently high unemployment levels  national and global economic weakness and uncertainty  the restrictive mortgage lending environment  and the potential for more foreclosures  continue to threaten the recovery in the housing market 
in addition  both national new home sales and our home sales remain below historical levels 
until there is a more robust us economic recovery  we expect national demand for new homes to remain at historically low levels  with uneven improvement across our operating markets 
looking forward  although we have begun to see improvements  given instability in the housing market  it may continue to be difficult to generate positive cash flow especially as we invest in land to fund future homebuilding 
in addition  while our sales have increased  we saw lower sales in july through september in part due to increasing interest rates 
market volatility has been unprecedented and extraordinary in the last several years  and the resulting economic turmoil may continue to exacerbate industry conditions or have other unforeseen consequences  leading to uncertainty about future conditions in the homebuilding industry 
continuation or worsening of the downturn or general economic conditions would continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
in addition  an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages 
although substantially all of the mortgage loans we originate are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  non recourse basis  we remain liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
as default rates rise  this may increase our potential exposure regarding mortgage loan sales because investors may seek to have us buy back or make whole investors for mortgages we previously sold 
to date  we have not made significant payments related to our mortgage loans  but because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters  actual future payments could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
during the industry downturn  the housing market benefited from a number of government programs  including tax credits for home buyers provided by the federal government and certain state governments  including california  and support of the mortgage market  including through purchases of mortgage backed securities by the federal reserve bank and the underwriting of a substantial amount of new mortgages by the federal housing administration fha and other governmental agencies 
these programs are expected to wind down over time  for example  the california tax credit ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the federal tax credit expired in april in addition  in fiscal  the us department of housing and urban development hud tightened fha underwriting standards 
the maximum size of mortgage loans that are treated as conforming by fannie mae and freddie mac was reduced on october   which could further weaken home sales in general as mortgages may become more expensive and  if conforming loan limits are further reduced as currently expected to occur on january   it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
housing markets may further decline as these programs are modified or terminated 
our leverage places burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness  may restrict our ability to operate  may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations  and may adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our debt excluding nonrecourse secured debt and debt of our financial subsidiaries  as of october   including the debt of the subsidiaries that guarantee our debt  was  million  million net of discount  and our debt service payments for the month period ended october   were million  substantially all of which represented interest incurred and the remainder of which represented payments on the principal of our amortizing notes  and do not include principal and interest on nonrecourse secured debt  debt of our financial subsidiaries and fees under our letter of credit and other credit facilities and agreements 
in addition  as of october   we had million in aggregate outstanding face amount of letters of credit issued under various letter of credit and other credit facilities and agreements  certain of which were collateralized by million of cash 
our fees for these letters of credit for the year ended october   which are based on both the used and unused portion of the facilities and agreements  were million 
we also had substantial contractual commitments and contingent obligations  including approximately million of performance bonds as of october  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
our significant amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  or other requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors  and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business and general economic conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance 
we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles 
our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve 
our businesses are also affected by customer sentiment and financial  political  business  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of equity securities  the refinancing of debt  or the sale of assets 
changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations to the extent we have any floating rate indebtedness 
a higher interest rate on our debt service obligations could result in lower earnings or increased losses 
our sources of liquidity are limited and may not be sufficient to meet our needs 
we are largely dependent on our current cash balance and future cash flows from operations which may not be positive to enable us to service our indebtedness  to cover our operating expenses  and or to fund our other liquidity needs 
although we generated million of cash in operating activities in the fiscal year ended october   for the prior two years we generated negative cash flow  and currently expect to continue to generate slightly positive or negative cash flow  after taking into account land purchases 
if the homebuilding industry does not experience improved conditions over the next several years  our cash flows could be insufficient to fund our obligations and support land purchases  if we cannot buy additional land we would ultimately be unable to generate future revenues from the sale of houses 
in addition  we may need to further refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital  or restructure our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful or  if successful  made on desirable terms and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations 
we have also entered into certain cash collateralized letters of credit agreements and facilities that require us to maintain specified amounts of cash in segregated accounts as collateral to support our letters of credit issued thereunder 
if our available cash and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service and other obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
for additional information about capital resources and liquidity  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to operate and if our financial performance worsens  we may not be able to undertake transactions within the restrictions of our debt instruments 
the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities and our revolving credit facility impose certain restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries operations and activities 
the most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence  creating liens  sales of assets  cash distributions  including paying dividends on common and preferred stock  capital stock and debt repurchases  and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
because of these restrictions  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our common and preferred stock and anticipate that we will remain prohibited for the foreseeable future 
the restrictions in our debt instruments could prohibit or restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries activities  such as undertaking capital raising or restructuring activities or entering into other transactions 
in such a situation  we may be unable to amend the instrument or obtain a waiver 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payments on this debt and other material indebtedness  our debt under these debt instruments could become due and payable prior to maturity 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
either situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the company 
the terms of our debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness 
under the terms of our indebtedness under our indentures and under our revolving credit facility  we have the ability  subject to our debt covenants  to incur additional amounts of debt 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness could magnify the risks described above 
in addition  certain obligations  such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds issued in the ordinary course of business  including those issued under our stand alone letter of credit agreements and facilities  are not considered indebtedness under our debt instruments and may be secured  and therefore  are not subject to limits in our debt covenants 
we could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to service our indebtedness to cover our operating expenses and to fund our other liquidity needs 
for example  during fiscal and thereafter  credit agencies took a series of negative actions  including downgrades  with respect to their credit ratings of us and our debt 
downgrades may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital 
therefore  any further downgrade by any of the principal credit agencies may exacerbate these difficulties 
although certain of our credit ratings have recently been upgraded  there can be no assurances that our credit ratings will not be further downgraded in the future  whether as a result of deteriorating general economic conditions  a more protracted downturn in the housing industry  failure to successfully implement our operating strategy  the adverse impact on our results of operations or liquidity position of any of the above  or otherwise 
our business is seasonal in nature and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season 
the construction of a customer s home typically begins after signing the agreement of sale and can take months or more to complete 
weather related problems  typically in the fall  winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability 
in addition  delays in opening communities could have an adverse effect on our sales and revenues 
due to these factors  our quarterly operating results will likely continue to fluctuate 
our success depends on the availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to fund such investments 
our success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices 
the availability of undeveloped land and improved lots for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the risk of competitive over bidding on land and lots and restrictive governmental regulation 
should suitable land opportunities become less available  the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced  which would reduce revenue and profits 
in addition  our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
we may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our significant debt obligations  which require substantial cash resources 
raw material and labor shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results 
the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
for example  manufacturers have increased the price of drywall in by approximately as compared to the prior year  and there is a potential for significant future price increases 
in addition  we contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
therefore  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability  skill  and cost of our subcontractors 
delays or cost increases caused by shortages and price fluctuations could harm our operating results  the impact of which may be further affected depending on our ability to raise sales prices to offset increased costs 
we have experienced some labor shortages and increased labor costs in recent months 
changes in economic and market conditions could result in the sale of homes at a loss or holding land in inventory longer than planned  the cost of which can be significant 
land inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders 
we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for expansion into new markets and for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets 
the market value of undeveloped land  buildable lots  and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned 
in the case of land options  we could choose not to exercise them  in which case we would write off the value of these options 
inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies 
for example  while in fiscal and  we did not have significant land option write offs or impairments  during fiscal   and  we decided not to exercise many option contracts and walked away from land option deposits and predevelopment costs  which resulted in land option write offs of million  million  and million  respectively 
also  in fiscal   and  as a result of the difficult market conditions  we recorded inventory impairment losses on owned property of million  million  and million  respectively 
if market conditions worsen  additional inventory impairment losses and land option write offs will likely be necessary 
home prices and sales activities in the arizona  california  new jersey  and texas  markets have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in these markets 
we presently conduct a significant portion of our business in the arizona  california  new jersey  and texas  markets 
home prices and sales activities in these markets and in most of the other markets in which we operate have declined from time to time  particularly as a result of slow economic growth 
furthermore  precarious economic and budget situations at the state government level may adversely affect the market for our homes in those affected areas 
if home prices and sales activity decline in one or more of the markets in which we operate  our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and may negatively impact our results of operations 
because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing  increases in interest rates or the decreased availability of mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes  lower demand for our products  limit our marketing effectiveness  and limit our ability to fully realize our backlog 
virtually all of our customers finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing 
increases in interest rates or the perception that interest rates will rise  including as a result of government actions or decreases in availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs to potential home buyers 
even if potential customers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
this could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts generally include a financing contingency 
financing contingencies permit the customer to cancel its obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates  including financing arranged or provided by us  is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period is typically four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the sales contract 
starting in  many lenders have been significantly tightening their underwriting standards  and subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer being made available in the marketplace 
if these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain  the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected  which will adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we believe that the availability of mortgage financing  including federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corp  and fha va financing  is an important factor in marketing many of our homes 
the maximum size of mortgage loans that are treated as conforming by fannie mae and freddie mac was reduced on october   which could further weaken home sales in general as mortgages may become more expensive and  if conforming loan limits are further reduced as currently expected to occur on january   it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  hud continues to tighten fha underwriting standards 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our sales 
increases in the after tax costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 
significant expenses of owning a home  including mortgage interest expenses and real estate taxes  generally are deductible expenses for an individual s federal  and in some cases state  income taxes  subject to limitations under current tax law and policy 
if the federal government or a state government were to change its income tax laws to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions  as has been discussed from time to time  the after tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers 
the loss or reduction of these homeowner tax deductions  if such tax law changes were enacted without any offsetting legislation  would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes  including ours 
in addition  increases in property tax rates or fees on developers by local governmental authorities  as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding or to fund local initiatives  such as funding schools or road improvements  can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes  and can have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
we conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
we currently operate through a number of unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
at october   we had invested an aggregate of million in these joint ventures  including advances to these joint ventures of approximately million 
in addition  as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate additional joint venture opportunities 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
there are a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition  development  and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures  and if market conditions become more challenging  it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms 
over the past few years  we have been unable to obtain financing for newly created joint ventures 
in addition  we lack a controlling interest in these joint ventures and  therefore  are usually unable to require that our joint ventures sell assets or return invested capital  make additional capital contributions  or take any other action without the vote of at least one of our venture partners 
therefore  absent partner agreement  we will be unable to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash 
homebuilders are subject to a number of federal  local  state  and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land  the homebuilding  sales  and customer financing processes and the protection of the environment  which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas 
we are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and homebuilding  sales and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards and mortgage financing 
these laws and regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
in light of recent developments in the home building industry and the financial markets  federal  state  or local governments may seek to adopt regulations that limit or prohibit homebuilders from providing mortgage financing to their customers 
if adopted  any such regulations could adversely affect future revenues and earnings 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws and regulations that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws and regulations may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
for example  we engaged in discussions with the us environmental protection agency epa and the us department of justice doj regarding alleged violations of storm water discharge requirements 
in resolution of this matter  in april  we agreed to the terms of a consent decree with the epa  doj and the states of virginia  maryland  west virginia and the district of columbia collectively  the states 
the consent decree was approved by the federal district court in august under the terms of the consent decree  we paid a fine of million collectively to the united states and the states named above and have agreed to perform under the terms of the consent decree for a minimum of three years  which includes implementing certain operational and training measures nationwide to facilitate ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
we received in october a notice from region iii of the epa concerning stipulated penalties  totaling approximately  based on the extent to which we reportedly did not meet certain compliance performance specified in the previously reported consent decree entered into in august  we have since paid the stipulated penalties as assessed  and more recently have paid approximately  in response to an epa demand received in june for stipulated penalties based on information about our performance under the consent decree for the consent decree was terminated by court order without objection in december in march  we received a letter from the epa requesting information about our involvement in a housing redevelopment project in newark  new jersey that a company entity undertook during the s 
we understand that the development is in the vicinity of a former lead smelter and that recent tests on soil samples from properties within the development conducted by the epa show elevated levels of lead 
we also understand that the smelter operated before the city of newark acquired properties  demolished structures existing on them  and sold the properties to the company entity in connection with the redevelopment project 
we responded to the epa s request 
in august  we were notified that the epa considers us a potentially responsible party or prp with respect to the site  that the epa believes the site requires cleanup  and that the epa is proposing that we address contamination at the site 
we have begun preliminary discussions with the epa concerning a possible resolution but do not know the scope or extent of the company s obligations  if any  that may arise from the site and  therefore cannot provide any assurance that this matter will not have a material impact on the company 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretations and application 
several other homebuilders have received inquiries from regulatory agencies regarding the potential for homebuilders using contractors to be deemed employers of the employees of their contractors under certain circumstances 
contractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the industry  however  if regulatory agencies reclassify the employees of contractors as employees of homebuilders  homebuilders using contractors could be responsible for wage  hour  and other employment related liabilities of their contractors 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
for example  in the past we have received construction defect and home warranty claims associated with  and we were involved in a multidistrict litigation concerning  allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall that may have been responsible for noxious smells and accelerated corrosion of certain metals in certain homes we have constructed 
we remediated certain homes in response to such claims and settled the litigation 
in addition  the amount and scope of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited  and this coverage may be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against such claims  if the costs associated with such claims significantly exceed the amount of our insurance coverage  or if our insurers do not pay on claims under our policies whether because of dispute  inability  or otherwise  we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results 
our financial results could also be adversely affected if we were to experience an unusually high number of claims or unusually severe claims 
our insurance companies have the right to review our claims and claims history  and do so from time to time  and could decline to pay on such claims if such reviews determine the claims did not meet the terms for coverage 
additionally  we may need to significantly increase our construction defect and home warranty reserves as a result of insurance not being available for any of the reasons discussed above  such claims or the results of our annual actuarial study 
mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties 
our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  nonrecourse basis  although we remain liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
accordingly  mortgage investors have in the past and could in the future seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties 
we believe there continues to be an industry wide issue with the number of purchaser claims in which purchasers purport to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements 
we have established reserves for potential losses  however  there can be no assurance that we will not have significant liabilities in respect of such claims in the future  which could exceed our reserves  or that the impact of such claims on our results of operations will not be material 
we compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources  which could hurt future earnings 
we compete not only for home buyers but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials  and skilled labor often within larger subdivisions designed  planned  and developed by other homebuilders 
our competitors include other local  regional  and national homebuilders  some of which have greater sales and financial resources 
the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry together with current market conditions have  and could continue to  result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  increased selling incentives  lower sales  or delays in construction 
any of these problems could increase costs and or lower profit margins 
we may have difficulty in obtaining the additional financing required to operate and develop our business 
our operations require significant amounts of cash  and we may be required to seek additional capital  whether from sales of debt or equity securities or borrowing additional money  for the future growth and development of our business 
the terms or availability of additional capital is uncertain 
moreover  the agreements governing our outstanding debt instruments contain provisions that restrict the debt we may incur in the future and our ability to pay dividends on equity 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital  it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations 
in addition  pledging substantially all of our assets to support our senior secured notes may make it more difficult to raise additional financing in the future 
our future growth may include additional acquisitions of companies that may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve expected benefits 
acquisitions of companies have contributed to our historical growth and may again be a component of our growth strategy in the future 
in the future  we may acquire businesses  some of which may be significant 
as a result of acquisitions of companies  we may need to seek additional financing and integrate product lines  dispersed operations  and distinct corporate cultures 
these integration efforts may not succeed or may distract our management from operating our existing business 
additionally  we may not be able to enhance our earnings as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to successfully identify and manage future acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our controlling stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over us 
members of the hovnanian family  including ara k 
hovnanian  our chairman of the board  president  and chief executive officer  have voting control  through personal holdings  the limited partnership and the limited liability company established for members of mr 
hovnanian s family  family trusts and shares held by the estate of our former chairman  kevork s 
hovnanian  of class a and class b common stock that enables them to cast approximately of the votes that may be cast by the holders of our outstanding class a and class b common stock combined 
their combined stock ownership enables them to exert significant control over us  including power to control the election of the board of directors and to approve matters presented to our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may also make some transactions  including mergers or other changes in control  more difficult or impossible without their support 
also  because of their combined voting power  circumstances may occur in which their interests could be in conflict with the interests of other stakeholders 
our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
based on recent impairments and our current financial performance  we generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of billion through the fiscal year ended october   and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years 
section of the internal revenue code the code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change  which is generally any change in ownership of more than of its stock over a three year period  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses recognized in years after the ownership change 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our stock  including purchases or sales of stock between shareholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built in losses would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitation  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
a limitation imposed under section on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  we announced that the board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the code  and on december   our stockholders approved the board s decision to adopt the rights plan 
the rights plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring or more of our outstanding class a common stock any such person an acquiring person  without the approval of the company s board of directors 
subject to the terms  provisions and conditions of the rights plan  if and when they become exercisable  each right would entitle its holder to purchase from the company one ten thousandth of a share of the company s series b junior preferred stock for a purchase price of per share the purchase price 
the rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of i business days after a public announcement by us that a person or group has become an acquiring person and ii business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by a person or group for of the class a common stock the distribution date 
if issued  each fractional share of series b junior preferred stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend  voting and liquidation rights as does one share of the company s class a common stock 
however  prior to exercise  a right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the company  including without limitation any dividend  voting  or liquidation rights 
after the distribution date  each holder of a right  other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person which will thereupon become void  will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a right and payment of the purchase price  that number of shares of class a common stock or class b common stock  as the case may be  having a market value of two times the purchase price 
after the distribution date  our board of directors may exchange the rights other than rights owned by an acquiring person which will have become void  in whole or in part  at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock  or a fractional share of series b junior preferred stock or of a share of a similar class or series of hovnanian s preferred stock having similar rights  preferences  and privileges of equivalent value  per right subject to adjustment 
in addition  on december   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to restrict certain transfers of our common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the code 
subject to certain exceptions pertaining to pre existing stockholders and class b stockholders  the transfer restrictions in the amended certificate of incorporation generally restrict any direct or indirect transfer such as transfers of the company s stock that result from the transfer of interests in other entities that own the company s stock if the effect would be to i increase the direct or indirect ownership of the company s stock by any person or public group from less than to or more of the company s stock  ii increase the percentage of the company s stock owned directly or indirectly by a person or public group owning or deemed to own or more of the company s stock  or iii create a new public group as defined in the applicable united states treasury regulations 
utility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in prior years  the areas in which we operate in california have experienced power shortages  including periods without electrical power  as well as significant fluctuations in utility costs 
we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such power shortages and outages and utility rate fluctuations continue 
furthermore  power shortages and outages and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate  which may reduce demand for our homes 
our operations may be adversely affected if further rate fluctuations and or power shortages and outages occur in california  the northeast  or in our other markets 
geopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
geopolitical events  such as the aftermath of the war with iraq and the continuing involvement in afghanistan  may have a substantial impact on the economy and the housing market 
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september  had an impact on our business and the occurrence of similar events in the future cannot be ruled out 
the war and the continuing involvement in afghanistan  terrorism  and related geopolitical risks have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may have additional material adverse effects on the us economy  our customers and  in turn  our results of operations and financial condition

due to restrictions in our indentures for our senior and senior secured notes  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our preferred stock and did not make any dividend payments in fiscal     and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during fiscal  the housing market continued to strengthen  and  as a result  we experienced further positive operating trends  including improvements in several metrics for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   such as net contract growth of  an increase in gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges  from to and a decrease in selling  general and administrative costs including corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue from to 
in addition  our contract cancellation rate was for fiscal  which is below what we believe to be a normalized level of approximately 
active selling communities were and at october  and  respectively 
net contracts per average active selling community increased to for the year ended october   compared to in the same period in the prior year 
net contracts for the fourth quarter of fiscal were below the same period of the prior year as a result of the slowdown in the housing market due to the adverse impacts of higher mortgage rates  the sequester and the government shutdown 
however  this negative trend reversed in october and november of  where net contracts increased slightly over the same periods of the prior year 
our gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges  and selling  general and administrative costs including corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues also had favorable variances when comparing sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal to the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin percentage increased from to and selling  general and administrative costs including corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from to  as compared to the third quarter of fiscal cost of sales and selling  general and administrative costs include some fixed costs that are not impacted by delivery volume 
therefore  as deliveries increased from the third quarter of fiscal to the fourth quarter of fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues improved 
the increase in gross margin percentage partially resulted from the delivery volume increase  but also was the result of higher home prices that exceeded increased construction costs in certain markets and an increase in the percentage of deliveries from newly identified communities which we define as communities that were controlled subsequent to january   which generally have higher gross margins than our older communities 
while we are encouraged by the positive operating trends that began in fiscal and continued into fiscal  several challenges  such as persistently high unemployment levels  national and global economic weakness and uncertainty  the restrictive mortgage lending environment  higher mortgage interest rates and the potential for more foreclosures  continue to threaten a recovery in the housing market 
our recent operating results and other national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes has continued to improve 
however  both national new home sales and our home sales remain below historical levels 
until there is a more robust us economic recovery  we expect national demand for new homes to remain at below normal levels  with uneven improvement across our operating markets 
during the prolonged downturn of the housing market  we adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and shortened our land pipeline  reduced production volumes  and balanced home price and profitability with sales pace 
we delayed and cancelled planned land purchases  renegotiated land prices  and significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we significantly reduced our total number of speculative homes put into production 
since january  however  we began to see more opportunities to purchase land at prices that made economic sense in light of our then current sales prices and sales paces and plan to continue pursuing such land acquisitions 
new land purchases at pricing that we believe will generate appropriate investment returns and drive greater operating efficiencies are needed to return to sustained profitability 
during fiscal  we opened for sale new communities  purchased approximately  lots within newly identified communities which we define as communities that were controlled subsequent to january   and optioned approximately  lots in newly identified communities 
as we have experienced increased sales pace over the past year  causing communities to sell out more rapidly  we continue to consider and make new land acquisitions to replenish or grow our community count 
as a result  our active community count increased by communities from october  to communities at october  we have also continued to closely evaluate and control selling  general and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses 
while homebuilding selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million for fiscal  in connection with our increased revenues  these expenses as a percentage of total homebuilding revenues decreased from to due to the revenue growth across our operating segments 
corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal given the persistence of difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with accounting standards certification asc  property  plant and equipment real estate sales asc  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received  and there is no continued involvement 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment or continuing investment as prescribed by asc  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
income recognition from mortgage loans our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
we elected the fair value option for our mortgage loans held for sale in accordance with asc  financial instruments  which permits us to measure our loans held for sale at fair value 
management believes that the election of the fair value option for loans held for sale improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  nonrecourse basis  although the company remains liable for certain limited representations  such as fraud  and warranties related to loan sales 
mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgages we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations and warranties 
we believe there continues to be an industry wide issue with the number of purchaser claims in which purchasers purport to have found inaccuracies related to the sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements 
we have established reserves for probable losses 
inventories inventories consist of land  land development  home construction costs  capitalized interest  and construction overhead and property taxes 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
we record inventories in our consolidated balance sheets at cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired  in which case the inventory is written down to its fair value 
our inventories consist of the following three components sold and unsold homes and lots under development  which includes all construction  land  capitalized interest  and land development costs related to started homes and land under development in our active communities  land and land options held for future development or sale  which includes all costs related to land in our communities in planning or mothballed communities  and consolidated inventory not owned  which includes all costs related to specific performance options  variable interest entities  and other options  which consists primarily of model homes financed with an investor and inventory related to land banking arrangements 
we decide to mothball or stop development on certain communities when we determine that current market conditions do not justify further investment at that time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified on our consolidated balance sheets from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
as of october   the net book value associated with our mothballed communities was million  net of impairment charges recorded in prior periods of million 
we regularly review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
during fiscal  we mothballed one community  re activated three previously mothballed communities  and sold one mothballed community 
from time to time we enter into option agreements that include specific performance requirements  whereby we are required to purchase a minimum number of lots 
because of our obligation to purchase these lots  for accounting purposes in accordance with asc  we are required to record this inventory on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   we had million of specific performance options recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to consolidated inventory not owned specific performance options  with a corresponding amount recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned 
consolidated inventory not owned other options consists of certain model sale leasebacks and land banking arrangements  and other options that were included on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap 
during fiscal  we sold and leased back certain of our model homes with the right to participate in the potential profit when each home is sold to a third party at the end of the respective lease 
as a result of our continued involvement  for accounting purposes in accordance with asc  these sale and leaseback transactions are considered a financing rather than a sale 
therefore  for purposes of our consolidated balance sheet  at october   inventory of million was recorded to consolidated inventory not owned other options  with a corresponding amount of million recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned 
in addition  we entered into a land banking arrangement in fiscal with gso capital partners lp gso  that continued in fiscal  whereby we sold a portfolio of our land parcels to gso  and gso provided us an option to purchase back finished lots on a quarterly basis 
because of our option to repurchase these parcels  for accounting purposes  in accordance with asc  this transaction is considered a financing rather than a sale 
for purposes of our consolidated balance sheet  at october   inventory of million was recorded as consolidated inventory not owned other options  with a corresponding amount of million recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned for the amount of net cash received from the transactions 
the recoverability of inventories and other long lived assets is assessed in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant and equipment overall asc 
asc requires long lived assets  including inventories  held for development to be evaluated for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows of the assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
as such  we evaluate inventories for impairment at the individual community level  the lowest level of discrete cash flows that we measure 
we evaluate inventories of communities under development and held for future development for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in local housing market values  decreases in gross margins or sales absorption rates  decreases in net sales prices base sales price net of sales incentives  or actual or projected operating or cash flow losses 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly 
as part of this process  we prepare detailed budgets for all of our communities at least semi annually and identify those communities with a projected operating loss 
for those communities with projected losses  we estimate the remaining undiscounted future cash flows and compare those to the carrying value of the community  to determine if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable 
the projected operating profits  losses  or cash flows of each community can be significantly impacted by our estimates of the following future base selling prices  future home sales incentives  future home construction and land development costs  and future sales absorption pace and cancellation rates 
these estimates are dependent upon specific market conditions for each community 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a quarterly reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
local market specific conditions that may impact our estimates for a community include the intensity of competition within a market  including available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors  the current sales absorption pace for both our communities and competitor communities  community specific attributes  such as location  availability of lots in the market  desirability and uniqueness of our community  and the size and style of homes currently being offered  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  changes by management in the sales strategy of the community  current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends of forecasts  and existing home inventory supplies  including foreclosures and short sales 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by management in preparing projection assumptions for each community 
the sales objectives can differ between our communities  even within a given market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
in addition  the key assumptions included in our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in homes sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace and selling strategies  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful 
if the undiscounted cash flows are more than the carrying value of the community  then the carrying amount is recoverable  and no impairment adjustment is required 
however  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then the community is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each community by determining the present value of its estimated future cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the respective community  or in limited circumstances  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale  and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
our discount rates used for all impairments recorded from october  to october  ranged from to 
the estimated future cash flow assumptions are virtually the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value  including discount rates  decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a relative fair value basis 
from time to time  we write off deposits and approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs when we determine that it is no longer probable that we will exercise options to buy land in specific locations or when we redesign communities and or abandon certain engineering costs 
in deciding not to exercise a land option  we take into consideration changes in market conditions  the timing of required land takedowns  the willingness of land sellers to modify terms of the land option contract including timing of land takedowns  and the availability and best use of our capital  among other factors 
the write off is recorded in the period it is deemed not probable that the optioned property will be acquired 
in certain instances  we have been able to recover deposits and other pre acquisition costs that were previously written off 
these recoveries have not been significant in comparison to the total costs written off 
inventories held for sale are land parcels ready for sale in their current condition  where we have decided not to build homes but are instead actively marketing for sale 
these land parcels represented million of our total inventories at october   and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining fair value for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible under our general liability insurance is million per occurrence for construction defect and warranty claims 
for bodily injury claims  our deductible per occurrence in fiscal and is million and million  respectively  up to a million limit 
our aggregate retention in and is million for construction defect  warranty and bodily injury claims 
we do not have a deductible on our worker compensation insurance 
reserves for estimated losses for construction defects  warranty  bodily injury and workers compensation claims have been established using the assistance of a third party actuary 
we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty and construction defect data and worker compensation data to assist our management in estimating our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and worker compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
land options deposits on options to acquire improved or unimproved home sites and pre development costs incurred on this land under option are capitalized 
such amounts are either included as part of the purchase price if the land is acquired or charged to operations if we determine we will not exercise the option 
if the options are with variable interest entities and we are the primary beneficiary  we record the land under option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
the evaluation of whether or not we are the primary beneficiary can require significant judgment 
similarly  if the option obligation is to purchase under specific performance or has terms that require us to record it as financing  then we record the option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
we record costs associated with other options on the consolidated balance sheets under land and land options held for future development or sale 
unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interest in joint ventures varies but our voting interests are generally less than or equal to 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we assess whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agreements require that both partners agree on establishing the significant operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
the evaluation of whether or not we control a venture can require significant judgment 
in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures overall asc  we assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability  and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary  we write down the investment to its fair value 
we evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint venture s projected cash flows 
this process requires significant management judgment and estimates 
during fiscal and fiscal  there were no write downs of our joint venture investments 
post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
we accrue for warranty costs that are covered under our existing general liability and construction defect policy as part of our general liability insurance deductible 
this accrual is expensed as selling  general  and administrative costs 
for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible under our general liability insurance is million per occurrence for construction defect and warranty claims 
for bodily injury claims  our deductible per occurrence in fiscal and is million and million  respectively  up to a million limit 
our aggregate retention in fiscal and is million for construction defect  warranty and bodily injury claims 
in addition  we establish a warranty accrual for lower cost related issues to cover home repairs  community amenities  and land development infrastructure that are not covered under our general liability and construction defect policy 
we accrue an estimate for these warranty costs as part of cost of sales at the time each home is closed and title and possession have been transferred to the homebuyer 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the amount of warranty costs recognized in cost of goods sold and administrative expenses 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  income taxes overall asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
see total taxes below under results of operations for further discussion of the valuation allowances 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  for more likely than not exposures 
we re evaluate the exposures associated with our tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new audit activity  and effectively settled issues 
determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  or the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a liability that is materially different from our current estimate 
any such changes will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented that we believe will materially impact our financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in the northeast new jersey  pennsylvania  the mid atlantic delaware  maryland  virginia  washington dc  west virginia  the midwest illinois  minnesota  ohio  the southeast florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  the southwest arizona  texas  and the west california 
in addition  we provide certain financial services to our homebuilding customers 
we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities when we have had such facilities for our homebuilding operations and the issuance of new debt and equity securities 
during the prolonged housing market downturn that began in late  we had been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows from operations through reductions in assets during fiscal through fiscal the generation of cash flow  together with debt repurchases and exchanges at prices below par  allowed us to reduce debt notes payable  excluding accrued interest during fiscal by approximately million 
since the latter half of fiscal  we have seen more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense given the then current home sales prices and sales paces 
as such  since that time  despite acquiring new land at higher levels than in the previous few years  we have been able to further reduce our debt by approximately million 
our homebuilding cash balance at october  increased by million from october  the significant uses of cash during fiscal were primarily due to spending million on land and land development 
the remaining change in cash came from normal operations  as well a million reduction of homebuilding restricted cash 
most of this restricted cash became unrestricted as the letters of credit the cash collateralized were released during fiscal our cash uses during fiscal and were for operating expenses  land purchases  land deposits  land development  construction spending  financing transactions  debt payments and repurchases  state income taxes  interest payments and investments in joint ventures 
during these periods  we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand  financing transactions  debt and equity issuances  housing and land sales  model sale leasebacks  land banking deals  financial service revenues and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash will be sufficient through fiscal to finance our working capital requirements and other needs 
in june  we enhanced our liquidity by entering into a million unsecured revolving credit facility  discussed below 
our net income loss historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income loss and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  mortgage loans held for sale  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable and other liabilities  and noncash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory 
when we are expanding our operations  inventory levels  prepaids  and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increases  but for cash flow purposes net income is offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what happened during the last half of fiscal through fiscal  allowing us to generate positive cash flow from operations during this period 
since the latter part of fiscal cumulative through the first three quarters of fiscal  as a result of the new land purchases and land development we have used cash in operations as we add new communities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we generated a positive cash flow from operations  which was the result of a high volume of home deliveries 
looking forward  given the unstable housing market  it will continue to be difficult to generate positive cash flow from operations until we return to sustained profitability 
however  we will continue to make adjustments to our structure and our business plans in order to maximize our liquidity while also taking steps to return to sustained profitability  including through land acquisitions 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
we did not repurchase any shares under this program during fiscal or during fiscal  we repurchased million shares under this program 
as of october   the maximum number of shares of class a common stock that may yet be purchased under this program is million 
see part ii  item for information on equity purchases 
on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock 
the depositary shares are listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol hovnp 
in fiscal   and  we did not make any dividend payments on the series a preferred stock as a result of covenant restrictions in our debt instruments 
we anticipate that we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends  which are not cumulative  for the foreseeable future 
on october   k 
hovnanian enterprises  inc k 
hovnanian issued million million net of discount of senior secured notes due october  the notes were secured  subject to permitted liens and other exceptions  by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets owned by us  k 
hovnanian and the guarantors 
the net proceeds from this issuance  together with cash on hand  were used to fund certain cash tender offers for our then outstanding senior secured notes due and senior secured notes due and certain series of our unsecured notes 
in may  we issued million of additional senior secured notes as discussed below 
the senior secured notes due were the subject of a tender offer in october  and the notes that were not tendered in the tender offer were redeemed  as discussed below 
on february   we issued  shares of our class a common stock  including  shares issued pursuant to the over allotment option granted to the underwriters  at a price of per share 
on february   we issued an aggregate of  tangible equity units the teus  and on february   we issued an additional  teus pursuant to the over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
each teu initially consists of i a prepaid stock purchase contract each a purchase contract and ii a senior subordinated amortizing note due february  each  a senior subordinated amortizing note 
as of october  and  we had an aggregate principal amount of million and million  respectively  of senior subordinated amortizing notes outstanding 
on each february  may  august and november  k 
hovnanian will pay holders of senior subordinated amortizing notes equal quarterly cash installments of per senior subordinated amortizing note  which cash payments in the aggregate will be equivalent to per year with respect to each stated amount of teus 
each installment constitutes a payment of interest at a rate of per annum and a partial repayment of principal on the senior subordinated amortizing notes  allocated as set forth in the amortization schedule provided in the indenture under which the senior subordinated amortizing notes were issued 
the senior subordinated amortizing notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of february  if we elect to settle the purchase contracts early  holders of the senior subordinated amortizing notes will have the right to require k 
hovnanian to repurchase such holders senior subordinated amortizing notes  except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing senior subordinated amortizing notes 
unless settled earlier  on february  subject to postponement under certain circumstances  each purchase contract will automatically settle and we will deliver a number of shares of class a common stock based on the applicable market value  as defined in the purchase contract agreement  which will be between shares and shares per purchase contract subject to adjustment 
each teu may be separated into its constituent purchase contract and senior subordinated amortizing note after the initial issuance date of the teus  and the separate components may be combined to create a teu 
the senior subordinated amortizing note component of the teus is recorded as debt  and the purchase contract component of the teus is recorded in equity as additional paid in capital 
we have recorded million  the initial fair value of the purchase contracts  as additional paid in capital 
as of october   million purchase contracts have been converted into million shares of our class a common stock 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we exchanged pursuant to agreements with bondholders approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated amortizing notes for shares of our class a common stock  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these transactions resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended october  the gain is included in the consolidated statement of operations as gain on extinguishment of debt 
on february   k 
hovnanian issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these notes were the subject of a november exchange offer discussed below 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the senior notes due  class a common stock described above  and units were approximately million  a portion of which were used to fund the purchase through tender offers  on february   of the following series of k 
hovnanian s then outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes and  together with the senior notes and the senior subordinated notes  the tender offer notes 
on february   k 
hovnanian called for redemption on march  all tender offer notes that were not tendered in the tender offers for an aggregate redemption price of approximately million 
such redemptions were funded with proceeds from the offerings of the class a common stock  the teus and the senior notes due on may   k 
hovnanian issued an aggregate principal amount of million of additional senior secured notes due resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
on june   we used these net proceeds together with cash on hand  to fund the redemption of the remaining outstanding principal amount million of our senior secured notes due and the remaining outstanding principal amount million of our senior secured notes due these transactions  along with the tender offers and redemptions in february and march discussed above  resulted in a loss of million during the year ended october  the losses from the transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations as loss gain on extinguishment of debt 
on november   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the notes  and together with the notes the notes in exchange for million of certain of our unsecured senior notes with maturities ranging from through holders of the senior notes due and that were exchanged in the exchange offer also received an aggregate of approximately million in cash payments and all holders of senior notes that were exchanged in the exchange offer received accrued and unpaid interest in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
costs associated with this transaction were million 
the notes and the notes were issued as separate series under an indenture  but have substantially the same terms other than with respect to interest rate and related redemption provisions  and vote together as a single class 
due to the then existing financial condition of k 
hovnanian as determined in accordance with asc  accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings and because the holders of the senior notes that exchanged such notes for notes granted k 
hovnanian a concession in the form of extended maturities and reduced interest rates  the accounting for the debt exchange was treated as a troubled debt restructuring 
under this accounting  the company did not recognize any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt and the costs associated with the debt exchange were expensed as incurred as shown in other operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the credit facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants  but does contain certain restrictive covenants that track those contained in our indenture governing the first lien notes  which are described above 
the credit facility also contains certain customary events of default which would permit the administrative agent at the request of the required lenders to  among other things  declare all loans then outstanding to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments of amounts payable under the credit facility or other material indebtedness or the acceleration of other material indebtedness  the failure to comply with agreements and covenants or for representations or warranties to be correct in all material respects when made  specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency  and the entry of a material judgment against a loan party

as of october   there were no borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility and as of such date  we believe we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit facility 
in addition to the credit facility  we have certain stand alone cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities under which there were a total of million and million of letters of credit outstanding as of october  and  respectively 
these agreements and facilities require us to maintain specified amounts of cash as collateral in segregated accounts to support the letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses

total inventory  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  increased million during the year ended october  total inventory  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  increased in the mid atlantic by million  in the midwest million  in the southeast by million and in the southwest by million 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in the northeast of million and in the west of million 
the increases were primarily attributable to new land purchases and land development during fiscal  offset by home deliveries 
the decreases in the northeast and west during fiscal were due to delivering homes at a faster pace than purchasing new land to replenish our inventory 
during fiscal  we incurred million in impairments  primarily in the northeast 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during fiscal related to land options that expired or that we terminated  as the communities forecasted profitability was not projected to produce adequate returns on investment commensurate with the risk 
in the last few years  we have been able to acquire new land parcels at prices that we believe will generate reasonable returns under current homebuilding market conditions 
there can be no assurances that this trend will continue in the near term 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next months 
the total inventory increase discussed above excluded the increase in consolidated inventory not owned of million 
consolidated inventory not owned consists of specific performance options and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the increase from october  to october   was primarily due to sale and leaseback of certain model homes and land banking transactions during fiscal during fiscal and  we sold and leased back certain of our model homes with the right to participate in the potential profit when each home is sold to a third party at the end of the respective lease 
as a result of our continued involvement for accounting purposes in accordance with asc  these sale and leaseback transactions are considered a financing rather than a sale for accounting purposes 
therefore  for purposes of our consolidated balance sheet  at october   inventory of million was recorded to consolidated inventory not owned other options  with a corresponding amount of million recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned 
in addition  we entered into a land banking arrangement in fiscal with gso capital partners lp gso that continued in fiscal whereby we sold a portfolio of our land parcels to gso  and gso provided us an option to purchase back finished lots on a quarterly basis 
because of our option to repurchase these parcels  for accounting purposes in accordance with asc  this transaction is considered a financing rather than a sale 
for purposes of our consolidated balance sheet  at october   inventory of million was recorded to consolidated inventory not owned other options  with a corresponding amount of million recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned for the amount of net cash received from the transactions 
from time to time we enter into option agreements that include specific performance requirements  whereby we are required to purchase a minimum number of lots 
because of our obligation to purchase these lots  for accounting purposes in accordance with asc  we are required to record this inventory on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   we had million of specific performance options recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to consolidated inventory not owned specific performance options  with a corresponding amount recorded to liabilities from inventory not owned 
when possible  we option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option other than with respect to specific performance options discussed above 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
the costs associated with optioned properties are included in land and land options held for future development or sale inventory 
also included in land and land options held for future development or sale inventory are amounts associated with inventory in mothballed communities 
we mothball or stop development on certain communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at the time 
that is  we believe we will generate higher returns if we decide against spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such times as the markets improve or we determine to sell the property 
as of october   we have mothballed land in communities 
the book value associated with these communities at october  was million  net of impairment charges recorded in prior periods of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
during fiscal  we mothballed one community  re activated three previously mothballed communities and sold one mothballed community 
our inventory representing land and land options held for future development or sale at october   on the consolidated balance sheets  increased by million compared to october  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of new land in all segments during fiscal  offset by the movement of certain of our communities from held for future development to sold and unsold homes and lots under development during the period  combined with land sales in the northeast and southwest 
inventories held for sale  which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes  represented million of our total inventories at october   and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining fair value for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies  which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties 
the following tables summarize home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the increase in total home sites available at october  compared to october  is attributable to signing new land option agreements and acquiring new land parcels  offset by terminating certain option agreements and delivering homes

started or completed unsold homes decreased in total  and on a per active selling community basis  from october  to october   primarily due to increased sales pace in many of our homebuilding markets 
model homes decreased in total from october  to october   primarily due to model homes that were sold to a third party in sales lease back transactions during fiscal october  october  unsold homes models total unsold homes models total northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total started or completed unsold homes and models per active selling communities active selling communities which are communities that are open for sale with or more home sites available were and at october  and  respectively 
ratio does not include substantially completed communities  which are communities with less than home sites available 
homebuilding restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at october  compared to october  the decrease was primarily related to the release of cash securitizing letters of credit as we transitioned from having letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreements and facilities that required cash collateral to having letters of credit issued under our new credit facility that does not require any cash collateral 
also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our surety bond escrow cash requirements during fiscal investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  the decrease was primarily due to reduced advances at october  as compared to october  partially offsetting this decrease was an increase related to the investment in two new homebuilding joint ventures during fiscal as of october   we had investments in seven homebuilding joint ventures and one land development joint venture 
we have no guarantees associated with our unconsolidated joint ventures  other than guarantees limited only to performance and completion of development  environmental indemnification and standard warranty and representation against fraud misrepresentation and similar actions  including a voluntary bankruptcy 
receivables  deposits and notes decreased million from october  to million at october  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in receivables for home closings as a result of cash in transit from various title companies at the end of the respective periods 
in addition  although we received reimbursements from our insurance carriers for certain warranty claims  we also increased our allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain other of our insurance receivables and other note receivables 
property  plant and equipment decreased million during the year ended october  primarily due to depreciation and a small amount of disposals  which were offset by minor additions for leasehold improvements during the period 
prepaid expenses and other assets were as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance prepaid project costs net rental properties other prepaids other assets total prepaid insurance increased due to premium payments made on certain liability insurance policies during fiscal these costs are amortized over the life of the associated insurance policy  which can be one to three years 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
net rental properties decreased primarily due to the sale of our last senior residential rental property during the second quarter of fiscal the remaining balance of net rental properties represents leasehold improvements for an office building that we fully sub lease 
other prepaids increased primarily as a result of fees paid in connection with our new credit facility entered into during the third quarter of fiscal  along with prepaid payroll taxes related to the timing of the company s payroll at october  other assets decreased mainly due to the sale of company owned life insurance policies to a third party during fiscal for approximately book value 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of residential mortgages receivable held for sale  of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and are awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale from october  was primarily related to the timing of loans closed during fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal financial services other assets decreased million to million at october  compared to october  the decrease is related to the closing of mortgages in the first quarter of fiscal  which were funded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in anticipation of home closings on the last days of october that did not occur until early november  due to weather related delays from hurricane sandy 
nonrecourse mortgages were million at october  and million at october  the increase was primarily due to new mortgages for communities in the northeast  the mid atlantic  the midwest  the southwest and the west obtained during fiscal  along with increased borrowings on certain of our existing non recourse mortgages 
offsetting the increase was a decrease related to a property in the mid atlantic  which we had previously acquired when our partner in a land development joint venture transferred its interest in the venture to us  that was foreclosed on in fiscal as a result  the non recourse liability of million and corresponding inventory balance were taken off our balance sheet for the second quarter of fiscal also offsetting the increase during the period were principal payments made on certain of our existing non recourse mortgages 
accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable reserves accrued expenses accrued compensation other liabilities total the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the higher volume of deliveries in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  along with a change in the scheduled timing of certain of our monthly payments 
reserves increased during the period as new accruals for general liability insurance exceeded payments for warranty related claims 
the decrease in accrued expenses is primarily due to decreases in property tax accruals and amortization of abandoned lease space accruals 
the increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals as profitability increased in many of our markets  as well as for the consolidated company  in fiscal other liabilities decreased primarily due to installment payments made to a former joint venture partner for the buy out of their share of the joint venture during fiscal customer deposits increased to million at october  from million at october  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in backlog as of october  liabilities from inventory not owned increased million to million at october  from million at october  the increase is primarily due to the model home and land banking programs described above with the change in inventory not owned discussion 
financial services accounts payable and other liabilities decreased million to million at october  the decrease primarily related to the decrease in restricted cash in our title company during the period  due to a decrease in the volume and timing of home closings during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal financial services mortgage warehouse lines of credit decreased million from million at october   to million at october  the decrease correlates to the decrease in the volume of mortgage loans held for sale during the period  along with the decrease in financial services other assets  discussed above 
accrued interest increased million to million at october  as compared to october  this increase is due to the timing of semi annual interest payments on our bonds 
income taxes payable of million at october  decreased million during the year ended october  to million primarily due to the release of reserves for a federal tax position that was settled with the internal revenue service during the first quarter of fiscal  offset by state tax expense

the fluctuations in average prices were a result of the geographic and community mix of our deliveries  as well as price increases in certain of our individual communities 
during fiscal and  we were able to raise prices in a number of our communities

quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by segment  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  for the years ending october   and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total contracts per average active selling community in fiscal were compared to fiscal of our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by the increase in the pace of sales in all of the company s segments  due to improved market conditions and lower interest rates on mortgages during fiscal cancellation rates represent the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of the beginning backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth historically  most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks after the signing of the contract 
cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  beginning in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we started experiencing higher than normal numbers of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations were related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by us and other builders  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria leading to some customers inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases  the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenues 
our cancellations as a percentage of beginning backlog for fiscal were lower than what we believe to be normalized levels for the fourth quarter of our cancellation rate based on gross sales contracts for fiscal was more typical of what we believe to be more normalized levels  except for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased in conjunction with the slowdown in sales during august and september however  in october and november  sales returned to prior year levels 
it is difficult to predict what cancellation rates will be in the future 
an important indicator of our future results is recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  by segment is set forth below dollars in thousands october  october  october  northeast total contract backlog number of homes mid atlantic total contract backlog number of homes midwest total contract backlog number of homes southeast total contract backlog number of homes southwest total contract backlog number of homes west total contract backlog number of homes totals total consolidated contract backlog number of homes our net contracts for the full years of fiscal and  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  increased and increased  respectively  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in the month of november  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  we signed an additional net contracts amounting to million in contract value 
total cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations includes expenses for consolidated housing and land and lot sales  including inventory impairment loss and land option write offs defined as land charges in the tables below 
a breakout of such expenses for housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest expense homebuilding gross margin  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest expense  excluding land sales interest expense homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges land charges homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges gross margin percentage after cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales expenses as a percentage of consolidated home sales revenues are presented below year ended october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales  before interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense and before land charges we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margin percentage  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges  increased to for the year ended october   compared to for the same period last year 
the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the mix of higher margin homes delivered during the year ended october  compared to the prior year 
this mix change is a result of delivering more homes in communities where we acquired the land more recently at lower costs than land acquired before the housing downturn 
in addition  during fiscal and we saw an increase in the pace of sales in some of our markets and  as a result  in a majority of communities we were able to increase base prices and increase lot premiums 
for the years ended october   and  gross margin was favorably impacted by the reversal of prior period inventory impairments of million  million and million  respectively  which represented  and  respectively  of sale of homes revenue 
during fiscal  there was a declining pace of sales in our markets which led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to attempt to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  and lowered some base prices  all of which significantly impacted our margins and resulted in significant inventory impairments 
reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an additional discussion 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs totaling million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total land charges mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned or abandoned  engineering costs are written off 
option  approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s pro forma profitability is not projected to produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and when we believe it is probable we will cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments in fiscal and and all segments except the west in the inventory impairments amounted to million  million  and million for the years ending october   and  respectively 
in fiscal and  inventory impairments were lower than they had been in several years as we began to see some stabilization in the prices and sales pace in some of our segments as reflected by the overall improvement of the housing industry 
in fiscal  the majority of the impairments were in the northeast and west segments 
impairments in the northeast were primarily due to increased weakness in the market  primarily in northern new jersey and communities now classified as held for sale or sold and thus adjusted to fair value 
in the west  where we had significant competition from foreclosures  we had reduced prices in order to maintain sales pace 
this was especially true in some of the more fringe markets in our west segment 
it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue  and should it become necessary to further lower prices  or should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may need to recognize additional impairments 
below is a breakdown of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal in  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that we believe remain economically feasible 
the following table represents lot option walk aways by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of walk away number of walk away lots of walk away lots total option lots walk away lots as a of total option lots northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes lots optioned at october  and lots optioned that the company walked away from in the year ended october  we can incur costs while investigating land options  whereby we decided not to pursue the opportunity before we control the lots 
these costs are expensed in the period we decided to no longer pursue the opportunity 
for the year ended october   such costs were not significant and are therefore not shown in the tables above

land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october  october  october  land and lot sales cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest land and lot sales gross margin  excluding interest land sales interest expense land and lot sales gross margin  including interest land sales are ancillary to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult 
there were land sales in the year ended october   compared to in the same period of the prior year  which resulted in a decrease of million in land sales revenue 
there were land sales in the year ended october   which resulted in an increase of million in land sales revenue in fiscal land sales and other revenues decreased million and increased million for the years ended october  and compared to the same period in the prior year 
other revenues include income from contract cancellations where the deposit has been forfeited due to contract terminations  interest income  cash discounts  buyer walk aways  and miscellaneous one time receipts 
the decrease for the year ended october   compared to the year ended october   was mainly due to the decrease in land sales discussed above  a million decrease in interest income recognized from a note receivable  as well as minor fluctuations spread across the various components of other revenues 
the primary reason for the increase in land sales and other revenues for fiscal was due to the increase in land sales mentioned above  along with a million increase in interest income recognized from a note receivable 
the remaining increase relates to minor fluctuations among the various components of other revenues 
homebuilding selling  general and administrative homebuilding selling  general and administrative sga expenses increased million to million for the year ended october  as compared to the year ended october  this increase was due to higher insurance costs and construction defect reserves and additional reserves for a receivable from an insurance provider and a receivable related to a prior year land sale 
however  these expenses increased by less than the increase in revenues 
therefore  sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved to for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  sga decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  these decreases in sga expenses were the result of reduced costs through administrative consolidation and other cost saving measures

financial services financial services consist primarily of originating mortgages from our home buyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks  federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forward commitments

these expenses include payroll  stock compensation  facility and other costs associated with our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   and declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the increase in expenses for fiscal was due to increased total compensation as a result of a slight increase in headcount  additional amounts accrued for bonuses as a result of improved operating performance  including achieving profitability for fiscal  and additional professional services for various corporate operations 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was due to the decrease in depreciation expense from capitalized software costs becoming fully depreciated coupled with no new significant additions of depreciable assets  and a continued effort to tighten variable spending 
other interest other interest decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to october  for fiscal  other interest increased million to million compared to october  our assets that qualify for interest capitalization inventory under development are less than our debt  and therefore a portion of interest not covered by qualifying assets must be directly expensed 
in fiscal  our interest incurred decreased compared to the prior year due to the lower effective interest rates on our outstanding debt and lower overall balance of our outstanding debt  which resulted in less interest that was required to be directly expensed 
for the and fiscal years  other interest was relatively flat 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior rental residential property operations  rent expense for commercial office space  amortization of prepaid bond fees  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  and corporate owned life insurance 
compared to the previous year  other operations decreased million to million for the year ended october   and decreased million to million for the year ended october  the decrease in expenses from october  compared to october  was due mainly to the million of costs incurred from the debt exchange completed in fiscal discussed above under capital resources and liquidity and also the gain recognized from the sale of one of our senior rental residential properties in  partially offset by the loss of related rental income in fiscal due to the then existing financial condition of k 
hovnanian as determined in accordance with asc and because the holders of the senior notes that exchanged such notes for notes granted k 
hovnanian a concession in the form of extended maturities and reduced interest rates  this debt exchange was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring  which required any costs incurred associated with the exchange to be expensed as incurred 
the decrease in other operations from october  to october  was primarily due to the gain recognized from the sale of one of our senior residential properties partially offset by the cost incurred from the debt exchange on november  previously discussed 
loss gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended october   our loss on extinguishment of debt decreased million to million 
in the fourth quarter of  k 
hovnanian issued an aggregate principal amount of million of its senior notes due the notes were issued as additional senior notes due under the indenture dated as of august  the net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the redemption on october  of all of k 
hovnanian s outstanding senior notes due and senior notes due and to pay related fees and expenses 
these transactions resulted in a write off of prepaid fees and a make whole true up  totaling million 
during the year ended october   our loss on extinguishment of debt was million 
during  we repurchased for cash in the open market and privately negotiated transactions a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
in addition  we exchanged a total of million aggregate principal amount of various issuances of our outstanding senior notes senior and our senior subordinated amortizing notes for class a common stock 
these transactions resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
we also repurchased in a tender offer our senior secured notes due and satisfied and discharged the indenture under which such notes were issued calling the remaining notes for redemption 
we paid a premium  incurred fees and wrote off discounts and prepaid costs that were amortizing over the terms of the senior secured notes  resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
during the year ended october   our gain on extinguishment of debt was million 
in february of  we purchased a portion of our subordinated notes million face for million cash in a tender offer  and redeemed early the remainder of those notes million in debt for million cash 
in both transactions  we paid a premium  incurred fees  and wrote off discounts and prepaid costs that we were amortizing over the term of the notes 
on june   we redeemed early the remainder of certain of our senior secured notes 
these transactions resulted in a loss of million during the year ended october  offsetting this loss was a gain of million on open market repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the net gain of million for the year ended october   is net of the write offs of unamortized discounts and fees  related to these purchases  which represents the difference between the aggregate principal amounts of the notes purchased and the total purchase price 
income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the earnings or losses of the joint ventures 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased million for the year ended october  income was million for the year ended october   compared million for the year ended october  the increase in income was due to certain of our homebuilding joint ventures delivering more homes and reporting increased profits in fiscal in addition  we recognized a higher profit from one of our land development joint ventures during fiscal  which had a larger land sale in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased million to million for the year ended october  compared to a loss of million for the year ended october  the decrease in loss to income was due to five of our homebuilding joint ventures  which reported losses in fiscal  delivering more homes and reporting profits or a decreased loss in fiscal in addition  we recognized profit from one of our land development joint ventures during fiscal  which did not have any activity in the prior year 
total taxes the total income tax benefit of million recognized for the year ended october  was primarily due to the release of reserves for a federal tax position that was settled with the internal revenue service and a favorable state tax audit settlement  partially offset by state tax expenses and state tax reserves for uncertain state tax positions 
the total income tax benefit was million for the year ended october  primarily due to the elimination of reserves for uncertain state tax positions consistent with past practices and precedents of the relevant taxing authorities in their dealings with the company  offset slightly by state tax expenses 
the total income tax benefit was million for the year ended october  primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if the combination of future years income or loss and the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried forward to future years 
in accordance with asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
because of the downturn in the homebuilding industry  resulting in significant inventory and intangible impairments in prior years  we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of october  according to asc  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
our valuation allowance for deferred taxes amounted to million and million at october  and october   respectively 
the valuation allowance decreased during the year ended october  primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax assets as a result of generating a profit before income taxes for fiscal off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  there were no specific performance option contracts as of october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total total contractual obligations exclude our accrual for uncertain tax positions of million recorded for financial reporting purposes as of october  because we were unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
represents our senior secured  senior  senior amortizing  senior exchangeable and senior subordinated amortizing notes  and other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of such debt of million 
does not include the mortgage warehouse lines of credit made under our master repurchase agreements 
see capital resources and liquidity 
also does not include our million revolving credit facility because there were no borrowings outstanding there were issued million of letters of credit under such facility as of october  we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october   related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing us is interest rate risk on our long term debt  including debt instruments at variable interest rates 
in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale  and the associated mortgage warehouse lines of credit under our master repurchase agreements are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly  the interest rate risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk except with respect to mortgage loans 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but we do not believe this risk is material
