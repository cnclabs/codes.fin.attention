item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a global leader in high performance  high efficiency server technology and green computing innovation 
we develop and provide advanced server building block solutions to data center  cloud computing  enterprise  hadoop big data  hpc and embedded markets 
our solutions range from complete server  storage  blade  workstation  and full rack solutions to networking devices and server management software  which can be used by distributors  oems and end customers 
for fiscal years  and  net sales of optimized servers were million  million and million  respectively  and net sales of subsystems and accessories were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in our net sales in fiscal year compared with fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales in subsystems and accessories and server systems with intel sandy bridge processors including twin  storage  microcloud  gpu and blade server solutions 
fiscal year was a challenging year in terms of soft it spending challenging component pricing for hard disk drive and memory and continued economic weakness in europe 
however  we performed strongly and outperformed the industry and our competition 
in addition  our taiwan facility during its first full year of operation helped our asia region revenue grow 
we commenced operations in and have been profitable every year since inception 
for fiscal years  and  our net sales were  million   million and million  respectively  and our net income was million  million and million  respectively 
our decrease in net income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in our gross profit resulting primarily from higher sales of subsystems and accessories which contain higher content of lower margin hard disk drives and memory and higher research and development expenses partially offset by a tax benefit of million related to the us federal r d tax credit  of which million related to fiscal year and the recognition of million benefit related to our resolution during the three months ended march  of irs audits for all outstanding items covering fiscal year through we sell our server systems and subsystems and accessories primarily through distributors and to a lesser extent to oems as well as through our direct sales force 
for fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors  and sold the remaining net sales to oems and end customers 
none of our customers accounted for or more of our net sales in fiscal years  and for fiscal years  and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers in the united states 
we perform the majority of our research and development efforts in house 
for fiscal years  and  research and development expenses represented  and of our net sales  respectively 
our increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was primarily attributable to our increase in headcount and prototype material expenses relating to new product introductions  particularly related to the introduction of new products for technology launches such as intel sandy bridge and haswell processor as well as our fattwin solutions and product development expenses for ivy bridge processor as we drove innovation in our product portfolio to increase performance in density and power 
our increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was primarily attributable to our increased expenses relating to new product introductions  particularly related to the introduction of intel sandy bridge processor as well as net sales which were lower than we had anticipated in fiscal year we use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture components in accordance with our specifications  with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facility in san jose  california 
during fiscal year  we continued to invest in expanding our operations both in san jose  california and our subsidiaries in taiwan and the netherlands in order to support our growth 
we have increased manufacturing and service operations in taiwan and the netherlands to support our asia and european customers and we have increased our utilization of our overseas manufacturing 
table of contents capacity in fiscal year one of our key suppliers is ablecom  a related party  which supplies us with contract design and manufacturing support 
for fiscal years  and  our purchases from ablecom represented  and of our cost of sales  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of cost of sales in fiscal year was attributable to our increased purchases from other suppliers 
ablecom s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of ablecom s net sales 
we continue to maintain our manufacturing relationship with ablecom in asia in an effort to reduce our product costs 
in addition to providing a larger volume of contract manufacturing services for us  ablecom continues to warehouse for us a number of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the united states and europe 
we typically negotiate the price of products that we purchase from ablecom on a quarterly basis  however  either party may re negotiate the price of products with each order 
as a result of our relationship with ablecom  it is possible that ablecom may in the future sell products to us at a price higher or lower than we could obtain from an unrelated third party supplier 
this may result in our future reporting of gross profit as a percentage of net sales that is less than or in excess of what we might have obtained absent our relationship with ablecom 
in order to continue to increase our net sales and profits  we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and customizable server solutions and be among the first to market with new features and products 
we measure our financial success based on various indicators  including growth in net sales  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  operating income as a percentage of net sales  levels of inventory  and days sales outstanding  or dsos 
in connection with these efforts  we monitor daily and weekly sales and shipment reports 
among the key non financial indicators of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application optimized server solutions 
in this regard  we work closely with microprocessor and other component vendors to take advantage of new technologies as they are introduced 
historically  our ability to introduce new products rapidly has allowed us to benefit from the introduction of new microprocessors and as a result we monitor the introduction cycles of intel  amd and nvidia carefully 
this also impacts our research and development expenditures 
for example  in fiscal year and in prior years  our results have been adversely impacted by customer order delays in anticipation of the introduction of the new lines of microprocessors and research and development expenditures necessary for us to prepare for the introduction 
other financial highlights the following is a summary of other financial highlights of fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were million at the end of fiscal year  compared with million at the end of fiscal year the increase in our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments at the end of fiscal year was primarily due to million of cash generated from our operating activities and million of borrowings  net of repayments  offset in part by million of purchases of property and equipments 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso at the end of fiscal year was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal year the increase in our dso was primarily due to an increase in sales to customers with net payment terms and a decrease in sales to customers with telegraphic transfer tt payment terms 
our inventory balance was million at the end of fiscal year  compared with million at the end of fiscal year days sales of inventory dsi at the end of fiscal year was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal year the decrease in our inventory balance at the end of fiscal year was in part due to a decrease in hard disk drives and memory as supply for hard disk drives have become more stable since the end of fiscal year our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year included in the above non cancellable commitments are hard disk drive purchase commitments totaling approximately million  which have terms expiring through december see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a discussion of purchase commitments 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal year  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents revenues and expenses net sales 
net sales consist of sales of our server solutions  including server systems  subsystems and accessories 
the main factors which impact our net sales are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
the prices for server systems range widely depending upon the configuration  and the prices for our subsystems and accessories vary based on the type 
as with most electronics based products  average selling prices typically are highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products  including the costs of materials  contract manufacturing  shipping  personnel and related expenses  equipment and facility expenses  warranty costs and inventory excess and obsolete provisions 
the primary factors that impact our cost of sales are the mix of products sold and cost of materials  which include raw material costs  shipping costs and salary and benefits related to production 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our costs 
our cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  is generally lower on server systems than on subsystems and accessories 
because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  our cost of sales is subject to change based on market conditions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of the personnel and related expenses of our research and development teams  and materials and supplies  consulting services  third party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we occasionally receive non recurring engineering  or nre funding from certain suppliers and customers 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain research and development costs that we incur as part of the joint development of our products and those of our suppliers and customers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related research and development expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and incentive bonuses for our sales and marketing personnel  costs for tradeshows  independent sales representative fees and marketing programs 
from time to time  we receive cooperative marketing funding from certain suppliers 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses 
similarly  we from time to time offer our distributors cooperative marketing funding which has the effect of increasing our expenses 
the timing  magnitude and estimated usage of our programs and those of our suppliers can result in significant variations in reported sales and marketing expenses from period to period 
spending on cooperative marketing  either by us or our suppliers  typically increases in connection with significant product releases by us or our suppliers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs  including personnel expenses  financial reporting  corporate governance and compliance and outside legal  audit and tax fees 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net represents the net of our interest income on investments or interest expense on the building loans or line of credit for our owned facilities offset by interest earned on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate  currently primarily the united states  the netherlands and taiwan and to a lesser extent  china 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits and the domestic production activities deduction and lower taxes in foreign jurisdictions which were partially offset by the impact of state taxes and stock option expenses 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  cooperative marketing accruals  investment valuations  inventory valuations  income taxes  warranty obligations and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the 
table of contents judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our more significant judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of products  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred and title has transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and all significant obligations have been met 
generally this occurs at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  to days payment terms  ex works terms  except for a few customers who have free on board destination terms or customer acceptance provisions  for which revenue is recognized when the products arrive or are accepted at the destination 
we generally do not provide for non warranty rights of return except for products which have out of box failure  where customers could return these products for credit within days of receiving the items 
certain distributors and oems are also permitted to return products in unopened boxes  limited to purchases over a specified period of time  generally within to days of the purchase  or to products in the distributor s or oem s inventory at certain times such as the termination of the agreement or product obsolescence 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate regularly with our distributors to gather information about end customer satisfaction  and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
reserves for future returns are adjusted as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and communication with our distributors 
in addition  certain customers have acceptance provisions and revenue is deferred until the customers provide the necessary acceptance 
at june  and  we had deferred revenue of million and million and related deferred product costs of million and million  respectively  related to shipments to customers pending acceptances 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon the review process  the customers are required to pay cash in advance of shipment 
we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables  analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
we provide for price protection to certain distributors 
we assess the market competition and product technology obsolescence  and make price adjustments based on our judgment 
upon each announcement of price reductions  the accrual for price protection is calculated based on our distributors inventory on hand 
such reserves are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time we reduce the product prices 
we have an immaterial amount of service revenue relating to non warranty repairs  which is recognized upon shipment of the repaired units to customers 
service revenue has been less than of net sales for all periods presented and is not separately disclosed 
product warranties 
we offer product warranties ranging from to months against any defective product 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical warranty experience and recent trends 
we monitor warranty obligations and may make revisions to our warranty reserve if actual costs of product repair and replacement are significantly higher or lower than estimated 
accruals for anticipated future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales and included in accrued liabilities 
the liability for product warranties was million as of june   compared with million as of june  the provision for warranty reserve was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our estimates and assumptions used have been historically close to actual 
the change in estimated liability for pre existing warranties was  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result of our increase in cost of servicing warranty claims from our increase in net sales in fiscal year  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year as we experienced an increase in warranty claims and cost of servicing warranty claims from our increase in net sales in fiscal year  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year if in future periods  we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  we intend to adjust our estimates appropriately 

table of contents inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for lower of cost or market and excess and obsolescence and  as necessary  write down the valuation of units to lower of cost or market or for excess and obsolescence based upon the number of units that are unlikely to be sold based upon estimated demand for the following twelve months 
this evaluation takes into account matters including expected demand  anticipated sales price  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write down  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
we monitor the extent to which previously written down inventory is sold at amounts greater or less than carrying value  and based on this analysis  adjust our estimate for determining future write downs 
if in future periods  we experience or anticipate a change in recovery rate compared with our historical experience  our gross margin would be affected 
our provision for inventory was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit and new exposures 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
we measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and non employee members of the board of directors including employee stock options and restricted stock awards based on estimated fair values 
we are required to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant 
the value of awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods 
compensation expense for options and restricted stock awards granted to employees was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   the total unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unvested stock options granted since july  to employees and non employee members of the board of directors  was million  which is expected to be recognized as an expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using a black scholes option pricing model and a single option award approach 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected forfeiture rate 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on an analysis of the relevant peer companies post vest termination rates and exercise behavior for the stock options granted prior to june  for stock options and restricted stock awards granted after june   expected term is based on a combination of our peer group and our historical experience 
the expected volatility is based on a combination of the implied and historical volatility of our relevant peer group for the stock options granted prior to september  for stock options and restricted stock awards granted after september   expected volatility is based solely on our historical volatility 
in addition  forfeitures of share based awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
variable interest entities 
we have concluded that ablecom and its subsidiaries ablecom is a variable interest entity in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of 
table of contents ablecom and therefore  we do not consolidate ablecom 
in performing our analysis  we considered our explicit arrangements with ablecom including the supplier and distributor arrangements 
also  as a result of the substantial related party relationship between the two companies  we considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause us to protect those related parties interests in ablecom from suffering losses 
we determined that no implicit arrangements exist with ablecom or its shareholders 
such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duty that we have towards our stockholders who do not own shares in ablecom 
in may  we and ablecom jointly established super micro business park  inc management company in taiwan to manage the common areas shared by us and ablecom for our separately constructed manufacturing facilities 
each company contributed  and own of the management company 
although the operations of the management company are independent of us  through governance rights  we have the ability to direct the management company business strategies 
therefore  we have concluded that the management company is a variable interest entity of us as we are the primary beneficiary of the management company 
as of june   the accounts of the management company have been consolidated with our accounts  and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for ablecom interests in the net assets and operations of the management company 
in fiscal year   of net income attributable to ablecom interest was included in our general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth our financial results  as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interest expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million from  million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in unit volumes of our subsystems and accessories and to a lesser extent an increase in the average selling price of our server systems offset by a decrease in unit volumes of server systems as we sold more higher density server systems on a processing node basis in fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  the number of server system units sold decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year the average selling price of server system units increased to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the average selling prices of our server systems increased primarily due to higher average selling prices of microcloud  fattwin servers  storage and superblades servers with intel sandy bridge processors which offered higher density computing and more memory and hard disk drive capacity 
sales of server systems increased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales of twin  storage  microcloud  gpu xeon phi and superblade servers solutions and complete integrated high end servers solutions to oem and end customers partially offset by lower sales of rack solutions 
sales of server systems represented of our net sales for fiscal year compared to of our net sales for fiscal year 
table of contents for fiscal year  the number of subsystems and accessories units sold increased to million compared to million for fiscal year sales of subsystems and accessories increased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily related to higher sales of hard disk drives  chassis  memory and serverboards to our distributors and system integrators who purchased additional accessories from us and completed the final assembly themselves 
sales of subsystems and accessories represented of our net sales for fiscal year as compared to of our net sales for fiscal year for fiscal year and  we derived and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors and we derived and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers

cost of sales increased by million  or  to  million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  an increase of million in provision for warranty reserve and an increase of million in provision for inventory reserve 
the higher cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher costs of hard disk drives as a result of our hdd supply agreement and memory bundled with our server solutions and higher mix of subsystem and accessories sales 
in general  we have higher margins in server systems than in subsystems and accessories 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the provision for warranty reserve as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for warranty reserve was primarily due to higher cost of servicing warranty claims from higher net sales in fiscal year if in future periods we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  our gross margin would be affected 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  net of recovery  or of net sales  related to the inventory provision as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the inventory provision was primarily for older products as a result of product transitions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
research and development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits including higher stock based compensation expense  resulting from growth in research and development personnel related to expanded product development initiatives in the united states and in taiwan  a decrease of million in non recurring engineering funding from certain suppliers and customers and an increase of million in vat expenses related to research and development service fees paid to our subsidiary in taiwan 
the increase as a percentage of sales was due to increased headcount and prototype material expenses relating to new product introductions  particularly related to the introduction of new products for technology launches such as intel sandy bridge and haswell processor as well as our fattwin solutions and product development expenses for ivy bridge processor as we drove innovation in our product portfolio to increase performance in density and power

sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits resulting from growth in sales and marketing personnel  including higher stock based compensation expense and an increase of million in advertising  promotional and trade show expenses offset in part by an increase of million in cooperative marketing funding received from vendors to promote the new product launches and a decrease of million in cooperative marketing funding to our customers 
sales and marketing expenses include stock based compensation expense of million for both fiscal year and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including higher stock based compensation expense  in part to support 
table of contents the expansion of our operations at our headquarters and operations in taiwan  an increase of million in bad debt expense  an increase of million in payroll tax audit reserve  a decrease of million in rental income  an increase of million in miscellaneous expense relating to the settlement payment of one patent claim offset in part by a decrease of million in foreign currency transaction loss  a decrease of million in moving expenses and a decrease of million in legal fees

provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for fiscal year and  respectively 
the lower provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for fiscal year were primarily attributable to our lower net income  a tax benefit of million related to the us federal r d tax credit  of which million related to fiscal year  and the recognition of a million benefit related to our resolution of irs audits for all outstanding items covering fiscal year through  offset in part by an increase of million in stock option expense 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average selling price of our server systems and an increase in unit volumes of our server systems 
for fiscal year  the number of server system units sold increased to  compared to  for fiscal year the average selling price of server system units increased to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the average selling prices of our server systems increased primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of hard disk drives caused by the flooding in thailand  higher average selling prices of complete integrated high end server solutions to oem and end customers  rack solutions and superblades offset in part by declines in average selling prices of series configuration of servers 
sales of server systems increased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales of complete integrated high end server solutions to oem and end customers and higher sales of rack  storage and superblades server solutions 
sales of server systems represented of our net sales for fiscal year compared to of our net sales for fiscal year for fiscal year  the number of subsystems and accessories units sold decreased to million compared to million for fiscal year sales of subsystems and accessories decreased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily related to lower sales of subsystems and accessories  such as memory and serverboards as a result of the flooding in thailand and the effects on hard disk drive supply chain which prevented our system integrators from purchasing memory and serverboards and completing the final assembly of server solutions 
sales of subsystems and accessories represented of our net sales for fiscal year as compared to of our net sales for fiscal year for fiscal year and  we derived and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors and we derived and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers

cost of sales increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal year and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  an increase of million in provision for warranty reserve  an increase of million in provision for inventory reserve and an increase of million in freight in charges 
the lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales of server solutions which typically have higher margins 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the provision for warranty reserve as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for warranty reserve was primarily due to higher warranty claims and higher cost of servicing warranty claims in fiscal year if in future periods we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  our gross margin would be affected

this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
we have adopted the provisions of this standard on a retrospective basis 
this adoption did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position  but resulted in the presentation of a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance associated with reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires companies to present significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety in the statement of operations or in a separate footnote to the financial statements

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
our long term investments include auction rate securities  which have been classified as long term due to the lack of a liquid market for these securities 
since our results of operations are not dependent on investments  the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as of june   our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposits and auction rate securities see liquidity risk below 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our term loan and revolving lines of credit 
the interest rates for the term loans and the revolving lines of credit ranged from to at june  and to at june   respectively 
based on the outstanding principal indebtedness of million under our credit facilities as of june   we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
liquidity risk as of june   we held million of auction rate securities  net of unrealized losses  representing our interest in auction rate preferred shares in a closed end mutual fund invested in municipal securities  the auction rate security was rated aaa or aa at june  these auction rate preferred shares have no stated maturity date 
during february  the auctions for these auction rate securities began to fail to obtain sufficient bids to establish a clearing rate and were not saleable in the auction  thereby losing the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction process 
as a result  as of june   million of these auction rate securities have been classified as long term available for sale investments 
based on our assessment of fair value at june   we have recorded an accumulated unrealized loss of million  net of deferred income taxes  on long term auction rate securities 
the unrealized loss was deemed to be temporary and has been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during fiscal year  and  million  million and million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par  respectively 
although we have determined that we will not likely be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery and we have the intent and ability to hold our investments until successful auctions occur  these investments are not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
there can be no assurances that these investments will be settled in the short term or that they will not become other than temporarily impaired subsequent to june   as the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
in any event  we do not have a present need to access these funds for operational purposes 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments as there is no assurance as to when the market for these investments will allow us to liquidate them 
we may be required to record impairment charges in periods subsequent to june  which respect to these securities and  if a liquid market does not develop for these investments  we could be required to hold them to market recovery 
foreign currency risk to date  our international customer and supplier agreements have been denominated primarily in us dollars  and accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from customer agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  the functional currency of our operations in netherlands and taiwan is the us dollar and our local accounts including financing arrangements are denominated in the local currency in the netherlands and taiwan  respectively  and thus we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with re measurement to us dollars 
such fluctuations have not been significant historically 
foreign exchange gain loss for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively
