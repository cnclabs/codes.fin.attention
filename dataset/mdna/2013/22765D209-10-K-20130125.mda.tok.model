overview the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
product focus we are a global provider of data protection solutions and services 
through the innovative use of new technologies  we deliver customer driven solutions that enable proactive data protection  advanced data archival  optimized performance and significant cost savings over current solutions 
in fiscal year  we introduced our crossroads strongbox product  a network attached storage nas solution based on tape for long term archive data 
we believe strongbox is the first fully portable  open standard  online all the time data storage vault that meets the cost  life expectancy and scalability requirements for companies needing to solve their long term data repository needs

in particular  the factors discussed below and in item a  risk factors  could affect our actual results and cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
we deliver our current offerings to the market through hardware appliances 
this strategy allows us to use off the shelf hardware platforms  which can easily be customized to support specific oem or si specifications 
we believe this strategy provides us with low cost  high performance options that can be quickly deployed with minimal disruption to customers while minimizing inventory and associated excess and obsolete costs 
substantially all of our current products have been sold in combination with support and services contracts 
our support and services contracts are typically offered for periods of one to three years 
we mainly sell these products through a network of oems  sis and vars 
ip licensing campaign focus we continue to realize revenue from existing intellectual property  or ip  licensees with go forward royalties derived from the patent family  which accounts for of our existing granted patents and pending patents as of october  we maintain an active licensing program related to the family  which has been licensed to over of the leading storage industry providers 
we pursue licensing fees for past shipments and recurring licensing fees related to ongoing shipments 
in some cases we are required to litigate where we believe other companies are infringing our patents 
generally  these cases are settled quickly as we engage in business discussions with the opposing parties  however  one or more of the litigants may pursue their defense to greater lengths  which would require higher expenses to continue the lawsuit 
our ip licensing revenue for the year ended october  was million  or approximately of revenues 
we continue to look for different ways to extract value from our patents outside the family  which may include commercial  financial and strategic initiatives 
ip holds value beyond pure monetary reasons 
for example  we believe that the proprietary nature of our products is appealing to both end users and strategic partners who view our products as not being easily replaceable 
additionally  ip may be a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors 
therefore  we will continue to assess the value of our current portfolio and attempt to expand and take advantage of our ip portfolio 
key financial definitions revenue 
revenue consists of sales of hardware  software and services  as well as royalties we earn for products and the license of certain intellectual property 
our product revenue is composed of sales of our hardware products and software products sold to value added resellers  original equipment manufacturers and end users 
our ip license  royalty and other revenue is derived from the licensing of intellectual property  royalty payments  and sales of service contracts 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is composed of cost of product revenue and ip license  royalty and other revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost charged by our previous contract manufacturer to manufacture our products  shipping charges and warranty obligations 
cost of ip license  royalty and other revenue consists of professional fees and services  overhead allocations  and obsolete inventory adjustments 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets 
personnel related costs  which include stock based compensation expense  are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we had employees as of october   employees as of october  and employees as of october  we expect our headcount will remain fairly consistent during fiscal year in any particular period  the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  employee sales commissions and marketing programs 
we have sales and marketing personnel throughout the united states and in our sales office in germany 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs  depreciation on lab equipment  costs of prototype equipment  other related costs of quality assurance and overhead allocations 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
though we incur software development costs  the costs of software development that we incur after a product has reached marketability are considered immaterial  and to date  we have not capitalized any such costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  and fees for professional services 
professional services  excluding those for ip which are included in cost of revenue  consists of outside legal  tax and audit costs 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of purchased technology 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments about future uncertainties that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our critical accounting estimates require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are described below 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain when the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition application of the various accounting principles related to measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates in the following related areas determining fair value in arrangements with multiple deliverables  the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements in software arrangements using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  the interpretation of non standard terms and conditions in sales agreements  and assessments of future price adjustments  such as future product returns and estimates for contractual licensee fees 
additionally  we sometimes use judgment in determining whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements in order to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
for established products and pcs  we determine fair value based on vsoe  which consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately 
for arrangements with multiple elements entered into prior to november   we allocate revenue to the separate elements based on relative fair value  provided the fair value for all elements of the arrangement are known 
if  in an arrangement  the undelivered elements have fair value  but the delivered element does not  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if fair value does not exist for undelivered elements  then revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
while the majority of our sales arrangements contain standard terms and conditions  we sometimes apply judgment when interpreting complex arrangements with non standard terms and conditions to determine the appropriate accounting 
an example of such a judgment is deferring revenue related to significant post delivery obligations and customer acceptance criteria until such obligations are fulfilled 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated future product returns 
these allowances are based on programs in existence at the time revenue is recognized 
we have historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required and recognize revenue  net of these projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
if allowances cannot be reliably estimated in any specific reporting period  revenue would be deferred until the rights have lapsed and we are no longer under obligation to reduce the price or accept the return of the product 
we license our patented technology to customers under licensing agreements that allow those customers to utilize our technology in specific products they offer 
as consideration  licensees pay us a fee based on the amount of sales of their products that incorporate our patented technology 
on a periodic and timely basis  the licensees provide us with reports listing their sales to end users for which they owe us license fees 
similarly  royalty revenue is estimated from licensee reports of units sold to end users subject to royalties under master contracts 
in both cases  these reports are used to substantiate delivery and we recognize revenue based on the information in these reports 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis for new or materially modified revenue arrangements as of november  for arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning november   when elements such as hardware  software and services are contained in a single arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on relative selling price using a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or our best estimate of selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
for established products  we use vsoe 
for new products  installation and professional services for which we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if these items were sold on a standalone basis 
in determining esp  we use the cost to provide the new product  installation or professional service plus a margin 
when using cost plus a margin  we consider the total cost of the item to establish a var or oem price 
we also consider the historical margins for established products and other factors  including any changes to pricing methodologies  competitiveness of new products  installation and professional services  pricing pressures due to entering a new market  and cost drivers that could cause future margins to differ from historical margins 
contracts to modify or customize products during the year ended october   we entered into contracts with certain customers to significantly modify or customize products 
in accounting for such arrangements  we first look to the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  software revenue recognition asc  and then asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to determine the appropriate accounting elements in the arrangement 
we then consider the appropriate recognition model for each accounting element based on the nature of the element and apply the guidance in asc subtopic  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts  asc subtopic  asc subtopic  revenue recognition products  or asc subtopic  revenue recognition services  as applicable 
amounts allocated to the modification customization service element are evaluated for classification in the consolidated statement of operations as either revenue or reduction of research and development expense based on the following considerations whether and in what circumstances the consideration received is refundable  ownership of the final product and intellectual property rights to develop the product  and exclusivity of the final product 
we recorded approximately and  as revenue and approximately and  as a reduction of research and development expense related to these contracts for the years ended october  and  respectively 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using standard cost  which approximates the first in  first out method 
adjustments to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value are made for estimated excess  obsolete or impaired balances 
these adjustments are measured as the excess of the cost of the inventory over its market value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to cost of revenue 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of the original cost basis or increases in the newly established cost basis 
impairment of long lived assets we apply judgment when reviewing amortizable intangible and other long lived assets long lived assets for impairment 
we apply judgment when evaluating potential impairment indicators 
indicators we consider include adverse changes in the business climate that could affect the value of our long lived assets  changed long term economic outlook including downward revisions in our revenue projections  negative current events  decreases or slower than expected growth in sales of products and relative weakness in customer channels 
when an impairment indicator exists  we then evaluate long lived assets for impairment as appropriate 
because we operate as a single reporting unit  we consider the company as a whole when evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
if our business operations were to change and revenue streams related to long lived assets were to become identifiable at a lower level  we would apply significant judgment to determine the appropriate grouping of these assets for impairment testing 
we use an undiscounted cash flow approach to evaluate our long lived assets for recoverability when there are impairment indicators 
estimates of future cash flows require significant judgments about the future and include company forecasts and our expectations of future use of our long lived assets  both of which may be impacted by market conditions 
other critical estimates include determining the asset group or groups within our long lived assets  the primary asset of an asset group and the primary asset s useful life 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections for the income approach used in an impairment test are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth  cost of capital and income tax rates 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  applicable interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of our control 
future period results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  which could materially affect the determination of fair value of the company and future amounts of potential impairment 
warranty we estimate future product failure rates based upon historical product failure trends as well as anticipated future failure rates if believed to be significantly different from historical trends 
similarly  we estimate future costs of repair based upon historical trends and anticipated future costs if they are expected to significantly differ  for example due to negotiated agreements with third parties 
we use a consistent model and exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
our model requires an element of subjectivity for all of our products 
for example  historical return rates are not completely indicative of future return rates and we must therefore exercise judgment with respect to future deviations from our historical return rates 
when actual failure rates differ significantly from our estimates  we record the impact of these unforeseen costs or cost reductions in subsequent periods and update our assumptions and forecasting models accordingly 
as our newer products mature  we are able to improve our estimates with respect to these products 
we warrant products for a period from to months following the sale while receiving a hardware warranty from our vendors for a period of typically months 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in addition  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a number of estimates and judgments are necessary to determine deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances 
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities requires judgment related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets due to our history of net losses  difficulty in predicting future results and our conclusion that we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have provided a full valuation allowance against certain of our international net deferred tax assets 
due to reorganizations in these jurisdictions  it is unclear whether we will be able to realize a benefit from these deferred tax assets 
also  certain changes in stock ownership could result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers that can be utilized each year 
should we undergo such a change in stock ownership  it would severely limit the usage of these carryover tax attributes against future income  resulting in additional tax charges 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
future income tax expense will be reduced to the extent that we have sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal or decrease in this allowance 
we also have deferred tax assets and liabilities due to prior business acquisitions with corresponding valuation allowances after assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from these acquired net deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of the applicable guidance under asc topic for share based payment transactions 
under the provision of this guidance  stock based compensation costs for employees is measured on the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award on that date  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period  which is generally over the vesting period  on a straight line basis 
we adopted this guidance using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  non vested option awards outstanding at january   continue to be accounted for under the minimum value method  and all awards granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption are accounted for using the measurement  recognition and attribution provisions of this guidance 
under the provisions of this guidance  we make a number of estimates and assumptions 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
in valuing stock based awards under this guidance  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their stock based awards prior to exercising 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of crossroads stock 
the expected term represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding 
prior to our filing our registration statement on form s on september   shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of our options were restricted for one year from the date of exercise  we therefore we do not believe the actual history of options exercised is an accurate method of calculating the expected term and use the simplified method to derive an expected term 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the variables used in the black scholes calculation are listed below for the respective periods years ended october  expected dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected term years results of operations year ended october  compared to the year ended october  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  product revenues for the year ended october  increased million  or  to million compared with million for the year ended october  due to an increase in strongbox revenue of million  a new product introduced in fiscal year  and an increase in rva revenue of million due to greater activity of oem sales partially offset by a decrease in router product revenue of million for the year ended october  ip license  royalty and other revenue consists of the following for the years ended october  and years ended october  in thousands ip license revenue   hp royalty and pcs service revenue   pcs and other service revenue non hp  ip license  royalty and other revenue   ip license  royalty and other revenues for the year ended october  decreased million  or  to million compared with million for the year ended october  ip license revenue decreased million as a result of three ip agreements being entered into during the year ended october   while two agreements were entered into during the year ended october  hp royalty and pcs service revenue was relatively consistent at million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  pcs and other service revenue non hp increased million due to revenue recognized from our research and development services agreement with iron mountain of approximately million  an increase in the number of customers covered by pcs contracts and an increase in pcs contract rates due to our newer product offerings 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million  or  to million  for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  cost of revenue includes two components  product costs and costs for ip license  royalty and other 
product costs for the year ended october  increased million  or  to  compared with  for the year ended october  as a result of increased product revenue 
ip license  royalty and other costs for the years ended october  and october  was consistent at million  reducing the margin on ip royalty revenue  royalty and other  due to million of revenue related to iron mountain  which has a lower gross margin percentage 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  this increase was mainly due to increases in payroll and benefits of million  and the associated recruiting and relocation expense increases of million 
tradeshow  travel  and travel related expenses also increased by million in fiscal year sales and marketing headcount has increased from to employees  or during the fiscal year ended october  we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  as we continue to market our new strongbox product 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  this increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits of million  and engineering equipment depreciation increases of million  offset by professional expense declines of million  and consulting and outside services declines of million 
additionally  the increase was offset by an increase in customer reimbursed expenses of million 
research and development headcount has increased from to employees  or during the fiscal year ended october  we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to fluctuate during fiscal year due to the iron mountain research and development services agreement 
the increase in absolute dollars in the current year was a result of expanding our engineering department in connection with the development of features associated with the strongbox product 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits of million  and professional fees of million  offset by a decrease in communication services of million and consulting and outside services of million 
general and administrative headcount has increased from to  or during the fiscal year ended october  this headcount increase was mainly associated with bringing the information technology it function in house in fiscal year we had outsourced this function in prior years 
we expect the absolute amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we plan to increase headcount in administration to handle increased corporate activity 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  the decrease was due to containing a full year of amortization of purchased technology that was fully amortized in the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources cash flows our principal liquidity requirements are to meet our lease obligations and our working capital and capital expenditure needs  as we continue to introduce strongbox into the marketplace 
subject to our operating performance  which  if significantly adversely affected  would adversely affect the availability of funds  we expect to finance our operations through cash provided by operations and customer reimbursed expenses  proceeds from the sale of our common stock  and funds available under our credit agreements 
we cannot be sure  however  that this will be the case  and we may seek additional financing in the future 
the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented years ended october  in thousands net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in provided by investing activities  net cash provided by financing activities  net decrease in cash and cash equivalents  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  end of period net cash used in operating activities increased from approximately million in the year ended october  to approximately million in the year ended october  primarily due to increased losses for the year ended october  losses increased due to the increased spending in research and development  as well as sales and marketing  while revenue decreased 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities was also a result of less cash provided by accounts receivable during the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  due to fluctuations in cash receipts from ip license agreements and unfavorable changes in accounts payable timing during the year ended october  compared to prior year  offset by an increase in deferred revenue due to cash received to complete development contracts for strategic partners  and an increase in accrued expenses due to an increase in accrued payroll liabilities during the year ended october  a significant component of cash provided by operating activities is payments received from our ip license agreements 
the economic nature of these agreements is such that they are not consistent in terms of cash receipts 
the agreements include an initial receipt of cash upon reaching agreement  as consideration for royalties on past shipments 
the amounts for past shipments reflected in historical financial statements have fluctuated from period to period and  to the extent that the number of new customers resulting from our licensing campaign decreases  historical results may not be indicative of future receipts 
we may not be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the near term as we continue to invest in and market strongbox 
cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our employees  our capital needs in our research and development efforts  and the purchase of investments with available cash  offset by maturities of our short term investments 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in the year ended october  compared to a use of million in cash during the year ended october  included in the year ended october  are maturities of short term investments of million net of purchases  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
in the year ended october   purchases of million of short term investments net of maturities  and purchase of property and equipment of million accounted for the use of cash 
cash flows provided by financing activities in the year ended october  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities in the year ended october  of million  primarily from the sale of stock to iron mountain for million  option and warrant exercises of million  and million drawn  net of principal repayments  on our term loan during the year ended october  we amended and restated our loan and security agreement with a bank  executed on january  we are required to pay a facility fee of  on the effective date of the amended and restated agreement 
under the agreement  during any time during which our net cash is greater than million  referred to as a streamline period  the bank will make advances not exceeding the lesser of million or the amount available under the borrowing base minus the outstanding principal balance of any advances 
the borrowing base is the sum of of eligible accounts determined by the bank under the agreement  which may be increased by million if our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities exceeds million 
the bank may decrease the percentage in its good faith business judgment based on events  conditions  contingencies or risks which it determines may adversely affect collateral 
during any non streamline period  we may request that the bank finance specific eligible accounts by extending credit to us in an amount equal to the previously described limitations multiplied by the face amount of the eligible account  which becomes a financed receivable under the agreement 
outstanding advances accrue interest during any streamline period at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate determined under the agreement plus  and during any non streamline period  a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus 
in addition  financed receivables under the agreement are subject to additional finance charges equal to the applicable rate of interest for each day it is outstanding multiplied by the outstanding gross face amount of the financed receivable 
the agreement will terminate and all obligations with respect to advances outstanding under the agreement will be due and payable in full on december  prior to the amending and restating of the agreement  it had provided for a term loan in the amount of million  which is no longer available under the agreement 
as of january   there was approximately million outstanding under the term loan  which will continue to accrue interest at a per annum rate of 
we have agreed to repay the term loan in monthly payments of principal and interest in an amount equal to  and all accrued and unpaid interest on the term loan will be due and payable on april  we are subject to customary covenants under the agreement and are required to satisfy certain financial and reporting covenants under the agreement 
the agreement is secured by the company s assets  subject to certain exceptions such as certain ip rights 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurements and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent about the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures or change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurements or disclosures 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted asu effective february  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income topic asu 
asu modifies how comprehensive income is presented in an entity s financial statements 
the guidance issued requires an entity to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income  and the total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder s equity 
the revised financial statement presentation for comprehensive income will be effective for us for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we anticipate adopting asu beginning november  we do not anticipate that these changes will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
we do not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effective accounting pronouncements  if adopted  would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures
