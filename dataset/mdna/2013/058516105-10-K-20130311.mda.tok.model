corporate wide restructuring in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors and management approved a corporate wide strategic initiative to refocus our worldwide digital equipment distribution business  services platform and cinema screen manufacturing business and exit the analog projector manufacturing business 
the strategic initiative consisted of selling our omaha  nebraska based analog projector facility and manufacturing equipment and relocating our corporate headquarters to a new  smaller location in omaha  which also houses our network operations center 
in connection with the strategic initiative  we recorded pre tax severance charges of approximately million  including million in and million in severance of million was paid in and million was paid in the remaining million will result in future cash expenditures in in march we sold the analog projector manufacturing machinery and equipment previously identified as available for sale for million  resulting in a gain of million 
in may   we completed the sale of the corporate headquarters in a sale leaseback transaction  resulting in a gain of million 
as part of this transaction  rental expense of million was recorded through november the net cash proceeds from the transaction were million 
the strategic initiative is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of compared to revenues net revenues during the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the year ended december  in thousands theatre products services total theatre revenues lighting total net revenues theatre segment sales of theatre products and services decreased to million in from million in digital product sales sales of digital products decreased in to million from million in this is a decrease of from digital projectors and servers accounted for million of the decrease in sales from  with sales of digital lenses and lamps accounting for the remaining decrease 
a single theatre customer accounted for of digital product sales in  which did not recur in screen product sales we generated screen sales of million in  a decrease of from the million generated in the decrease primarily resulted from customers accelerating their rollout of d systems in prior years thereby decreasing the demand for silver screens in film product sales sales of film projection equipment declined to million in from million in sales of film replacement parts declined to million during from million in  while sales of xenon lamps amounted to million compared to million a year ago 
these declines were expected and sales of these products are expected to continue to decline as the industry continues to transition to digital cinema 
service revenues service revenues increased to million from million in as the motion picture industry s transition to digital cinema resulted in more opportunities for our service team including installation and maintenance of digital projectors 
revenues from servicing digital products rose to million or of all service revenues in from million or in as expected  revenues generated from servicing film equipment decreased to million in compared to million a year ago consistent with the industry transition to digital equipment  resulting from increased demand for installation  maintenance and other services pertaining to the digital conversion 
lighting segment sales of lighting products decreased to million from million during this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in sales of follow spotlights to million from million a year ago and a decrease in parts sales to million in from million in sales of other lighting products remained approximately million in and even though demand for lighting for the venue and entertainment sectors of the construction business is still slow  we are moving to focus on a growing segment  architectural accent lighting 
foreign revenues sales outside the united states primarily from the theatre segment decreased to million from million in although sales in canada and south america increased  sales decreased in the remaining export markets 
the largest decreases occurred in china 
export declines in china and other foreign markets are reflective of highly competitive environments combined with sensitivity to the timing of the digital cinema rollout in these countries as well as diminishing film equipment sales 
export sales are also sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that lead to volatility in the market 
gross profit consolidated gross profit decreased to million from million in and as a percent of total revenue decreased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment decreased to million from million in and as a percentage of theatre sales decreased to from a year ago 
our gross margin decreased from the prior year due to a higher concentration of lower margin digital equipment and lamps and a lower concentration of screen sales  which carry strong margins  as well as pricing decreases due to a competitive market 
gross profit in the lighting segment amounted to million or as a percentage of revenues in compared to million or as a percentage of revenues in selling expenses selling expenses increased to million from million in and as a percentage of revenues increased to from a year ago 
the increase in selling expenses is due to higher wages and commissions 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and amounted to and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to recruiting costs  higher professional fees and consultants used in the asia operations offset by lower severance charges 
segment operating income we generated operating income in the theatre segment of million in compared to million in the results reflect a decrease of million in theatre product operating income to million in  from million in operating income of theatre services decreased million to million in compared to million a year ago 
the lighting segment generated an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in other financial items our results for reflect income of million pertaining to our share of equity in the income from digital link ii  llc compared to a loss of million in the change in reflects the improvement in the llc s net income and sales of equipment by the llc to customers for projectors previously held in the llc as compared to other income amounted to million in compared to million in the results primarily reflect the impact of exchange gains and losses due primarily to the us dollar fluctuating against the canadian dollar from year to year 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million in compared to million in the effective tax rate calculated as a ratio of income tax expense to pretax earnings  inclusive of equity method investment income losses was approximately for and in the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates primarily as a result of differing foreign and us tax rates applied to respective pre tax earnings by tax jurisdiction 
the effective tax rate increased in from due to lower earnings before tax for the canada and asia operations  which have lower tax rates and a reduction in the expected credits the company will earn in compared to for the reasons outlined herein  we generated net earnings of approximately million and basic and diluted earnings per share of  compared to million and basic and diluted earnings per share of and in  respectively 
compared to revenues net revenues during the twelve months ended december  rose to million from million in in thousands theatre products services total theatre revenues lighting total net revenues theatre segment sales of theatre products and services increased to million in from million in digital product sales sales of digital products rose to million from million in due to the following a significant sale of digital equipment to a theatre customer which represented approximately of digital product revenues during a general increase in sales volume in the us as theatre exhibition companies continued to convert their theatre complexes to digital based projection equipment 
sales of lamps rose to million from million in while sales of servers rose to million from million in we also continued to integrate projection equipment in our omaha plant for a large exhibition customer 
revenues generated from the accessories we sell with the integration services increased to million in from million in we do expect this integration business to substantially decline after fiscal due to the exhibition customer s digital conversion being substantially completed 
screen product sales revenues from the sale of screens decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower demand for digital d screens 
sales were at record levels in as exhibition companies pushed to capture the relative new d movie box office during the period 
we sell screens for both digital cinema and film applications 
in some instances  a screen can be used interchangeably with either a digital projector or a film projector 
however  there are certain digital d applications such as the technology by reald that require special silver screens that we manufacture 
film product sales the transition to digital cinema has impacted sales of film equipment  accessories and replacement parts and these products are expected to further decline in future periods 
as expected  sales declined year over year as follows sales of projection equipment declined to million from million 
replacement part sales declined to million from million 
sales of lamps declined to million from million 
service revenues service revenues increased to million from million in resulting from increased demand for installation  maintenance and other services pertaining to the digital conversion 
digital service revenues rose to million from million in as the rollout is creating opportunities for our service group to sell a range of services including  but not limited to  installations  after sale maintenance  repairs  cabling  wiring and noc services 
the industry transition to digital is affecting revenues from servicing film equipment which declined to million from million in lighting segment sales of lighting products declined slightly to million from million during due to lower demand for follow spotlights 
lighting products have been impacted by the effects of economic conditions as a significant portion of the business is dependent on the construction or improvements of stadiums and auditoriums around the world 
foreign revenues sales outside of the united states primarily from the theatre segment fell to million from million in resulting in large part to sales volume in mainland china decreasing to million from million in the results out of china reflect increased competition and the shifting of scheduled installations due to changing theatre construction timelines 
we also experienced lower sales volume in south america  canada  mexico and europe 
the results were primarily due to the timing of the digital cinema rollout in these countries coupled with lower sales of film equipment 
export sales are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that can lead to volatility 
certain areas of the world are more cost conscious than the us market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify selling into these regions 
additionally  foreign exchange rates and excise taxes sometimes make it difficult to market our products overseas at reasonable selling prices 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million from million in but as a percent of total revenue decreased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment increased to million from million in but as a percentage of theatre sales decreased to from a year ago 
the higher gross profit was due to the increase in sales volume while the decline in gross margin is reflective of higher sales of digital products which carry substantially higher revenue price points but lower gross margins than our other products and services 
lower screen revenues which carry higher manufacturing margins 
lower revenues from film replacement parts which historically carry strong margins 
the gross profit in the lighting segment amounted to million or a gross margin of compared to million or a gross margin of during the results primarily reflect a favorable product mix during selling expenses selling expenses increased to million from million in but as a percent of total revenue declined to from in the results principally reflect additional personnel and their associated costs to expand our domestic sales and service marketing efforts and to expand our sales offices in mainland china 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses rose to million in from million in but as a percent of total revenue decreased to from in the increase in expenses was due to severance charges of million during the year coupled with additional personnel and related costs necessary to manage the significant growth in revenue experienced during the year 
approximately million of the severance charges occurred in the fourth quarter and were a result of a strategic initiative to refocus certain key areas of our company as discussed throughout this document 
segment operating income we generated operating income in the theatre segment of million in compared to million in the results reflect an increase in business where product revenues rose 
we also generated significantly higher operating profit from our service business which increased to million from million in on a revenue increase of 
operating income from the lighting segment rose to million from less than million in due to a favorable product mix 
other financial items our results for reflect a loss of million pertaining to our share of equity in the loss from digital link ii  llc compared to income of million in the change from reflects less sales of equipment by the llc to customers for projectors previously held in the llc compared to the loss in primarily was a result of depreciation expense 
other income amounted to million in compared to expense of million in the results primarily reflect the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses due primarily to the us dollar fluctuating against the canadian dollar from year to year

in addition  our effective rate was lower than the prior year period in part due to estimates for certain canadian tax credits 
for the reasons outlined herein  we generated net earnings of approximately million and basic and diluted earnings per share of and in  respectively compared to million and basic and diluted earnings per share of and in  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources during the past several years  we have met our working capital and capital resource needs from either our operating or investing cash flows or a combination of both 
we ended fiscal year with total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the company reported negative operating cash flows for the year ended december  this is largely due to the timing of payments related to the higher volume of business in the latter part of the company believes that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash and cash equivalents  borrowing availability  and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our projected capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we are a party to a million revolving credit agreement and note collectively  the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo 
we may request an increase in the credit agreement of up to an additional million  however  any advances on the additional million are subject to approval of wells fargo 
the borrowings from the credit agreement are to be used for working capital purposes and for other general corporate purposes 
our accounts receivable  general intangibles and inventory secure the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus basis points at december  
interest is paid on a monthly basis 
we pay a fee of per annum on any unused portion 
the credit agreement expires on june  at which time all unpaid principal and interest would be due

since the inception of the revolving credit agreement  no amounts have been borrowed 
as of december   million of the million in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a portion of these funds when repatriated back to the us cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  and the effect of working capital changes 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  which included net income of million  plus non cash charges benefits for gain on assets  deferred tax expense  depreciation and amortization  reserve provisions and non cash stock compensation totaling million 
changes in working capital used cash from operating activities of million 
this is primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable  as well as accruals and timing of tax deposits  partially offset by a decrease in the balance of accounts  unbilled and notes receivables and other current assets 
accounts payable decreased million as the company paid for fourth quarter inventory purchases 
accounts receivable balances decreased million due to collections of the higher sales volume of the prior fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million during the results reflect million in net income plus net non cash charges of million 
changes in working capital provided cash of million 
this change is primarily due to a million decrease in inventory and increases in customer deposits deferred revenue and current income taxes payable partially offset by a million increase in accounts  unbilled and notes receivables and increases in other current assets 
changes in receivables  inventory  unbilled revenue and customer deposits primarily resulted from the sale to a significant theatre customer recorded in the latter part of the third quarter of net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in  which included net income of million plus net non cash charges of million 
changes in working capital used cash of million  driven by increases in accounts receivable  unbilled revenue  inventory and other assets partially offset by increases in account payable and in income taxes payable 
these working capital changes resulted from the significant increase in business coupled with the significantly higher price point of the digital equipment purchased and distributed

the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates increased decreased cash and cash equivalents by million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
transactions with related and certain other parties there were no transactions with related and certain other parties during financial instruments and credit risk concentrations the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues and were from the theatre segment 
trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately of net consolidated receivables at december  sales to cdf holdings represented approximately of total sales and accounts receivable from cdf represented of net consolidated receivables 
the note receivable from cdf had an outstanding balance of million at december  additionally  receivables from belmont capital group represented approximately of net consolidated receivables at december  while the company believes its relationships with such customers are stable  most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party 
a significant decrease or interruption in business from the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the company sells its products 
financial instruments that potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable and notes receivable 
we sell product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions 
to minimize credit concentration risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition or use letters of credit 
hedging and trading activities the company s primary exposure to foreign currency fluctuations pertains to its subsidiaries in canada and china 
in certain instances  the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of this risk 
for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million of realized and unrealized gains associated with these contracts in its consolidated statement of operations 
we do not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts at fair value 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements consist principally of leasing various assets under operating leases 
the future estimated payments under these arrangements are summarized below along with our other contractual obligations contractual obligations total payments less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands postretirement benefits operating leases contractual cash obligations the schedule above excludes the following items we have issued a million standby financial letter of credit to our landlord as we completed the buildout of the new office space which expires in early we do not expect to make any future payments pertaining to the letter of credit 
we have accrued approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the financial statements as tax liability  including interest and penalties  in accordance with fin as of december  amounts for which the year of settlement occurs cannot be reasonably estimated 
there were no other material contractual obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
seasonality generally  our business exhibits a moderate level of seasonality 
legal see note to the consolidated financial statements  and item of this report  for a description of legal matters 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net revenues or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
current year adoption of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding our adoption of accounting pronouncements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements which the company believes will materially impact its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured the company recognizes revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
if an arrangement involves multiple deliverables  the items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of their fair values 
revenues from the arrangement are allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their objectively determined fair value 
for services  revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered 
revenues from service and support contracts is deferred and recognized as earned ratably over the service coverage periods 
unbilled revenue represents revenue recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy for which the invoice had not been processed and sent to the customer 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product  however  there are certain instances where revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery or customer acceptance of the product as the company legally retains the risk of loss on these transactions until such time 
estimates used in the recognition of revenues and cost of revenues include  but are not limited to  estimates for product warranties  price allowances and product returns 
costs related to revenues are recognized in the same period in which the specific revenues are recorded 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue 
shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are included in cost of sales 
estimates used in the recognition of revenues and cost of revenues include  but are not limited to  estimates for product warranties  price allowances and product returns 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and overhead 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable values are management s estimates related to customer demand and the development of new technology  which could make our theatre and lighting products obsolete  among other items 
management has managed these risks in the past and believes that it can manage them in the future  however  operating margins may suffer if they are unable to effectively manage these risks 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we use an estimate of our annual effective rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances at the time while the actual effective rate is calculated at year end 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing whether the deferred tax assets are realizable management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
if it would be determined that some or all of these assets would not be realized  valuation reserves would be required which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions in a two step process  whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  we would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 
our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxable authorities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products throughout the united states and the world 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic conditions 
as a majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar can and sometimes has made our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest rates we have a variable interest rate credit facility  however  we have no outstanding balances as of december  if we would borrow up to the maximum amount available under these facilities  a one percent increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by million per annum 
interest rate risks from our other interest related accounts such as our postretirement obligations are not deemed significant 
we currently have long term notes receivables bearing interest rates of which are recorded at fair value 
a change in long term interest rates for comparable types of instruments would have the effect of us recording changes in fair value through our statement of operations 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are primarily related to our china and canadian subsidiaries 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions 
at december   we had no such foreign currency contracts outstanding 
a portion of our cash in the china and canadian subsidiaries is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million
