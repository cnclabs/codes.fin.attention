industry overview the local smb advertising and commerce market smbs serving local markets represent significant economic activity  control substantial purchasing power and address the needs of hundreds of millions of consumers 
these smbs include businesses such as lawyers  physicians  car dealers  dentists  plumbers  florists and local operations of national chains 
to generate and sustain their businesses  smbs spend money to market their services and to acquire  maintain and retain customers  and the associated expenditures are critical components of the operating budget for many smbs  particularly given the potential value of each customer over the lifetime of the relationship 
for example  a new dental patient may generate several hundred dollars in revenue during the first visit  thousands of dollars in subsequent visits and make referrals to friends and family that generate significant additional revenue 
in addition to their customer acquisition efforts  increasingly smbs are looking for platforms that enable them to transact with their customers online 
these efforts to manage the entire customer experience online from lead generation to transaction execution to overall customer management are key to the success of smbs 
an smb s owner and operator is also typically its chief marketing officer because the business is too small to justify hiring dedicated marketing personnel 
companies that operate traditional offline media formats  such as the yellow pages  newspapers  radio stations and direct mail publishers  adapted to the limited amount of time and effort that smb owners and operators are normally able to devote to advertising and marketing by developing products  distribution and service delivery models that greatly simplified the marketing process for smbs 
the products sold by these offline media companies namely  space in their directories and periodicals or time on the radio and television were easy to understand eg  a flat  a month for a quarter page ad in the yellow pages 
because of their scale  these traditional offline media companies were able to deploy direct local sales forces that walked into the smb s place of business  presented a media package that gave the smb broad customer reach through a single advertising purchase  assisted in the creation of the media advertisement for the smb and ultimately asked the smb to do little more than write a check 
the smb owner and operator was able to focus his or her efforts on running the business with little attention to these marketing efforts 
marketing in the offline world for an smb was therefore relatively straightforward 
there were a limited number of advertising channels  the channel owners sent dedicated personnel to visit and serve the smb  and the smb did not need to invest resources in managing the process 
the digitization of local advertising and local commerce over the past decade  the local advertising market for smbs and other local businesses has undergone rapid and fundamental changes 
the delivery and consumption of local advertising  like all media  is becoming increasingly fragmented and digitized 
many consumers who used to search for a local business in the yellow pages or the local newspaper are now going online and searching on google  checking reviews on yelp and citysearch  buying coupons on groupon and livingsocial  and asking their friends for their opinions through facebook and twitter 
in addition  consumers have begun to directly book and buy local services online that traditionally were only booked or bought off line 
existing offerings from companies such as opentable finding a restaurant as well as new offerings from companies such as zocdoc finding a doctor and uber booking and buying car services consolidate many of the steps of acquiring and transacting with a customer into a single simple online experience 
this consumer led digital transformation has profoundly disrupted the ways that businesses of all sizes need to acquire  transact with  maintain and retain their customers 
as the internet continues to grow and evolve  we believe that these trends will accelerate 
to keep pace with this transformation  we believe that smbs need to follow their customers and move an increasing portion of their marketing efforts and spend online 
page the local challenge the growth of local online advertising spend has  however  significantly lagged the increase in online media consumption 
we believe that this lag is the result of two significant challenges the product challenge re create with online media the ease of purchasing and breadth of customer reach to which smbs are accustomed with offline media 
for owners and operators of smbs  building an efficient and effective online marketing presence is a significant challenge  especially given the highly fragmented landscape of digital media publishers 
in addition  smbs want to manage the entire customer experience from lead generation to transaction execution to overall customer management through a single technology platform 
while it is possible for an smb to purchase various products that address these needs on an a la carte basis  we believe that these products do not address the fundamental needs and business realities of the smb advertiser  which include a lack of time and resources to research and integrate the various solution providers  lack of expertise  lack of transparency into performance  and lack of economic incentive relative to the time required 
the distribution challenge re create the ability to sell local online advertising products to smbs in the manner to which they are accustomed purchasing offline advertising products 
selling advertising to smbs is difficult  and creating and sustaining a local sales force to address the smb market requires substantial investment 
the smb market is fragmented  and smb owners and operators are busy running their businesses and have little time to consider new marketing options 
accordingly  smbs require a third party to work with them in developing their marketing strategy 
the reachlocal solution we combine advanced  publisher agnostic technology and an experienced  digitally sophisticated direct sales force to provide smbs with a single  easy to use and cost effective solution to acquire  maintain and retain customers using digital media 
our target market is smbs that spend at least  per year on advertising 
the product solution our rl platform addresses the needs of the smb and re creates the simplicity and effectiveness with which smbs have traditionally purchased offline advertising 
our product solutions include the following key features one check the internet budget 
through the simplicity of a single internet advertising budget  the rl platform allows us to connect smbs to multiple online publishers 
we connect the smb to a broad range of destinations on the internet  including major search engines such as google  yahoo  bing  aol and ask 
com  an extensive network of local search and directory sites such as superpages  citysearch  local 
com  magicyellow and others  leading display advertising networks such as yahoo right media and the google display network  and leading social media sites  such as facebook and twitter 
the rl platform automates connections to publicly available  self service advertising and social media platforms through application programming interfaces  or apis  specific to those platforms 
the rl platform also allows us to provide smbs with access to a greater breadth of media because we are able to leverage our significant customer base to gain access to advertising inventory typically unavailable to an smb with a modest advertising budget 
by combining these features  the rl platform allows us to offer smbs the simplicity of a single internet advertising budget that connects them to a diverse array of online publishers 
page do it for me end to end execution 
the rl platform is a proprietary  end to end technology platform that enables us to execute an online marketing campaign on behalf of an smb 
the rl platform is a software based solution that combines back end automation and optimization technologies to manage advertising spend across a broad array of online publishers and media outlets 
for advertisers interested in search engine marketing  the rl platform automates the build up of keyword search criteria for the leading search engines using a library of more than million keywords 
the rl platform matches  sets and optimizes the bids for these keywords based on the smb s products and services as well as the smb s targeted geographic areas 
for advertisers interested in display advertising  the rl platform places display advertisements on websites selected in accordance with an smb s target geographic  demographic and behavioral profiles 
for advertisers seeking social media and web presence solutions  the rl platform integrates with leading social media sites  such as facebook and twitter 
do it better than i can efficient and optimized buying 
the rl platform runs a set of proprietary algorithms multiple times a day to evaluate each publisher and each keyword and dynamically shifts spend to continuously optimize and improve the performance of our smbs campaigns 
we have run tens of thousands of online marketing campaigns for smbs  and this scale and experience in purchasing online advertising from publishers allows us to make more efficient and effective purchasing decisions on behalf of our clients 
prove it calls  not just clicks 
we employ a proprietary reverse proxy technology that automatically tracks campaign generated activity  such as phone calls  e mails and site navigation  without requiring the smb to alter its website or maintain a separate website 
smbs can log in to the rl platform to monitor their advertising spend on a daily basis and determine  for example  which online campaign generated which phone call 
in addition  the rl platform allows the smb to use reverse lookup technology to see who called and provides a recording of each phone call 
the ability of our rl platform to allow smbs to track accurately offline activity principally phone calls is a critical source of differentiation from available self service online advertising platforms  which currently provide smbs no data regarding offline activity 
each of our products includes  through a single budget  access to multiple publishers  some of which are not available to smbs  as well as access to our proprietary optimization and tracking technologies that dynamically adjust the publishers to which we allocate clients media spend in order to meet their performance objectives 
in addition  powered by our rl platform  we also offer non media based digital marketing solutions  such as reachcast  totallivechat 
in addition  in  we will be offering a number of other products and services to support the online marketing and local commerce needs of our smb clients  such as reachsite  reachconvert and reachcommerce 
for these reasons  while we rely on third party publishers for the substantial majority of the media we purchase on behalf of our clients  we are not simply a reseller of media  rather  we market our products as a complete package of services intended to drive the success of our clients 
the distribution solution our distribution solution is built around a direct  locally based sales force of imcs who  empowered by the rl platform  engage with our clients to help them achieve their marketing objectives in the consultative manner to which smbs are accustomed 
the key characteristics of our imc sales force are as follows internet focused and trained 
our imcs are focused on selling internet based advertising products 
this exclusive focus is unlike the sales forces of existing offline media companies that cross sell online and offline advertising  often with an inherent bias towards their own offline products 
locally based 
our imcs are located in markets in north america  australia  the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  japan and brazil where their clients are based  enabling them to provide the personal connection that is necessary for the imc to develop and maintain a relationship with our clients 
in our experience  our direct local clients  a substantial majority of which we calculate spend from to  per month  require face to face interaction that is consistent with the way the smb has historically purchased offline media 
consultative 
our imcs are trained to consult with  educate and guide smbs through the opportunities arising from and mechanics of purchasing online advertising 
in addition  we have a separate sales channel targeting national brands with operations in multiple local markets and select third party agencies and resellers 
page we believe that the reachlocal solution  a combination of technology and human capital  gives our smb clients access to technology and media that they could not access by themselves  and we prove that it works in ways they understand 
we allow smbs to write a single check while we do the rest 
the reachlocal advantage we have been a pioneer in addressing the needs of smbs seeking local internet advertising solutions and have focused solely on this market for more than nine years 
scale and experience we have run tens of thousands of online marketing campaigns for smbs 
our scale and experience in purchasing online advertising from publishers allows us to make more efficient and effective purchasing decisions on behalf of our clients 
in addition  the rl platform enables us to connect our smb clients to a wide array of online publishers 
our platform not only allows us to expand the reach of our publisher network  but also allows us quickly to test and identify better performing advertising options for our clients 
in addition  our leadership position in the local internet advertising market provides us with the ability to attract and retain as imcs experienced local salespeople who understand the transformative power of the internet 
client relationships our imcs establish a direct relationship with smb clients 
in and  we generated and  respectively  of our revenue through our direct local channel 
as new online advertising opportunities emerge  such as mobile  video and social media  we believe that having a direct client relationship will enable us to offer additional products and services to our clients 
we are able to leverage both our sales force and the collective purchasing power of our smb clients for the mutual benefit of our clients and third party publishers 
we provide publishers with no or a limited sales force access to smb clients  which  in turn  enables us to offer our smb clients advertising opportunities that they would not be able to obtain on their own 
we believe that adding more publishers will attract additional advertisers which  in turn  will attract still more publishers 
technology running thousands of smb online advertising campaigns simultaneously across multiple publishers poses significant technical challenges 
while technologies exist to help larger companies manage and optimize their online marketing spend  we believe that such solutions are too expensive and too complex to scale down to the typical smb s monthly advertising budget 
we have built our services  systems and networks for maximum scalability and flexibility to manage these types of campaigns  and we have invested heavily in automation technologies that reduce the level of human intervention required to support these campaigns 
this automation is critical to our ability to scale our business and deliver moderately budgeted campaigns in a cost effective manner 
we continually strive to develop technologies that allow us to improve the match of our solutions to the demands of our smb clients 
for example  our development of our reverse proxy technology has opened up a new way for smbs to track and understand the tangible results of their online advertising  enabling us to incorporate offline conversion events  such as phone calls  into the optimization of the client s online marketing campaign 
as we continue to gather online and offline conversion data from marketing campaigns conducted through our rl platform  we will continue to refine our operations to increase efficiencies and generate better results for our smb clients 
our strategy we believe that we are in the early stages of a large and long term business opportunity presented by the shift of local marketing budgets from traditional media formats to digital media formats 
our strategy for pursuing this opportunity includes the following key components continue to expand the reach of our imc sales force 
we intend to continue to increase the size of our traditional imc sales force in selective territories  particularly internationally 
in addition  starting in  we began testing an inside sales force to address second and third tier markets 
we believe that these markets  while smaller  still present significant opportunities for growth  and the use of an inside sales force enables us to pursue those smaller markets in a more cost effective fashion 
in  we intend to roll out our inside sales efforts more broadly in north america 
expand internationally 
the local challenge is a global one  and we have found our product and distribution solutions to be well received in our international markets 
generally  our international imcs are more productive than our domestic imcs and we therefore intend to continue growing our international sales force and make other investments in service of those markets 
page increase imc productivity 
we intend to continue to invest in our service delivery model and our sales approach to provide our imcs with additional capacity and tools to manage and acquire more advertisers 
for example  we are in the process of organizing our sales and service organization into verticals so that we can leverage greater subject matter expertise  we continue to explore different staffing approaches to enhance the imc s opportunity to focus on new client acquisition  and we are deploying additional technology to make the selling process more efficient 
expand media offerings 
we have developed a platform that enables us more easily to connect our smb advertisers to a broader array of online publishers and  in the future  to reach customers through new formats such as mobile and video 
our plan has been  and continues to be  to fulfill  track and optimize an smb s entire digital media plan  regardless of media property or format 
in addition  in we launched our reachretargeting product  a display advertising solution that targets consumers who have searched for a client s keywords and those who have visited a client s website 
develop digital marketing software solutions 
our current products target our clients needs to acquire customers through online media buying 
we believe that there will be continued movement towards digital platforms in the other segments of an smb s marketing activities  such as marketing automation  lead conversion and customer relationship management 
to address these and other needs  we plan to continue investing in the internal development or potential acquisition of products and services in these adjacent segments 
for example  we recently announced the beta release of reachconvert  a saas marketing automation solution designed to increase our client s ability to track  respond to and convert leads 
reachconvert is based on the technology we acquired in the acquisition of the assets of real practice in we will continue to focus on expanding our relationship and utility to our clients through product innovation and new marketing solutions 
develop new products supporting local transactions 
our original focus was to solve the local marketing problem for smbs by developing innovative solutions to help them generate leads from local consumers 
a natural extension of those efforts is to enable the consumers to digitally book and buy from the smb 
to that end  we are developing a new saas product  reachcommerce  that enables local businesses to take their entire booking and buying process online 
in addition to providing a better consumer experience  reachcommerce also digitizes the merchant s back office operation  including scheduling  employee and fleet management  estimating  transaction processing  invoicing  and business intelligence and reporting 
reachcommerce is expected to be released in beta in north america in the product will initially be focused on merchants in the home services vertical 
develop new consumer solution to offer local services online 
we recently began testing a new consumer service  clublocal through which we create a direct relationship with consumers and provide home related services by engaging third party suppliers who perform the agreed services on our behalf 
clublocal enables consumers to instantly book various home services via its website or mobile app 
clublocal began testing in dallas fort worth in july and we are expecting to launch a second clublocal beta market in san francisco in products and services we offer a comprehensive suite of smb focused online marketing and reporting solutions  including search engine marketing  display advertising  remarketing  digital presence and online marketing analytics  all of which run on our rl platform 
reachsearch 
our reachsearch product is focused on assuring that our clients advertisements appear prominently among the search results when local consumers enter certain keywords on leading local search sites such as google  yahoo and bing 
the rl platform is directly integrated into the advertising platforms of these and other leading search engines via apis 
in addition  as part of the reachsearch product  our smb clients also receive placement in the search results of our extensive network of online publishers and directory sites called the reachlocal search network 
this network provides additional qualified local traffic to the smb and allows the smb to reach potential customers across a broader range of sites 
the rl platform automatically matches keywords for a business products or services through its extensive category taxonomy and keyword library  and its optimization engine dynamically adjusts keyword level bids based on which keywords at which publishers are driving the most online leads and phone calls at the lowest price 
based on the smb s business and targeted geographic area  the rl platform automatically paces the smb s target monthly budget and allocates and optimizes that budget across search publishers 
our reachsearch product was introduced in page reachdisplay 
our reachdisplay product is primarily focused on maximizing the exposure for an smb that wants to broadcast a message to a specific target online audience 
there are various reachdisplay products that allow an smb to target different demographic  vertical and behavioral customer segments 
for general exposure in a specific geographic area  the reachdisplay awareness package provides the smb with reach across a network of sites 
for advertisers wishing to target by vertical or by specific customer behavior  we offer additional display packages 
for example  the reachdisplay automotive package provides smbs in the automotive vertical access to audiences visiting automotive sites as well as customers whose previous behavior indicates that they may be in the market to purchase a car 
we offer more than different display advertising products across a wide variety of publishing partners  including yahoo right media  google display network  facebook and other display networks and demand side platforms 
our reachdisplay product was introduced in and we continue to add new publishers and options as display advertising on the internet evolves 
reachcast 
reachcast was introduced in and combines a proprietary technology platform with an expert service team to help smbs build and optimize their web presence for the purpose of driving online search discovery  powering reputation management  and managing social media marketing 
as part of the reachcast service  each smb is partnered with an expert web presence professional  or wpp  who works directly with the business to develop a strategy to meet their specific goals  starting with a consultation and initial setup of reachcast and presence creation across google  facebook  twitter and local directories 
then  in consultation with the business  the wpp regularly creates and publishes custom content  posts to social media sites  engages with fans and followers  and monitors online reputation 
reachretargeting 
our remarketing and search retargeting products allow us to target consumers who have previously visited a specific client s website  either through a reachsearch campaign or a reachdisplay campaign  or who have previously searched for a client s keywords 
when the potential customer visits any other site within our remarketing network  we can remarket to the target customer on behalf of that smb 
because many purchases from local merchants involve an extended research process  providing the smb with the ability to stay in front of a potential customer who has expressed an initial interest can lead to sales that might not have resulted from a single advertising impression 
our remarketing product  reachretargeting  which we introduced in  can be purchased on a standalone basis or can be bundled into the reachsearch and reachdisplay product lines 
reachconvert 
reachconvert is a saas product that helps businesses manage their leads and convert more of them into customers 
reachconvert notifies the business of new leads in real time via text message  email or the reachlocal mobile app  so that the business can follow up within minutes 
reachconvert helps the business stay top of mind during the customer decision making process by automatically sending new prospects targeted emails and sending alerts to the business s staff reminding them to follow up on each lead 
reachconvert is currently in beta in north america 
totaltrack  totallivechat  totalvideonow  totalbannernow 
as part of our mission to provide a comprehensive suite of digital marketing solutions to smbs  we have developed various products to address specific marketing needs  such as lead optimization  online analytics and digital creative solutions 
distribution we distribute our products and services directly though our sales force of imcs  who are focused on serving smbs in their local markets  as well as a separate sales force targeting national brands with operations in multiple local markets and select third party agencies and resellers 
internet marketing consultants our imcs generally sell our services directly to our smb clients through an in person  consultative sales process 
over time  an individual imc can build a valuable relationship with his or her clients by delivering measurable results via the rl platform 
our imcs are trained to explain the benefits of a digitally focused marketing strategy to smbs which are generally preoccupied with operating and managing their businesses 
as an imc develops a portfolio of smb clients  the imc is responsible for calling on and maintaining contact with each client  working with each client to evaluate the performance of its digital campaigns and discussing available options and opportunities to extend or expand each client s digital spend strategy 
in addition  in we launched a beta inside sales force to address second and third tier markets 
page our imcs are located in markets in north america  australia  the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  japan and brazil 
we make a significant investment in the hiring  training and ongoing support of our imcs while they develop a portfolio of smb clients 
our imc development program divides imcs into two groups underclassmen  which consists of imcs during their first months of employment  and upperclassmen  which consists of imcs with more than months of employment 
increasing the number of our imcs has been the principal engine for our growth 
in particular  our growth is driven by the increase in the number of upperclassmen  who are significantly more productive than our underclassmen 
our recruitment  training and performance system is designed with the objective of increasing the number of our upperclassmen over time and increasing the percentage of underclassmen who become upperclassmen 
at december   we had underclassmen and upperclassmen 
we have created a system to identify and develop our underclassmen into upperclassmen  key elements of which include recruitment 
we invest heavily in recruiting our sales force and have developed an in house team of specialized recruiters 
typically  each month we hire imcs worldwide  with the hiring weighted towards the first months of the year 
imc recruits are generally required to have at least three to five years of sales experience  preferably serving the smb market 
we generally seek experience selling online advertising and require that all imc hires be technically proficient 
although many recruits come from traditional media companies where they have sold to the smb market  we seek imcs who understand the transformative power of the internet and who have seen  first hand  the flow of advertising dollars online 
training 
each imc attends a mandatory one week boot camp training session at our sales headquarters in plano  texas or  for international imcs  a similar boot camp closer to their principal office locations 
during the week  imcs learn our business model and their responsibilities in it  learn the fundamentals of search engine and display marketing and social media and reputation management  and are trained on the rl platform and our suite of products 
once an imc returns to his or her specific office  the imc engages in a standard onboarding process that includes hands on instruction in prospecting smb clients  scheduling and tracking appointments  and developing presentations for prospective clients 
during the remainder of their first months  underclassmen are required to participate in ongoing training sessions that include general industry updates  rl platform updates and presentations from upperclassmen who provide guidance on how to sell to and serve specific smb verticals 
focus on performance 
in order to track performance and underscore expectations  underclassmen are provided a roadmap of expected performance milestones and receive constant support and counseling during this period to assist them in meeting the milestones and otherwise building a portfolio of smb clients 
we also use this support system to identify and try to remediate any problems if an imc s performance deviates too far from expected revenue contributions 
with each new class of imcs  we track how the imcs are performing relative to a standard level of revenue growth and other performance metrics for each month after their training 
we do not expect all underclassmen to become upperclassmen  and our investment decisions anticipate the cost of attrition 
we maintain data on the past and current performance of our imcs  which we use as a basis for our hiring decisions 
the performance of past and current imcs allows us to adjust our investment model in the event there are significant changes in macroeconomic or competitive conditions 
national brands  agencies and resellers we have a separate sales force targeting national brands with operations in multiple local markets eg  franchise organizations as well as a number of third party agencies and resellers 
the sales process for national brands can differ from the process employed by our imcs and often requires an endorsement by  and potentially a direct financial contribution from  the parent entity such as a franchisor 
if a local operation of one of our national brands requires face to face contact with a local sales representative  we are able to offer one of our imcs to service that local operation 
in addition  we sell and provide access to our rl platform to select third party agencies and resellers in customer segments where they have a sales force with established relationships with their smb client base 
we currently have over agencies and resellers actively selling on our rl platform 
we have a team that is responsible for identifying potential agencies and resellers  training their sales forces to sell our products and services and supporting the relationships on an ongoing basis

page customer service our customer service organization is responsible for providing ongoing support to our sales forces  advertisers and resellers  including technical assistance with the use of the rl platform  as well as providing product and campaign specific technical assistance and recommendations to our smb clients 
we also field an advanced campaign management team that is responsible for supporting and optimizing the overall performance of the products on a category by category level 
our rl platform has a set of administrator only tools that is used by the campaign management team to efficiently evaluate the success of ongoing campaigns and to recommend ways for our clients to improve their performance 
with a combination of employees in each of our regional markets and  india  we have a dedicated team focused on the provisioning and review of campaigns before they are deployed 
this team is responsible for reviewing the keywords that are automatically generated by the rl platform  ensuring that the creative aspects of the campaign and editorial standards conform to best practices and overseeing the reverse proxy services for our clients 
this team employs automated tools to increase the number of campaigns that can be provisioned per person  per day 
our team of web presence professionals is responsible for the delivery of the reachcast service  which includes creating and publishing custom content  posting to social media sites  engaging with fans and followers  and monitoring online reputation

the customers of clublocal are the consumers to whom the services being offered 
competition the market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing  and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition  longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets  as well as substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases 
our competitors include internet marketing providers 
we compete with large internet marketing providers such as google  yahoo and microsoft 
these providers typically offer their products and services through disparate  online only  self service platforms 
we compete with these companies on the basis of our imc sales force  our product offerings and our publisher agnostic services to our clients 
although we compete against the self service offerings of these large providers  we also have business relationships with them and we believe we are an important customer for their locally targeted search inventory 
we also believe that we provide a valuable service to these companies by connecting them to a large number of smbs  which are generally disinclined to purchase online advertising via self service platforms 
traditional  offline media companies 
we compete with traditional yellow page and newspaper companies with large  direct sales forces 
while these traditional media companies have made investments to address the migration of advertising expenditures away from their existing print products  we believe that they face the prospect of cannibalizing their existing higher margin products that they own and the challenge of re training and restructuring their sales forces  most of whom have only sold print products and many of whom still receive the majority of their income from selling those products 
we compete with these companies on the basis of the strength and breadth of our technology platform and product offering and our focus exclusively on internet advertising 
other smb marketing providers 
we also compete with technology companies providing online marketing platforms focused on the smb market such as angie s list and yelp  as well as newer market entrants  such as groupon and livingsocial  which are actively focused on new forms of online marketing solutions for smbs and in some cases building significant direct sales forces 
we compete with these companies based on our scale  technological platform  breadth of product suite  size and geographic scope of our imcs and established publisher relationships 
new competitors in new markets 
we have recently launched a new consumer service  clublocal  through which we create a direct relationship with consumer and provide home related services by engaging third party suppliers who perform the agreed services on our behalf 
we are also developing and launching new saas products  such as reachconvert and reachcommerce  designed to provide smbs tools to convert leads to customers  retain customers  and transact with customers 
in each case  as we enter new markets we will encounter new competitors 
government regulation we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  tariffs  user privacy  data protection  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  electronic contracts and other communications  consumer protection  broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of services 
it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and operating results

risks related to our business our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and the trading price of our common stock 
our current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we commenced operations in late in north america  and developed a strategy for taking advantage of what we believe is a shift of local marketing budgets from traditional media formats to digital media formats 
our strategy allowed us to grow rapidly 
however  our growth rate in north america has slowed and  as a result  our overall growth rate has also declined 
in  our north america revenues  which accounted for of our revenues  grew by versus growth in we are expanding internationally and introducing new products to continue to grow our business  but we cannot assure you that our strategy will be successful and that our growth rate will not decline further 
in particular  although our international imcs are now considerably more productive than our north american imcs  over time as those markets mature  international imcs productivity may decline  putting further pressure on our growth rate and results of operations 
you must also consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter as a company in the rapidly evolving online marketing industry 
these risks and difficulties include our limited number of product offerings and the difficulties and risks associated with developing and selling new product offerings  including  in particular  software as a service and consumer products  successfully entering new markets  domestically and internationally  maintaining the effectiveness of our rl platform  and adapting our technology to new market opportunities and challenges  competition from existing and new competitors  reaching and maintaining profitability  continuing to attract new smb clients  many of whom have not previously advertised online and may not understand the value to their businesses of our products and services  and effectively managing continued growth in our sales force  personnel and operations 
failing to successfully address these challenges or others could significantly harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
page we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  and we may incur net operating losses in the future 
we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations 
our business strategy contemplates hiring significant numbers of additional imcs  both in new and existing markets  as well as making substantial investments in new and existing products  which will require significant expenditures 
if our revenue does not grow to offset these increased expenses  we will not be profitable 
we also expect that a variety of factors  including increased competition and the maturation of our business  may continue to cause our revenue growth rate to decline in the future  and we cannot assure you that our revenue will continue to grow or will not decline 
as a result  you should not consider our historical revenue growth as indicative of our future performance 
furthermore  if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our financial performance will be adversely affected 
we purchase most of our media from google  and our business could be adversely affected if google takes actions that are adverse to our interests or if we fail to meet advertiser or spend targets necessary for receiving rebates from google 
similar actions from yahoo  microsoft and other media providers could adversely affect our business  though to a lesser degree 
nearly all of our cost of revenue is for the purchase of media  and a substantial majority of the media we purchase is from google 
google accounts for a large majority of all us searches  and google s share in foreign markets is often even greater 
as a result  we expect that our business will depend upon media purchases from google for the foreseeable future 
this dependence makes us vulnerable to actions that google may take to change the manner in which it sells adwords  as described below  or conducts its business on a number of levels google can choose to change the terms and conditions upon which it does business with us and our advertisers 
google can act unilaterally to change the terms and conditions for our purchase of media or the purchase of google products  and google has done so in the past 
future changes by google to the terms and conditions upon which we purchase media could materially and adversely affect our business 
competitive risk 
google offers its products directly to smbs through an online self service option 
google enjoys substantial competitive advantages over us  such as substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
in addition  google continues to launch products that are targeted directly at smbs  which google does not always make available to third parties 
while we cannot assess at this time the effect of google s offering such products directly to smbs  the prices charged by google for direct service are lower than the prices we charge for the same media 
technology risk 
our rl platform interacts with google through publicly available application programming interfaces  or apis 
if google were to discontinue the availability of all or a portion of these apis to us  we may have to change our technology  incur additional costs or discontinue certain products or services that we currently offer our clients 
any of these changes could adversely affect our ability to provide effective online marketing and reporting solutions to our clients 
in addition  google may decide to alter the amount it charges us for the right to use its apis  which would decrease our gross margin absent any change in our pricing to our customers 
editorial control 
google closely monitors the experience of end users  and from time to time  its editorial personnel request that companies alter their services based on google s determination that aspects of such services could adversely affect the end user experience 
for example  each of our media products includes totaltrack  a tracking service powered by our proprietary reverse proxy technology 
if google were to determine that the tracking urls utilized by our totaltrack service adversely affects the end user s experience  google could require us to alter or suspend the way we implement our tracking solutions 
such a change would significantly decrease our ability to optimize our clients advertising campaigns and limit our ability to provide the level of campaign performance reporting that we currently provide to our clients 
rebate incentive risk 
google retains broad authority with respect to its rebate programs and has  from time to time  canceled rebate programs 
for example  effective december   google terminated a publisher rebate provided as part of its north american authorized adwords reseller program  which was the primary reason that our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in in the second quarter of  we entered into reseller agreements with google that  among other things  provide us with certain performance bonuses if certain advertiser and spend targets  including share of retail requirements  are met 
if we fail to meet those targets  and do not qualify for the rebates  our operating results would be harmed 
our reseller agreements with google are subject to broad mutual termination rights and termination of those agreements would negatively affect our cost of revenue 
page in addition  any new developments or rumors of developments regarding google s business practices that affect the local online advertising industry may create perceptions with our customers or investors that our ability to compete has been impaired 
the above risks also apply to other publishers from whom we purchase media  including yahoo and microsoft 
we purchase a significant majority of our media from google  microsoft and yahoo in an auction marketplace 
if we are unable to purchase media from any one of these companies  if prices for media significantly increase or if the manner in which the media is sold changes  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to purchase media from google  microsoft and yahoo at reasonable prices so that we can provide our clients with a reasonable return on the advertising expenditures they make through us 
we generally purchase this media in an auction marketplace 
increased competition or other factors may cause the cost of the media that we purchase from google  yahoo and microsoft to rise 
in particular  if our expectation that local smb advertising will increasingly migrate to the internet is correct  the marketing budget available to bid in these auctions will increase and the price of media may increase substantially 
an increase in the cost of media in these marketplaces without a corresponding increase in our media buying efficiency could result in an increase in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue even if our business expands 
in addition  such an increase could result in an increase in the prices we must charge our clients or a decrease in our ability to fulfill our clients service expectations 
furthermore  the internet search companies that operate these media marketplaces may change the operating rules or bidding procedures in ways that decrease the effectiveness of the technology that we use to optimize our purchases or otherwise prevent us from purchasing media at reasonable prices or at all 
any change in our ability to provide effective online marketing campaigns to our clients may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
the market in which we participate is intensely competitive  particularly in north america  and if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
the market for online marketing solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing  and with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our competitors include internet marketing providers 
we compete with large internet marketing providers such as google  yahoo and microsoft 
these providers typically offer their products and services through disparate  online only  self service platforms 
traditional  offline media companies 
we compete with traditional yellow page  newspaper  television and radio companies that  in many cases  have large  direct sales forces 
other smb marketing providers 
we also compete with technology companies providing online marketing platforms focused on the smb market such as angie s list and yelp  as well as newer market entrants  such as groupon and livingsocial  which are actively focused on new forms of online marketing solutions for smbs and  in some cases  building significant direct sales forces 
in addition  there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services and may be able to offer such services at highly competitive prices 
new competitors in new markets 
we have recently launched a new consumer service  clublocal  through which we create a direct relationship with customers and provide home related services by engaging third party suppliers who perform the agreed services on our behalf 
we are also developing and launching new software as a service  or saas  products designed to provide smbs tools to convert leads to customers  retain customers  and transact with customers 
in each case  as we enter new markets we will encounter new competitors 
many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition  longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical and other resources and  in some cases  the ability to combine their online marketing products with traditional offline media such as newspapers or yellow pages 
these companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price  develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or client requirements 
in particular  if major internet search companies such as google  yahoo and microsoft decide to devote greater resources to develop and market online advertising offerings directly to smbs  greater numbers of our clients and potential clients may choose to purchase online advertising services directly from these competitors  particularly if and as the ease of their self service models increases 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships with and access to larger client bases and are heavily investing in recruiting sales personnel  which might affect our ability to achieve our imc hiring targets 
page as the market for local online advertising increases  we expect new competitors  business models and solutions to emerge  some of which may be superior to ours 
we also believe that the marketplace for online media is more transparent than other media marketplaces 
our competitors may use information available to them to price their products at a discount to the prices that we currently offer 
clients and potential clients might adopt competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our solutions  even if our online marketing and reporting solutions are more effective than those offered by our competitors  if we are not able to differentiate our products and convince clients that our products are more effective that our competitors offerings 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors 
our future success depends in part on our ability to effectively develop and sell additional products  services and features 
we invest in the development of new products and services with the expectation that we will be able to effectively offer them to our clients 
we are developing  and may in the future develop or acquire  other products and services that address new segments of an smb s marketing activities 
we are also developing new direct to consumer and saas products  which present different challenges from those we have faced in the past 
our future revenue depends in part on our ability to stay competitive with our product and service offerings 
our ability to develop and launch new products on our expected timelines  or at all  is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  such as the difficulties of designing complex software products  achieving desired functionality and integrating the new products with our existing technology 
the sale of new or additional features  products and services  the value or utility of which may be different from our current products and services or less easily understood by our clients  may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts and increased operating expenses  as well as additional training of our imcs and education for our smb clients 
new product launches require the investment of resources in advance of any revenue generation 
if new products fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never realize a return on this investment 
if these efforts are not successful  our business may suffer 
many smbs have modest advertising budgets 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our smb clients will increase their aggregate spending as a result of the introduction of new products and services or that the successful introduction of new products or services will not adversely affect sales of our current products and services through cannibalization of our current products or disharmony created by consumer offerings that could be perceived as in competition with our current customers 
any such adverse impact on our current media products could also adversely affect our publisher rebates 
we may be unsuccessful in managing or growing our international operations  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we currently have international sales operations in australia  the united kingdom  canada  germany  the netherlands japan and brazil  and campaign support services in india 
revenue from international operations outside north america accounted for and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
over the long term  we intend to expand our international operations to new markets and countries 
we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully 
our ability to operate internationally involves various risks  including the need to invest significant resources  the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved in the near future and competitive environments with which we are unfamiliar 
our international operations may not prove to be successful in certain or any markets 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we attempt to establish our presence in particular international markets 
our current and any future international expansion plans will require management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful 
furthermore  in many international markets  we would not be the first entrant  and greater competition may exist with stronger brand recognition than we have faced in our current markets 
different privacy  censorship and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws in foreign countries may cause our business and operating results to suffer 
our international operations may also fail to succeed due to other risks inherent in foreign operations  including difficulties or delays in developing a network of clients in one or more international markets  legal  political or systemic restrictions on the ability of us companies to market products and services or otherwise do business in foreign countries  different regulatory requirements  including regulation of internet services  privacy and data protection  banking and money transmitting  and selling  that may limit or prevent the offering of our products in some jurisdictions  page international intellectual property laws that may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property or permit us to successfully defend ourselves or our intellectual property in international lawsuits  different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  which could make it more difficult to terminate underperforming imcs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations or a weakening us dollar  which can increase costs of international expansion  potential adverse tax consequences  including the difficulty of repatriating money  lack of infrastructure to adequately conduct electronic commerce transactions  and price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency 
as a result of these obstacles  we may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to continue or expand our international operations and replicate our business model  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
failure to adequately recruit  train and retain our internet marketing consultants would impede our growth and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our ability to maintain or grow revenue and achieve profitability will depend  in part  on increasing the size of our direct sales force of imcs 
we divide our imcs into two groups underclassmen  who are imcs during their first months of employment  and upperclassmen  who are imcs with more than months of employment 
generally  upperclassmen are more productive than underclassmen and generate revenue in excess of direct and allocable costs  while underclassmen do not 
accordingly  we rely on the success of our upperclassmen to fund our investment in underclassmen 
as we attempt to achieve larger scale in our business  if our upperclassmen are not as successful as we anticipate  or if our underclassmen do not successfully develop into productive upperclassmen  our ability to grow revenue will suffer  our costs may increase and we may not ever become profitable 
we assume a certain level of attrition when we hire new underclassmen 
we base that assumption on our historical experience and future expectations  and our assumptions may prove wrong 
if our imc attrition is greater than anticipated  our business will be harmed 
in addition  as more companies seek to capitalize on the shift to online media  competition for knowledgeable and qualified online media sales personnel will increase 
moreover  employees that we hire from our competitors have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims of breach of noncompetition and non solicitation obligations owed to their former employers  which could impact our ability to attract and hire high quality candidates and potentially subject us to litigation 
if we are unable to effectively recruit  train and retain imcs  we may not be able to grow our sales force  our revenue may suffer or our costs may increase 
one of our international growth strategies is to enter new international markets through franchise or reseller arrangements  and if one or more of these relationships is unsuccessful  it could negatively impact us 
in july  the company entered into a franchise agreement with oxatasmb bv permitting it to operate and resell our services under the reachlocal brand in slovakia  czech republic  hungary  poland and russia 
at the same time  we entered into a market development loan agreement with oxatasmb pursuant to which we agreed to provide financing to oxatasmb of up to million million  of which million million was immediately advanced 
as we expand into other international markets  in addition to entering markets directly  we may enter through a franchisee or a reseller as we have in new zealand 
the success of such strategy will depend on a number of factors  including whether our franchisees and resellers have the experience and financial resources to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operating  promotional and capital intensive initiatives  and the potential impact on us if they experience operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values  particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited by local law or otherwise  or are costly to exercise 
difficulties of one or more of our international franchisee or reseller arrangements could result in losses stemming from related strategic investments  delay penetration into and or negatively affect our brand in certain international markets  and distract management and absorb product development resources 
page more consumers are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet and accessing new platforms to make search queries 
if we are unable to effectively reach consumers on the internet on behalf of our customers  our business could be adversely affected 
the number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers  including mobile phones and tablets has increased dramatically in the past few years 
mobile search advertising is growing very rapidly and may offer lower conversion rates for our customers  which if not offset by lower costs  may make search engine marketing less attractive for our customers 
in addition  the lower resolution  functionality  and memory associated with some alternative devices may alter consumers use of the internet  including of search engines and other websites where we publish advertisements on behalf of customers 
for example  search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms  which could affect our ability to deliver advertising results to our clients if we are unable to effectively reach consumers via those apps 
our new clublocal service represents our entry into a new market and  as such  subjects us to new risks 
we have recently launched a new consumer service  clublocal  through which we create a direct relationship with customers and provide home related services by engaging third party suppliers who perform the agreed services on our behalf 
expanding our clublocal service to new markets will require substantial financial resources and establishing the clublocal brand with consumers is likely to require a significant investment in marketing 
these increased costs may negatively impact our operating results and  if clublocal is unsuccessful  our financial condition 
our new clublocal service is different from our other products and services  which have primarily been digital advertising products 
a component of our clublocal service is a software service used by our third party suppliers to administer the services on our behalf 
any errors  defects  disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our third party suppliers businesses  which in turn would negatively affect our ability to offer the clublocal service 
in addition  it is possible that the introduction of clublocal will be viewed as competitive by the purchasers of our marketing services  which could adversely affect sales of our media products and services 
clublocal may be subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to service professionals  which include management of licensing  permitting and quality of our third party contractors 
we have have sought to establish processes and procedures to manage risk and seek consumer satisfaction with the services provided by our third party contractors 
if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services  we could suffer lost sales  fines and lawsuits  as well as damage to our reputation  which could adversely affect our business 
we may be liable to consumers for any damage we cause to their home or facility  belongings or property during the delivery of clublocal services  and we offer a clublocal buyer protection plan guaranteeing clublocal services for up to  in addition  if a clublocal consumer is injured in connection with a clublocal service  we could be exposed to personal injury or product liability claims 
any such claims we face could result in significant refunds or payments to consumers  or could be expensive to defend and divert management s attention 
also  any such claims and any adverse outcomes may subject us to adverse publicity  damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of clublocal services and our other products 
we are introducing new saas products  which may not gain market acceptance or may not perform as we intend 
we are developing and launching new saas products designed to provide smbs tools to convert leads to customers  retain customers  and transact with customers 
the success of our new saas products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  such as the difficulties of designing complex software products  integrating the new saas products with our existing technology  training our imcs to sell the new saas products  and gaining market acceptance 
because our saas products are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third party software  our saas products may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business 
internet based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found defects in our saas products and new errors in our saas products may be detected in the future 
in addition  our customers may use our saas products in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data 
if we acquire new technology  we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our saas products 
since our customers may use our saas products for important aspects of their business  such as scheduling  pricing  invoicing  calculation of sales taxes and transaction processing  any errors  defects  disruptions in service or other performance problems could damage our customers businesses and result in financial losses  which would hurt our reputation 
as a result  customers could elect to not renew  or delay or withhold payment to us  we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us 
page we depend on key personnel to operate our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers  as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  technical and finance personnel 
qualified individuals are in high demand  and we may incur significant costs to attract them 
all of our us officers and other us employees are at will employees  which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
if we are unable to attract and retain our executive officers and key employees  our business  operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
in addition  our management team has a long history of working together  and we believe that our key executives have developed highly successful and effective working relationships 
if one or more of these individuals leave  we may not be able to fully integrate new executives or replicate the current dynamic  and our operations could suffer 
volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees 
our executive officers have become vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options 
employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options  or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock 
during  we realigned the roles of some of our executive management team 
those changes may not prove effective or may be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the impact of worldwide economic conditions  including the resulting effect on advertising budgets  may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of advertising 
in addition  as we increase our international footprint  we will become more sensitive to economic conditions outside of north america 
we believe that the economic conditions remain challenging in north america and internationally  which have adversely affected our business 
to the extent that economic difficulties continue  or worldwide economic conditions materially deteriorate  our existing and potential clients may no longer consider investment in our online marketing solutions a necessity  or may elect to reduce advertising budgets 
historically  economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending 
in particular  online marketing advertising solutions may be viewed by some of our existing and potential clients as a lower priority and may be among the first expenditures reduced as a result of unfavorable economic conditions 
these developments could cause us to respond by temporarily reducing hiring or taking other measures and could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our financial results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
our foreign operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue  operating expenses and net income or loss 
if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  however  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenue  operating expenses and net income or loss 
as exchange rates vary  sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  approximately of our cash balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and the value of such holdings will increase or decrease along with the weakness or strength of the us dollar  respectively 
if we fail to increase the number of our clients or retain existing clients  our revenue and our business will be harmed 
our ability to grow our business depends in large part on maintaining and expanding our client base 
to do so  we must convince prospective clients of the benefits of our rl platform and existing clients of the continuing value of our products and services 
the online marketing industry is new and rapidly evolving  and many prospective clients may not be familiar with the benefits of online marketing 
these businesses may generally favor using more traditional methods of local advertising  such as newspapers or print yellow pages directories 
in addition  as the online media options for smbs proliferate and our clients become more familiar with such options  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding our client base 
page smb marketing and advertising campaigns are often sporadic and difficult to predict  as they may be driven by seasonal promotions or business dynamics  evolving product and service offerings  available budgets and other factors 
some smbs advertise only periodically  such as to promote sales or special offers 
because we need to address these business considerations of our clients  we do not require clients to enter into long term obligations to purchase our products and services 
many do not renew their campaigns  and some cancel 
we must continually add new clients both to replace clients who choose not to renew their advertising campaigns and to grow our business beyond our current client base 
a client s decision not to renew may be based on a number of factors  including dissatisfaction with our products and services  inability to continue operations and spending levels or because their campaigns were event driven or otherwise intentionally limited in scope or duration 
if our clients increasingly fail to fulfill their contracts or increasingly do not renew their advertising campaigns with us  or if we are unable to attract new clients in numbers greater than the number of clients that we lose  our client base will decrease and our business  financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated by our national brands  agencies and resellers 
if we are not able to maintain relationships with one or more of them  our sales may suffer and our revenue may decline 
we distribute our products and services through a separate sales force for national brands with operations in multiple local markets  as well as select third party agencies and resellers 
more generally  because national brands  agencies and resellers typically represent an aggregated group of smb clients  if our relationship with one or more of these persons or companies were restricted or terminated  our sales would decrease and our revenue would be adversely affected  potentially materially 
in addition  our strategy of distributing our products and services to our clients through our direct local channel and through our national brands  agencies and resellers channel may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct local sales efforts may compete with our third party agency and resellers and  to the extent different third party agencies and resellers target the same clients  they may also come into conflict with each other 
while we have certain policies in place to address these potential conflicts  there can be no assurance that these channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our relationship with existing third party agencies and resellers or adversely affect our ability to attract new third party agencies and resellers 
in the event that any of our relationships with existing third party agencies and resellers are terminated or we are unable to attract new third party agencies and resellers as a result of these distribution channel conflicts  our sales may suffer and our revenue may decline 
if smbs increasingly opt to perform advertising tasks on their own  their demand for our products and services would decrease  negatively affecting our revenue 
large internet marketing providers such as google  yahoo and microsoft offer online advertising products and services through self service platforms 
as smbs become more familiar with and experienced in interacting online  they may prefer to actively manage their own internet presence and their demand for our products and services may decrease 
we cannot predict the evolving experiences and preferences of smbs  which may become more fully integrated into digitized modes of commerce and communication  and cannot assure you that we can develop our products and services in a manner that will suit their needs and expectations faster or more effectively than our competitors  or at all 
if we are not able to do so  our results of operations would suffer 
we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis  which may make it difficult to predict our future performance 
our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
in addition to other risk factors discussed in this section  factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include unilateral actions taken by google or other media providers  seasonal variations in advertising budgets and media pricing  seasonal variations in imc hiring  the rate at which smbs migrate their advertising spending online  page the timing and stage of product and technology development  our ability to develop  introduce and manage consumer facing products  the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly the relative strength of the us dollar to the currencies in the countries in which we do business and its impact on our consolidated revenues and results of operations  the impact of worldwide economic conditions on our revenue and expenses  the timing of and our ability to enter new markets and manage expansion in new markets  our ability to appropriately set the price of non media products  our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses  the attraction and retention of qualified employees and key personnel  the effectiveness of our internal controls  our ability to effectively manage our growth  our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses  solutions or technologies  interruptions in service and any related impact on our reputation  the effects of natural or man made catastrophic events  and changes in government regulation affecting our business 
as a result of these and other factors  the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors 
growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure 
we have experienced substantial growth in our business 
this growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure 
as our operations grow in size  scope and complexity  we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of clients enhanced solutions  features and functionality 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our clients  develop and improve our operational  financial and management controls  enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit  train and retain highly skilled personnel 
managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources 
if we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency in our organization as it grows  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
our ability to deliver reporting and tracking solutions to our clients depends upon the quality  availability  policies and prices of third party call tracking providers  website hosting companies and domain registrars 
we rely on third parties to provide our call tracking and recording services 
in certain geographies  we rely on a single call tracking provider 
in the event the provider were to terminate our relationship or stop providing these services  our ability to provide our tracking services could be impaired 
we may not be able to find an alternative provider in time to avoid a disruption of our services or at all  and we cannot be certain that such provider s services would be compatible with our products without significant modifications or cost  if at all 
our proxy servers  which underlie key elements of our tracking services  require the use of various domains and ip address blocks 
if domain registrars  website hosting companies or internet service providers determined that our use of such domains and ip blocks were in violation of their terms of service or internet policies  such companies could elect to block our traffic 
for example  several website hosting companies have blocked traffic from our reverse proxy servers for a group of our smb clients  resulting in our inability to provide our full tracking services to those clients 
our ability to address or mitigate these risks may be limited 
the failure of all or part of our tracking services could result in a loss of clients and associated revenue and could harm our results of operations 
page we rely on bandwidth providers  data centers and other third parties for key aspects of the process of providing online marketing solutions to our clients  and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties could harm our ability to operate our business and damage our reputation 
we rely on third party vendors  including data center  software as a service  cloud computing internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers 
any disruption in the services provided by these third party providers or any failure of these third party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business 
any financial or other difficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business  the nature and extent of which we cannot predict 
we exercise little control over these third party vendors  which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements 
any errors  failures  interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third party technologies and information services could negatively impact our relationship with our clients and adversely affect our brand and our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties 
client complaints or negative publicity about our customer service or other business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand 
client complaints or negative publicity about our technology  personnel or customer service could severely diminish confidence in and the use of our products and services 
effective customer service requires significant personnel expense  and this expense  if not managed properly  could significantly impact our operating results 
moreover  failure to provide our clients with high quality customer experiences for any reason could substantially harm our reputation and our brand and adversely affect our efforts to develop as a trusted provider of online marketing and reporting solutions for the smb market 
rapid technological changes may render our online marketing and reporting solutions obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our solutions to our clients 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our rl platform 
the internet  access to the internet and the online marketing and advertising industry are rapidly changing 
our competitors are constantly developing new products and services in online marketing and advertising 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that clients can easily and effectively use 
if competitors introduce new solutions embodying new technologies  or if new industry practices emerge  our existing technology may become obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing solutions  develop new solutions and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective clients  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
developing our online marketing and reporting solutions and the underlying technology entail significant technical and business risks 
we may use new technologies ineffectively  or we may fail to adapt our rl platform and network infrastructure to client requirements or emerging industry practices 
if we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced solutions  our clients may forego the use of our solutions in favor of those of our competitors 
future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to expand our offerings and markets and grow our business in response to changing technologies  client demands and competitive pressures 
in some circumstances  such as our recent acquisition of the assets of realpractice  inc  we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses  solutions or technologies rather than through internal development 
the identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult  time consuming and costly  and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions 
furthermore  even if we successfully complete an acquisition  we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business  technologies  solutions  personnel or operations of the company that we acquired  particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us 
we may also inherit liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including violations of laws  rules and regulations  intellectual property disputes  commercial disputes  tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities 
in addition  we may borrow to complete an acquisition  which would increase our costs  or issue equity securities  which would dilute our stockholders ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
historically  we have primarily grown organically  rather than through acquisitions 
as a result  we have somewhat limited experience in identifying and executing acquisition opportunities 
acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience 
consequently  we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions which could harm our operating results 
page we make strategic investments from time to time and if they are unsuccessful  it could harm our financial condition 
we have made strategic investments in the past  such as the market development loan to oxatasmb  a franchisee  and may make additional similar or different strategic investments in the future 
such investments may not prove profitable or successful for us and may result in the partial or total loss of our invested capital 
in addition  strategic investments  such as with oxatasmb  may involve future commitments to provide further capital and we cannot assure you any such further investments will be desirable if  and when made  or will prove profitable over the long term 
we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities  challenges  acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances 
if capital is not available to us  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
we may require additional capital to operate or expand our business 
in addition  some of our product development initiatives may require substantial additional capital resources before they begin to generate material revenue 
additional funds may not be available when we need them  on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
if we do not have funds available to enhance our solutions  maintain the competitiveness of our technology or pursue business opportunities  we may not be able to service our existing clients or acquire new clients  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes  fires  floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  fires  floods  power losses  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks  acts of war  human errors  break ins and similar events 
for example  a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  fire or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition  and our insurance coverage will likely be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 
our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential intellectual property or client data 
we may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances  such as natural disasters affecting the los angeles area  and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur 
as we rely heavily on our servers  computer and communications systems and the internet to conduct our business and provide high quality customer service  such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business  which could have an adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data  our service may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our service 
our service involves the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information  such as credit card and bank account numbers  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes  including unauthorized use of credit cards  debit cards or bank account information  identity theft or merchant fraud 
if our security measures are breached in the future as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise  and as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to our clients data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients 
page we are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments we accept 
if we fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations  we may incur additional fees  fines and ultimately  the revocation of the right to use the credit card company  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a majority of our clients campaigns were paid for using a credit card or debit card 
for credit and debit card payments  we pay interchange and other fees  which may increase over time and raise our operating expenses and adversely affect our net income 
we are also subject to payment card association operating rules  certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers  which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply 
we believe we are compliant with the payment card industry data security standard  which incorporates visa s cardholder information security program and mastercard s site data protection standard 
however  there is no guarantee that we will maintain such compliance or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment system 
if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements  we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our clients 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would result in significantly higher credit card related costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to charge sales tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales to customers located in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax 
we generally do not charge  collect or have imposed upon us sales or other transaction taxes related to the products and services we sell  except for certain corporate level taxes and transaction level taxes outside of the united states 
however  many states  local jurisdictions or one or more countries may seek to impose sales or other transaction tax obligations on us in the future 
a successful assertion by any state  local jurisdiction or country in which we do business that we should be collecting sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales  create increased administrative burdens or costs  discourage clients from purchasing products or services from us  decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations 
the imposition of new laws requiring the collection of sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services or the introduction of new products or services that are subject to existing transaction taxes could create increased administrative burdens or costs  discourage clients from purchasing products or services from us  decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations 
the intended tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business 
our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements  including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions  are intended to reduce our worldwide effective tax rate 
the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions  including the united states  to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 
the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements  including our transfer pricing  or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences  which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 
our corporate structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 
our intercompany arrangements allocate income to such entities in accordance with arm s length principles and commensurate with functions performed  risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets 
we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the us statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
for example  our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions  the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions 
it is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views  for instance  with respect to  among other things  the manner in which the arm s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes  or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property 
in addition  tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied 
in particular  there is uncertainty in relation to the us tax legislation in terms of the future corporate tax rate but also in terms of the us tax consequences of income derived from intellectual property related income earned overseas in low tax jurisdictions 
page our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws 
however  the tax benefits which we intend to eventually derive could be undermined if we are unable to adapt the manner in which we operate our business and due to changing tax laws 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results 
because our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property  including our proprietary technology  the protection of our intellectual property rights is crucial to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including trade secrets  patent applications  copyrights and trademarks  as well as contractual restrictions  to safeguard our intellectual property 
these afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our online marketing and reporting solutions  technology  software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary 
moreover  policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective 
in particular  because we sell our solutions internationally  we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our proprietary technology is not currently protected by any issued patents  and policing our rights to such technology may be hindered if we are unable to obtain any patents 
in addition  the type and extent of patent claims that may be issued to us in the future is uncertain  and any patents that are issued may not contain claims that permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology 
in light of the costs of obtaining patent protection  at times we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later on prove to be highly important 
to the extent that the various technologies underlying any patent applications are determined to be business methods  the law around these types of patents is rapidly developing  and pending changes may impact our ability to protect our technology and proprietary use thereof through patents 
we have registered reachlocal and other trademarks as trademarks in the united states and in certain other countries 
some of our trade names are not eligible to receive trademark protection 
also  trademark protection may not be available  or sought by us  in every country in which our technology and products are available online 
competitors may adopt service names similar to ours  or purchase our trademarks and confusingly similar terms as keywords in internet search engine advertising programs  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to client confusion 
in addition  there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term reachlocal or our other trademarks 
litigation or proceedings before the us patent and trademark office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the united states and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our patent rights  trade secrets and domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our operating results 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees  licensees  independent contractors and other advisors 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such cases  we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
page assertions by third parties of infringement by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results 
companies in the internet  technology and media industries own large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and frequently litigate or threaten litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
other parties have asserted  and may in the future assert  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
these types of litigations may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue  and therefore our own issued and pending patents  if any  may provide little or no deterrence 
in addition  we have been and could in the future become involved in disputes over the use of keywords by our clients  to the extent such clients competitors allege the use of such keywords on our rl platform violates such competitors trademark rights 
we cannot predict whether assertions of third party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results 
if we are forced to defend against any infringement claims  whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor  we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel 
furthermore  an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages  potentially including treble damages and attorneys fees  if we are found to have willfully infringed a party s patent or copyright rights  cease making  licensing or using solutions that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others  expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions  and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
over time  we expect that we will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows or as our presence and visibility within the industry increases 
we could lose clients if we or our media partners fail to detect click through or other fraud on advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to our clients 
we are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks or actions on our third party publishers websites 
we may lose clients  or in the future  we may have to refund revenue that our clients have paid to us and that was later attributed to  or suspected to be caused by  click through fraud 
click through fraud occurs when an individual clicks on an ad displayed on a website or an automated system is used to create such clicks with little to no intent of viewing the underlying content 
if fraudulent clicks are not detected  the affected clients may become dissatisfied with our campaigns  which in turn may lead to loss of clients and the related revenue 
our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy  data protection  and other matters 
many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation  and could result in claims  changes to our business practices  increased cost of operations  or otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business  including user privacy  rights of publicity  data protection  content  intellectual property  distribution  electronic contracts and other communications  competition  protection of minors  consumer protection  taxation  and online payment services 
foreign data protection  privacy  and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the united states 
these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change 
in addition  the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain 
these laws and regulations could have a significant impact on online advertising services depending on how these laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced 
it is also clear that the laws and regulations are intending to regulate behavioral targeting  the availability of which could become highly limited are eliminated entirely 
our product suite does not rely heavily on the use of behavioral targeting  but we do offer a display remarketing product  which involves showing a consumer an ad for the website of an advertiser that the consumer has previously visited 
in addition  a number of proposals are pending before federal  state  and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business 
for example  a revision to the european union data protection directive is currently being considered by european legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for data processors and significant penalties for non compliance 
similarly  there have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the united states  at both the federal and state level  that would impose new obligations in areas such as privacy  data protection and data breach notifications 
some of the proposed changes to us and european law could require that we obtain prior consent before using cookies or other tracking technologies or provide a do not track mechanism in certain circumstances 
these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products  result in negative publicity  increase our operating costs  require significant management time and attention  and subject us to claims or other remedies  including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices 
we process  store and use personal information and other data  which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy 
our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 
we receive  store and process personal information and other user data  including credit card information for certain users 
there are numerous federal  state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing  sharing  use  processing  disclosure and protection of personal information and other user data  the scope of which are changing  subject to differing interpretations  and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules 
it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices 
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies  our privacy related obligations to users or other third parties  or our privacy related legal obligations  or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data  may result in governmental enforcement actions  litigation or negative publicity and could cause our advertisers to lose trust in us  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  if third parties with whom we work  such as our publishers or our providers of telephony services  violate applicable laws or our policies  such violations may also put our users information at risk and could have an adverse effect on our business 
page some of our services may utilize open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
some of our services may utilize software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  including  but not limited to  the gnu general public license and the gnu lesser general public license 
some of those licenses may require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create using the open source software  that we provide notices with our products and that we license any modifications or derivative works under an open source license or rights of further use to third parties 
if we combine our proprietary software with open source software  we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
although we take steps to ensure that our software engineers properly isolate our proprietary software they design from open source software components  we may not control the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not inappropriately incorporated open source software into our proprietary technologies 
if an author or other third party that distributes open source software were to obtain a judgment against us based on allegations that we had not complied with the terms of any applicable open source license  we could be subject to liability for copyright infringement damages and breach of contract 
in addition  we could be enjoined from selling our services that contained the open source software and required to make the source code for the open source software available  to grant third parties certain rights of further use of our software or to remove the open source software from our services  which could disrupt our distribution and sale of some of our services 
government regulation of the internet is evolving  and unfavorable changes could substantially harm our business and operating results 
we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth in use of the internet and online services 
the application of existing laws to the internet and online services governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy has not yet been settled 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may substantially harm our business and operating results 
other laws and regulations that have been adopted  or may be adopted in the future  that may affect our business include those covering user privacy  data protection  spyware  do not email lists  access to high speed and broadband service  pricing  taxation  tariffs  patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  export of encryption technology  electronic contracting  click fraud  acceptable content  search terms  lead generation  behavioral targeting  consumer protection  and quality of products and services 
any changes in regulations or laws that hinder growth of the internet generally or that decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium could adversely affect our business

shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in may  at a price of per share  and our common stock has subsequently traded as high as and as low as 
an active  liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained  which could depress the trading price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies  the overall performance of the equity markets  the number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading  changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases  page threatened or actual litigation  changes in laws or regulations relating to our solutions  any major change in our board of directors or management  publication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts  large volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders  and general political and economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for internet related companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in very substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources and harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the recent distress in the financial markets has also resulted in extreme volatility in security prices 
future sales of shares of our common stock by stockholders could depress the price of our common stock 
as of december   approximately of our common stock is held by our directors  officers and entities affiliated with our directors  including approximately beneficially owned by vantagepoint capital partners and approximately beneficially owned by rho ventures 
in addition  these percentages may increase as we repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our million share repurchase program  of which approximately million was available for repurchase as of march  see part ii  item  common stock repurchases 
such shares have not been subject to lock up agreements since november vantagepoint and rho ventures were our two primary venture capital investors and have owned their shares for a considerable length of time

during august and november of  rho ventures sold an aggregate of  shares 
a number of members of our management team have adopted b trading plans covering approximately million shares of common stock as of december  in addition  insiders may seek to sell shares without the adoption of trading plans 
if there are substantial sales of our common stock in the public market  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
in addition  as of december   approximately million shares subject to outstanding options under our stock plan and our amended and restated stock incentive plan  are eligible for sale in the public market in the future  subject to certain legal and contractual limitations 
if these additional shares are sold  or if it is perceived that they will be sold  in the public market  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
our management continues to have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we received in our initial public offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment 
our management generally has broad discretion to use the net proceeds from our initial public offering  and our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds 
we have used and will continue to use the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses  solutions and technologies that we believe are complementary to our own 
if we do not invest or apply the net proceeds from the offering in ways that enhance stockholder value  we may fail to achieve expected financial results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
page investment funds managed by vantagepoint capital partners own a substantial amount of our stock and have significant influence over our business 
in the aggregate  insiders own a majority of our outstanding stock 
as of december   vantagepoint capital partners  one of our early venture capital investors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  vantagepoint has significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors 
vantagepoint s significant ownership also could affect the market price of our common stock by  for example  delaying  deferring or preventing a change in corporate control  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us  or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
alan salzman  the chief executive officer of vantage point  serves as a member of our board of directors 
as of december   our current directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock including all shares issuable with respect to options held by such holders 
certain provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors  including  among other things a classified board of directors with three year staggered terms  which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors  no cumulative voting in the election of directors  which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates  the ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares  including preferences and voting rights  without stockholder approval  which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer  the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation  death or removal of a director  which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders  the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors  the chief executive officer  the president in absence of a chief executive officer or our board of directors  which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action  including the removal of directors  the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock  voting together as a single class  to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws  which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition  the ability of our board of directors  by majority vote  to amend the bylaws  which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending the bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition  and advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us

active advertisers is a number we calculate to approximate the number of clients directly served through our direct local channel as well as clients served through our national brands  agencies and resellers channel 
we calculate active advertisers by adjusting the number of active campaigns to combine clients with more than one active campaign as a single active advertiser 
clients with more than one location are generally reflected as multiple active advertisers 
because this number includes clients served through the national brands  agencies and resellers channel  active advertisers includes entities with which we do not have a direct client relationship 
numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred 
active campaigns is a number we calculate to approximate the number of individual products or services we are managing under contract for active advertisers 
for example  if we were performing both reachsearch and reachdisplay campaigns for a client  we consider that two active campaigns 
similarly  if a client purchased reachsearch campaigns for two different products or purposes  we consider that two active campaigns 
numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred

overview our mission is to help small and medium sized businesses  or smbs  acquire  transact with  maintain and retain customers via the internet 
we offer a comprehensive suite of online marketing and reporting solutions  including reachsearch search engine marketing  reachcast web presence  reachdisplay display advertising  reachretargeting display retargeting  online marketing analytics  and other related products and solutions  each targeted to the smb market 
in  we expect to expand our product suite to include reachsite website solution and two software as a service  or saas  products reachconvert marketing automation and lead conversion and reachcommerce supporting online booking  transaction and back office processes 
we deliver these solutions to smbs through a combination of our proprietary platform  the rl platform  and our direct  feet on the street sales force of internet marketing consultants  or imcs  and select third party agencies  resellers and a franchisee 
we use our rl platform to create advertising campaigns for smbs to target potential customers in their geographic area  optimize those campaigns in real time and track tangible results 
through a single internet advertising budget  we enable our clients to reach local customers whether using traditional computing devices or mobile devices across the internet  including through all of the major search engines and leading general interest and vertically focused online publishers 
in  we expanded the rl platform to include reachcast  our full service web presence and social media solution  and in september  we launched reachretargeting  a reachdisplay product targeting local consumers who have recently searched for an smb s business keywords as well as those who have recently visited their website 
we continue to expand the rl platform to include additional advertising products designed specifically for the needs of our smb clients 
empowered by the rl platform  our imcs  which are based in or near the cities in which our clients operate  establish a direct consultative relationship with our clients and provide our solutions to achieve their marketing objectives 
we generate revenue by providing online advertising solutions for our clients through our portfolio of online marketing and advertising solutions 
we sell reachsearch  reachdisplay and reachretargeting based on a package pricing model in which our clients commit to a fixed fee that includes the media  the optimization  reporting and tracking technologies of the rl platform  and the personnel dedicated to support and manage their campaigns 
we also generate revenue from digital marketing solutions for our clients that do not include the purchase of third party media  including reachcast  totaltrack and totallivechat 
generally  our products are sold to our clients in a single budget to simplify the purchasing process 
we offer our products and services through two primary channels 
our imcs sell our products and services directly to smbs  which we refer to as our direct local channel 
we also sell our products and services through third party agencies and resellers  and to national or regional businesses with multiple locations  such as franchisors  which we refer to as national brands 
because the sale to agencies  resellers and national brands involves negotiations with businesses that generally represent an aggregated group of smb advertisers  we group them together as our national brands  agencies and resellers channel 
in  we entered our first market outside of north america through a joint venture in australia  and in  we acquired the remaining interest in the joint venture 
we entered the united kingdom and canada in  germany and the netherlands in  and japan and brazil in we also serve clients in new zealand  slovakia  poland and czech republic through our resellers  including a franchisee 
in  we commenced campaign management and provisioning operations in india 
business model our direct local channel represents the majority of our revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  direct local revenue has increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  growth in direct local revenue is largely attributable to an increase in the number of upperclassmen and the productivity of upperclassmen driven by their increased tenure 
also contributing to the increase was growth in the number of international imcs who  on average  are more productive than our imcs in north america 
page typically  each month we hire imcs worldwide  with the hiring weighted towards the first ten months of the year 
we refer to imcs with months or less of experience as underclassmen 
with each new class of underclassmen  we track how they are performing relative to a standard level of revenue growth and other performance metrics for each month after their training 
understanding the performance of past and current underclassmen allows us to adjust our investment in additional underclassmen in the event we detect significant changes in their productivity 
we believe the key factors that affect the productivity of our imcs are imc tenure 
as imcs mature  they  on average  grow their advertiser base or sell additional products to existing advertisers  resulting in greater revenue productivity 
in particular  upperclassmen  those imcs with more than months of employment  are more productive than underclassmen 
as more and more imcs mature and become upperclassmen  as upperclassmen become a higher percent of total imcs  and as existing upperclassmen mature  we expect overall imc productivity to increase 
macroeconomic and business conditions 
macroeconomic conditions directly impact the amount of money smbs allocate to market their business 
commencing in mid  imc productivity was significantly impacted by the economic recession as some of our smb clients were forced to close or temporarily suspend their operations  while others curtailed their marketing expenditures in light of a contraction in consumer spending 
from the end of through  our imc productivity remained higher than those levels experienced at the end of however  we believe the economic conditions remain challenging  particularly in north america 
in addition  our imcs productivity is affected by the amount of competition and online advertising consumption by smbs 
for example  our international imcs have on average been more productive  which we attribute to lower levels of competition and online advertising consumption by smbs in those markets 
number of products 
we believe that expanding our comprehensive suite of online marketing and reporting products and services will allow us to generate more revenue from each smb relationship 
prior to  we primarily offered a single product  reachsearch 
since then  we launched our reachdisplay and remarketing products in  our totallivechat and reachcast products in  our search retargeting and international reachcast products in  and our reachretargeting product in imc capacity 
we continually endeavor to enhance the productivity of our imcs 
our business model therefore contemplates additional investments in technology and support personnel to assist our imcs in managing and maintaining existing clients in order to increase their capacity to acquire new clients 
for example  we are in the process of organizing our sales and service organization into verticals so that we can leverage greater subject matter expertise  we continue to explore different staffing approaches to enhance the imc s opportunity to focus on new client acquisition  and we are deploying additional technology to make the selling process more efficient 
client tenure 
one of the most time consuming activities for our imcs is the process of prospecting  arranging a time to visit and obtaining the first order for our products and services from a new client 
a key factor in imc productivity is therefore the success of our efforts to continue to sell our products and services to existing clients  which requires significantly less of an imc s time 
we believe that a measure of the success of these efforts is the percentage of our revenue generated by sales to clients with different tenures 
for this purpose  on an annual basis  we divide our clients into three groups to measure their revenue contribution trial period clients 
we characterize a client s initial four months as the trial period because that is generally the minimum term for a new client s first agreement  and we believe that four months is the shortest period in which performance of an advertising campaign can be fully assessed 
first year post trial clients 
we characterize a client that continues to advertise through us after its four month trial period and for up to one year after its trial period as a first year post trial client 
long term clients 
we characterize clients that continue to advertise through us for more than one year after their trial period as long term clients 
page the chart below presents the percentage of total revenues represented by our trial period  first year post trial  and long term clients for the years ended december  to operating metrics we regularly review a number of other financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business  determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies 
the following table shows certain key operating metrics for the three years ended december   and december  number of imcs at period end upperclassmen underclassmen total underclassmen expense for the year ended in thousands active advertisers at period end active campaigns at period end see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures for our definition of underclassmen expense 
see part ii  item  selected financial data for our definition of active advertisers 
see part ii  item  selected financial data for our definition of active campaigns 
page number of imcs our ongoing investment in increasing the number of our imcs has been the principal engine for our growth 
typically  each month  we hire imcs worldwide  with the hiring weighted towards the first ten months of the year 
we refer to imcs with months or less of experience as underclassmen 
in particular  our revenue growth is driven by the increase in the number of our upperclassmen  who are significantly more productive than our underclassmen 
as such  we believe that our ability to grow our business is highly dependent on our ability to grow the number of our upperclassmen 
beyond our hiring practices  which determine the number of imcs to be hired as well as the rate at which we hire them  the increase in the number of upperclassmen depends primarily on the productivity of underclassmen  as the majority of underclassmen attrition has been involuntary and is based on performance relative to a standard level of revenue growth and other performance metrics determined by us 
we do not expect all underclassmen to become upperclassmen  and our investment decisions anticipate the cost of attrition 
our revenue growth is also driven by the increase in the number of our international imcs as our international imcs are on average more productive than our imcs in north america  which we attribute to lower levels of competition and lower existing online advertising consumption by smbs in those markets 
total imcs in increased as compared to the preceding year due to the increase in the number of underclassmen becoming upperclassmen 
the number of underclassmen at the end of was slightly lower than at the end of due to slightly lower imc hiring rates in during  our strategy regarding hiring and maturation of imcs was to maintain a more constant level of imc hiring globally as opposed to prior years when we sought to increase our number of underclassmen more substantially while shifting the hiring to our newer international markets and focusing on improving upperclassmen productivity in our more established markets 
underclassmen expense underclassmen do not  in the aggregate  make a positive contribution to operating income 
our largest operating expenses include the hiring  training and retention of underclassmen in support of our goal of developing more upperclassmen 
underclassmen expense is a number we calculate to approximate our investment in underclassmen and is comprised of the selling and marketing expenses we allocate to underclassmen during a reporting period 
the amount includes the direct salaries and allocated benefits of the underclassmen excluding commissions and other variable compensation  training and sales organization expenses  including depreciation  allocated based on relative headcount and marketing expenses allocated based on relative revenue 
while we believe that underclassmen expense provides useful information regarding our approximate investment in underclassmen  the methodology we use to arrive at our estimated underclassmen expense was developed internally by management  is not a concept or method recognized by gaap and other companies may use different methodologies to calculate or approximate measures similar to underclassmen expense 
accordingly  our calculation of underclassmen expense may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
we determine the amount to invest in underclassmen based on our objectives for development of the business and the key factors affecting imc productivity described above 
the increase in underclassmen expense in as compared to the preceding year was primarily attributable to our international expansion  partially offset by a reduced investment in north america 
underclassmen expense slightly increased as compared to the preceding year due to increased hiring in our international markets  though the increase was offset by a reduced investment in underclassmen recruitment in north america 
the increase in underclassmen expense from to was lower than the increase from to as a result of our strategy to maintain a more constant level of imc hiring globally as opposed to prior years when we sought to increase underclassmen hiring more substantially while shifting the hiring to our newer international markets and focusing on improving upperclassmen productivity in our more established markets 
active advertisers and active campaigns we track the number of active advertisers and active campaigns to evaluate the growth  scale and diversification of our business 
we also use these metrics to determine the needs and capacity of our sales forces  our support organization and other personnel and resources 
active advertisers and active campaigns increased in due to an increase in the number of upperclassmen and the productivity of upperclassmen driven by their increased tenure  and an increase in the number of products available for our imcs to sell 
basis of presentation discontinued operations as a result of the winding down of the operations of bizzy  we have reclassified and presented all related historical financial information as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition  we have excluded all bizzy related activities from the following discussions  unless specifically referenced 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from the provision and sale of online advertising to our clients 
revenue includes i the sale of our reachsearch  reachdisplay  reachretargeting and other products based on a package pricing model in which our clients commit to a fixed fee that includes the media  optimization  reporting and tracking technologies of the rl platform  and the personnel dedicated to support and manage their campaigns  ii the sale of our reachcast  totaltrack  totallivechat  and other products and services  and iii set up  management and service fees associated with these products and other services 
we distribute our products and services directly through our sales force of imcs  who are focused on serving smbs in their local markets through an in person  consultative process  which we refer to as our direct local channel  as well as a separate sales force targeting our national brands  agencies and resellers channel 
the sales cycle for sales to smbs ranges from one day to over a month 
sales to our national brands  agencies and resellers clients generally require several months 
page we typically enter into multi month agreements for the delivery of our reachsearch  reachdisplay  reachretargeting and reachcast products 
under our agreements  our smb clients typically pay  in advance  a fixed fee on a monthly basis  which includes all charges for the included technology and media services  management  third party content and other costs and fees 
we record these prepayments as deferred revenue and only record revenue for income statement purposes as we purchase media and perform other services on behalf of clients 
generally  when at least of requisite purchases and other services have occurred and an additional campaign cycle remains under the agreement  we make an additional billing or automatic collection for the next campaign cycle 
our national brands  agencies and resellers clients enter into agreements of various lengths or that are indefinite 
our national brands  agencies and resellers clients either pay in advance or are extended credit privileges with payment generally due in to days 
there were million and million of accounts receivables related to our national brands  agencies and resellers at december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third party publishers 
media cost is classified as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized 
from time to time  publishers offer the company rebates based upon various factors and operating rules  including the amount of media purchased 
we record these rebates in the period in which they are earned as a reduction to cost of revenue and the corresponding payable to the applicable publisher  or as an other receivable  as appropriate 
cost of revenue also includes third party telephone and information services costs  data center and third party hosting costs  credit card processing fees  third party content and other direct costs 
cost of revenue also includes the cost of service providers related to our clublocal service 
in addition  cost of revenue includes costs to initiate  operate and manage clients campaigns  other than costs associated with the company s sales force  which are reflected as selling and marketing expenses 
cost of revenue includes salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation for the related staff  including the cost of web presence professionals who are the principal service providers for the company s reachcast product  and allocated overhead such as depreciation expense  rent and utilities  as well as an allocable portion of our technical operations costs 
cost of revenue also includes the amortization and impairment charges on certain acquired intangible assets 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our selling and marketing staff  including salaries and wages  commissions and other variable compensation  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  travel and business costs  training  recruitment  marketing and promotional events  advertising  other brand building and product marketing expenses  and occupancy  technology and other direct overhead costs 
a portion of the compensation for imcs  sales management and other employees in the sales organization is based on commissions and other variable compensation 
in addition  the cost of agency commissions is included in selling and marketing expenses 
product and technology 
product and technology expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our product development and technology staff  including salaries  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  and the cost of certain third party service providers and other expenses  including occupancy  technology and other direct overhead costs 
technology operations costs  including related personnel and third party costs  are included in product and technology expenses 
we capitalize a portion of costs for software development and  accordingly  include amortization of those costs as product and technology expenses as the rl platform addresses all aspects of our activities  including supporting the imc selling and consultation process  online publisher integration  efficiencies and optimization  providing insight to our clients into the results and effects of their online advertising campaigns and supporting all of the financial and other back office functions of our business 
product and technology expenses also include the amortization of the technology obtained in acquisitions and expenses of the deferred payment obligations related to acquisitions attributable to product and technology personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for executive  legal  finance  human resources and corporate communications  including wages  benefits  bonuses and stock based compensation  professional fees  insurance premiums and other expenses  including occupancy  technology and other direct overhead  public company costs and other corporate expenses 
page critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software development costs goodwill long lived and intangible assets stock based compensation variable interest entities income taxes revenue recognition we recognize revenue for our services when all of the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been performed  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue as the cost for the third party media is incurred  which is upon delivery of the advertising on behalf of our clients 
we recognize revenue for our reachsearch product as clicks are recorded on sponsored links on the various search engines and for our reachdisplay and reachretargeting product when the display advertisements record impressions or as otherwise provided in our agreement with the applicable publisher 
we recognize revenue for our reachcast product on a straight line basis over the applicable service period for each campaign 
we recognize revenue when we charge set up  management service or other fees on a straight line basis over the term of the related campaign contract or the completion of any obligation for services  if shorter 
when we receive advance payments from clients  we record these amounts as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized 
when we extend credit  we record a receivable when the revenue is recognized 
when we sell through agencies  we either receive payment in advance of services or in some cases extend credit 
we pay each agency an agreed upon commission based on the revenue we earn or cash we receive 
some agency clients that have been extended credit may offset the amount otherwise due to us by any commissions they have earned 
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of campaign revenue or the net amount earned after commissions 
as we are the primary party obligated in the arrangement  subject to the credit risk  with discretion over both price and media  we recognize the gross amount of such sales as revenue and any commissions are recognized as a selling and marketing expense 
we also have a small number of resellers  including a franchisee 
resellers integrate our services  including reachsearch  reachdisplay and totaltrack  into their product offerings 
in most cases  the resellers integrate with our rl platform through a custom application programming interface api 
resellers are responsible for the price and specifications of the integrated product offered to their clients 
resellers pay us in arrears  net of commissions and other adjustments 
we recognize revenue generated under reseller agreements net of the agreed upon commissions and other adjustments earned or retained by the reseller  as we believe that the reseller has retained sufficient control and bears sufficient risks to be considered the primary obligor in those arrangements 
page we have recently launched a new consumer service  clublocal  through which we create a direct relationship with consumers and provide home related services by engaging third party suppliers who perform the agreed services on our behalf 
revenue is recognized when services have been provided 
as we are the primary obligor under the arrangements  have discretion in supplier selection  have latitude in establishing prices  and bear the credit risk  we recognize the gross amount of sales as revenue and the cost of the service provided is recorded as cost of revenue 
we offer future incentives to clients in exchange for minimum commitments 
in these circumstances  we estimate the amount of the future incentives that will be earned by clients and defer a portion of the otherwise recognizable revenue 
estimates are based upon a statistical analysis of previous campaigns for which such incentives were offered 
should a client not meet its minimum commitment and no longer qualify for the incentive  we recognize the revenue previously deferred related to the estimated incentive 
we account for sales and similar taxes imposed on our services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations 
software development costs we capitalize costs to develop software when we have determined that the development efforts will result in new or additional functionality or new products 
costs capitalized as internal use software are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated three year useful life 
costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria and costs associated with ongoing maintenance are expensed as incurred and are recorded along with amortization of capitalized software development costs as product and technology expenses within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we monitor our existing capitalized software and reduce its carrying value as the result of releases that render previous features or functions obsolete or otherwise reduce the value of previously capitalized costs 
goodwill we have total goodwill of million as of december  and million as of december  related to our acquired businesses 
we operate in one reportable segment  in accordance with asc  segment reporting  and have identified two reporting units north america and australia for purposes of evaluating goodwill 
these reporting units each constitute a business or group of businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by each segment s management 
north america s assigned goodwill was million as of december  and million as of december  australia s assigned goodwill was million as of december  and we review the carrying amounts of goodwill for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual assessment of goodwill impairment as of the first day of each fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   we followed the amended guidance for assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
entities are provided with the option of first performing a qualitative assessment on any of its reporting units to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary 
an entity may also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 
if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing a two step impairment test is necessary 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units with their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  including goodwill  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then the second step is performed to compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we estimate fair value utilizing the projected discounted cash flow method and discount rate determined by management to commensurate the risk inherent in our business model 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of and  and determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment of goodwill 
accordingly  no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december  and page long lived and intangible assets we report finite lived  acquisition related intangible assets at fair value  net of accumulated amortization 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of one or three years 
straight line amortization is used because no other pattern over which the economic benefits will be consumed can be reliably determined 
management reviews the carrying values of long lived assets  including intangible assets  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our analysis of other finite lived amortizable intangible assets  we apply the guidance of asc  intangibles goodwill and other  in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various developed technologies and client relationships of the businesses we have acquired 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation based on fair value 
we follow the attribution method  which reduces current stock based compensation expenses recorded by the effect of anticipated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience 
the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of the grant and amortized over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment  including estimating volatility  expected term and risk free interest rate 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent management s estimate based on judgment and subjective future expectations 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model significantly changes  stock based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously 
variable interest entities in accordance with asc  consolidations  the applicable accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities  or vies  we analyze our interests  including agreements  loans  guarantees  and equity investments  on a periodic basis to determine if such interests are variable interests 
if variable interests are identified  then the related entity is assessed to determine if it is a vie 
our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews 
we base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity  and our qualitative analysis on the design of the entity  its organizational structure including its decision making authority  and relevant agreements 
if we determine that the entity is a vie  we then assess if we must consolidate the vie as its primary beneficiary 
our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon qualitative and quantitative analyses  which assess the purpose and design of the vie  the nature of the vie s risks and the risks that we absorb  the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie  and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie 
in connection with our entrance into a franchise agreement with oxatasmb on july   we entered into a market development loan agreement with oxatasmb pursuant to which the company agreed to provide financing to oxatasmb of up to million million  of which million million has been advanced

deferred consideration deferred purchase consideration that is fixed and determinable and expected to be settled in cash is accrued as a liability as of the date of the respective acquisition 
deferred purchase consideration that is fixed and determinable and expected to be settled in common stock is recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as of the date of acquisition 
deferred stock based compensation issued to employees in connection with acquisitions is measured at fair value on the date of grant acquisition and recognized over the vesting period of the instruments in accordance with our stock based compensation policy 
common stock repurchase and retirement common stock repurchased is retired and the excess of the cost over the par value of the common shares repurchased is charged to additional paid in capital 
page income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
for the periods presented  income tax expense represents income taxes imposed by state  foreign and local tax jurisdictions applicable to our activities 
we are otherwise generating net operating losses in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we believe that it is likely that taxes imposed by state  local and foreign jurisdictions will increase in magnitude  particularly to the extent we become profitable in certain foreign jurisdictions before the time we obtain profitability on a consolidated basis 
due to a history of losses  we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the ability to utilize these losses  any future losses and any other tax credits or attributes may be restricted or eliminated by changes in our ownership  including potentially as a result of our public offering  changes in legislation and other rules affecting the ability to offset future taxable income with losses from prior periods 
future determinations on the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will be made on a quarterly basis  and our assessment at december  reflects a continued need for a valuation allowance 
us income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries in the amount of million that are essentially permanent in duration 
this amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiary 
determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on this temporary difference is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
as a result of the acquisition of smb live on february   we recorded a one time discrete deferred tax benefit of million from intangible assets recorded on the date of acquisition 
we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions 
such returns are  and from time to time  have been subject to audit by the various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities  which may disagree with our tax positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
we review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made

also contributing to the increase was growth in the number of international imcs who  on average  are more productive than our imcs in north america  which we attribute to lower levels of competition and growing online advertising demand by smbs in those markets 
total imcs in increased as compared to the preceding year due to the increase in the number of underclassmen becoming upperclassmen 
the number of underclassmen at the end of was slightly lower than at the end of due to slightly lower imc hiring rates in during  our strategy regarding hiring and maturation of imcs was to maintain a more constant level of imc hiring globally as opposed to prior years when we sought to increase underclassmen more substantially while shifting the hiring to our newer international markets and focusing on improving upperclassmen productivity in our more established markets

non gaap financial measures in addition to our gaap results discussed above  we believe adjusted ebitda and underclassmen expense are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance 
for the years ended december   and  our adjusted ebitda and underclassmen expense were as follows year ended december  non gaap financial measures unaudited in thousands adjusted ebitda underclassmen expense adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  stock based compensation  the effects of accounting for business combinations including any impairment of acquired intangibles and  in the case of the acquisition of smb live  the deferred cash consideration  and amounts included in other non operating income or expense 
underclassmen expense 
we define underclassmen expense as our investment in underclassmen  which is comprised of the selling and marketing expenses we allocate to underclassmen during a reporting period 
the amount includes the direct salaries and allocated benefits of the underclassmen excluding commissions and other variable compensation  training and sales organization expenses including depreciation allocated based on relative headcount and marketing expenses allocated based on relative revenue 
while we believe that underclassmen expense provides useful information regarding our approximated investment in underclassmen  the methodology we use to arrive at our estimated underclassmen expense was developed internally by the company  is not a concept or method recognized by gaap and other companies may use different methodologies to calculate or approximate measures similar to underclassmen expense 
accordingly  our calculation of underclassmen expense may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies 
our management uses adjusted ebitda because i it is a key basis upon which our management assesses our operating performance  ii it may be a factor in the evaluation of the performance of our management in determining compensation  iii we use it  in conjunction with gaap measures such as revenue and income loss from operations  for operational decision making purposes  and iv we believe it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating internet marketing companies 
page our management believes that adjusted ebitda permits an assessment of our operating performance  in addition to our performance based on our gaap results that is useful in assessing the progress of the business 
by excluding i the effects of accounting for business combinations and associated acquisition and integration costs  which obscure the measurable performance of the business operations  ii depreciation and amortization and other non operating income and expense  each of which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and iii stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  we believe that we are able to gain a fuller view of the operating performance of the business 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures and investments in underclassmen 
in addition  our management believes that adjusted ebitda and similar measures are widely used by investors  securities analysts  ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity based compensation to our management team and employees  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the potentially significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness we may incur in the future  adjusted ebitda does not reflect income and expense items that relate to our financing and investing activities  any of which could significantly affect our results of operations or be a significant use of cash  adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us  and other companies  including companies in our industry  calculate adjusted ebitda measures differently  which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace operating income loss  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
rather  adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance that you may consider in addition to those measures 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results  including cash flows provided by operating activities  and using total adjusted ebitda as a supplemental financial measure 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our loss from operations for each of the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands income loss from operations add stock based compensation  net depreciation and amortization acquisition and integration costs adjusted ebitda page liquidity and capital resources year ended december  consolidated statements of cash flow data in thousands net cash provided by operating activities  continuing operations net cash used in investing activities  continuing operations net cash used by discontinued operations net cash provided by used in financing activities at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
short term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities in excess of three months but less than months 
to date  we have experienced no loss of our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments 
we cannot  however  provide any assurances that access to our invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at december   we had no long term indebtedness for borrowed money and are not subject to any restrictive bank covenants 
at december   we had million in restricted certificates of deposit to secure letters of credit issued to landlords and others 
at december  and  we did not have contractual or purchase commitments for capital expenditures that were not reflected on our balance sheet as a liability 
in addition  at december   we had significant internal product and technology resources working on projects that met the criteria for capitalization as software development costs and others that did not  although none of the projects in process were long term projects greater than one year 
the amount capitalized for such projects in future periods will be evaluated by management and will impact the portion of costs for those internal resources that reduces net cash provided by operating activities and the portion of such costs used in investing activities 
funding for the committed capital expenditures  including software development costs  is expected to be provided by operating cash flows 
we have financed our operations  our expansion of our imc sales force and the extension of our direct local channel into new territories through cash provided by operations 
deferred revenue arising from prepayment by the great majority of our clients and vendor trade financing  principally for the purchase of media  are major components of our cash flow from operations  and the cash provided by deferred revenue and accounts payable has increased as our business has continued to grow 
in general  to the extent our revenue from our direct local channel continues to grow  we would expect both the amount of deferred revenue from customer prepayments and the amount of vendor financing for purchased media to increase  which  subject to offset from changes in other operating costs  cash demands or vendor terms  would result in an increase in net cash provided by operations 
should revenue from the direct local channel decrease  the amount of deferred revenue and vendor financing would likely decrease  which  subject to changes in other accounts  would cause net cash provided by operations to be reduced 
although we expect that cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances will be sufficient to continue funding our expansion activities  these investments  including investments in developing new products and services for our clients  could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing  and that financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  we intend to continue to increase our investment in underclassmen and in the development of new products and services for our clients  which could require significant capital and entail non capitalized expenses that could decrease our income from operations 
operating activities our cash flow from operating activities for resulted primarily from adjustments for non cash expenses and increases in operating liabilities

purchases may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions as determined by our management 
the amount and timing of the share repurchase will depend on business and market conditions  stock price  trading restrictions  acquisition activity  and other factors 
the share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock  and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks primarily include interest rate  foreign exchange and inflation risks 
interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term indebtedness for borrowed money 
our investments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments consist of cash  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our investments  revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the australian dollar  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the euro  the japanese yen  the indian rupee  and the brazilian real 
for the year ended december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies would have resulted in a decrease in revenue of million  but an increase in operating income of million 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies  however  would have resulted in an increase in revenue of million  but a decrease in operating income of million 
we currently do not hedge or otherwise manage our currency exposure 
as our international operations expand to more countries and mature  our risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates will become greater  and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk 
in addition  currency fluctuations or a weakening us dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
