table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk uranium price volatility the company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium 
we have two uranium supply contracts whose pricing mechanisms are based upon the market price of uranium 
future sales under these contracts would be impacted by both spot and long term uranium price fluctuations 
the company cash flow has historically been dependent on the price of uranium  which is determined primarily by global supply and demand  relative to the company costs of production 
historically  uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation  and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company control  including the demand for nuclear power  political and economic conditions  and governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies 
the spot market price for uranium has demonstrated a large range since january prices have risen from per pound at january to a high of per pound as of june the spot market price was per pound as of february
