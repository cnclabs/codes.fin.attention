liquidity and capital resources history and background we generally rely on cash from operations and equity and debt offerings  to the extent available  to satisfy our liquidity needs 
from february when our initial public offering occurred through the end of our fiscal  inclusive  we have raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our common stock 
in  the company implemented a cash conservation strategy by reducing its operating costs  which included restructuring its manufacturing operations 
our cash conservation strategy has also included measures such as extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers  delaying purchases for as long as practicable using just in time ordering practices and managing headcount and salaries for our staff to reflect order demand 
this business strategy has resulted in the fundamentals of the company improving each year 
fiscal was the first profitable year in the company s history 
in fiscal  we achieved positive cash flow from operations 
cash provided by operations was approximately  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the improvements in cash flows from operations are as a result of increased revenues from the additional markets we are able to address due to our lower cost structure as well as manufacturing and product efficiencies 
although we reported net income for fiscal we had recurring losses from operations in previous years 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our accumulated deficit was approximately million for fiscal year on september  we had a book cash balance of  management has developed an operating plan for fiscal and believes the company has adequate financial resources for achievement of this plan and to sustain its current operations in the coming year 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily from precision molded optics  with the emphasis on low cost  high volume applications  optical assemblies including our redesigned collimator product line and infrared products 
we expect further margin improvements based on production efficiencies and yield improvements 
we expect this continued growth in our precision molded optic lenses due to what we believe is the beginning of a multi year growth cycle of the optical market 
this multi year growth cycle is driven by four major trends cloud computing  video distribution via digital technology  wireless broadband  and machine to machine connection 
cloud computing is causing a shift in enterprise technology with increased spending for software as a service saas and infrastructure as a service iaas capital investments 
delivery of applications and technology using saas or iaas requires larger and faster network bandwidth 
the explosion of mobile devices  which includes smartphones and tablet devices  is also requiring the expansion of network bandwidth as users are receiving and transferring larger amounts of data via their mobile devices 
the number of mobile devices will exceed the global population by and is estimated to be a devices per person 
individuals are also streaming more video on their mobile devices or through their smart tvs 
this type of video distribution  which is estimated to be of all network traffic by  is creating a huge demand for larger and faster bandwidth 
finally  machine to machine connection technology allows wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same type 
this type of networking often requires bandwidth in order for the machines to communicate with each other 
all of these trends require the expansion of bandwidth  and thus  the growth of optical communication networks 
lightpath produces products  such as our precision molded optic lenses  that can be used as a component in optical communication networks 
these trends combined with the excellent value proposition that we bring to our customers with competitive prices and superior quality are the reasons we believe we are experiencing in increase in demand for our precision molded optic lenses and why we have confidence in our continued growth in the future 
we expect continued improvement of overhead absorption as we increase the volume of products produced and lower material costs since we will be able to purchase materials in higher volumes 
we also will continue to implement cost reductions with programs to improve tool life and lower anti reflective coating costs by coating the lenses at our facilities 
we have established milestones that will be tracked to ensure that as funds are being used that we are achieving results before additional funds are committed 
management will be monitoring the operating plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met  remedial actions will be initiated 
we continue to face financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with  as the slow recovery of the global economy continues to create instability in the market 
we continue efforts to keep costs under control as we seek renewed sales growth 
our efforts are directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability 
if these efforts are not successful  we will need to raise additional capital 
should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms  other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales 
these actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company  the sale of certain product lines  the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities  the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology  or other alternatives 
we execute all foreign sales from our orlando facility and inter company transactions in united states dollars  mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
assets and liabilities denominated in non united states currencies  primarily the chinese renminbi  are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date  and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year 
during the years ended june  and  we incurred a loss of  and a gain of  on foreign currency translation  respectively 
during fiscal we decided to no longer market our isolator product line and we reserved all isolator inventories at 
cash flows financings convertible debentures on march   the company and holders of our debentures holding approximately of the outstanding principal amount of the debentures executed the conversion agreement in connection with the early conversion of the debentures 
the debenture holder s party to the conversion agreement were steven brueck  j 
james gaynor  louis leeburg  robert ripp and gary silverman  all of whom are directors or officers of the company  and berg berg enterprises  llc bbe  a greater than beneficial stockholder of the company 
the conversion agreement provided  among other things  for the issuance of  shares of class a common stock as an incentive to convert the debentures into shares of common stock 
all of the holders party to the conversion agreement  except for bbe  fully converted their debentures 
in order to ensure bbe did not exceed a beneficial ownership limitation  it partially converted its debenture  and the company repaid  representing the outstanding principal amount due under its debenture 
the remaining holder not party to the conversion agreement was repaid  representing the outstanding principal amount due under its debenture 
as of june   none of the debentures remain outstanding 
private placement on june   we executed a securities purchase agreement the spa with institutional and other accredited investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of the company s class a common stock  at per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants had an initial exercise price of subsequently adjusted to  are exercisable for a period of five years beginning december   and contain customary  weighted average anti dilution protection with respect to the exercise price subject to a floor price of 
the company received gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the warrants in the amount of approximately  the company is required by the terms of the spa to use the funds for general working capital purposes to support the continued growth of the company s business  with the primary uses of the funds used for expansion of our infrared molding capacity and enhancement of our glass preparation processes and test and measurement capability 
the funding will also support new product development and the acquisition of new equipment  also critical to the company s growth plans 
the company paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  meyers associates  lp  in an amount equal to  plus a non accountable marketing and expense fee of  and reimbursement of up to  of its legal and due diligence expenses related to the private placement offering 
the company also issued the placement agent and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price equal to  subsequently adjusted to per share 
the warrants have a five year term and were exercisable after december  the private placement was exempt from the registration requirements of the act  pursuant to section a of the act in that the shares of common stock  warrants  and shares of common stock underlying the warrants were sold by the company in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
on june  we filed a registration statement to register the shares of common stock  warrants and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants 
the registration statement was declared effective on july  warrant exercises during july and august the company received  in proceeds from the exercise of warrants 
the company issued  shares of common stock in connection with these exercises 
the exercise prices ranged from to per share of common stock 
cash flows operating and investing cash flow provided by operations was approximately  for the year ended june   an increase of approximately  from fiscal our cash flow provided by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal our fiscal operating plan and related financial projections anticipate continued improvement in our cash flows in future years due to sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
for example  we expect lower glass costs as a result of replacing internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes and due to our ability to coat the lenses in house rather than out sourcing this service 
during fiscal  we expended approximately million for capital equipment as compared to  during fiscal the majority of our capital expenditures during both fiscal and fiscal were related to the purchase of equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and tooling for our precision molded products 
we anticipate increasing our expenditures during fiscal to enhance or expand our production capacity  however  the total amount expended will depend on opportunities and circumstances 
results of operations operating results for fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenue for fiscal totaled million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase was primarily attributable to revenue from precision molded lenses for the telecommunications and laser tool markets and custom optics 
the number of units of precision molded optics sold increased by due to the company s increased production capability and the pursuit of the low cost  high volume lens business 
we expect continued growth in sales to be derived primarily from our precision molded optics product line  particularly our low cost lenses sold in asia  and the company s infrared and collimator product lines 
gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared to in fiscal total manufacturing costs of million were approximately  lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease in manufacturing costs resulted from an increase in direct costs of  for materials  labor and outside services due to higher revenues offset by a decrease of  in labor costs  a decrease of  in tooling costs  a decrease of  in freight costs and a decrease of  in supplies 
direct costs  which include material  labor and services  were of revenue in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal we plan to continue emphasizing unit cost reductions by efficiently purchasing raw materials and increasing sourcing of coating services in china 
we also continue to have improvements in productivity due to a more experienced workforce at lpoi s shanghai facility and press efficiencies due to higher unit volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is due to  in higher wages and benefits   in higher legal fees   in higher fees for consulting services for it support   in higher fees for investor relations  offset by lower depreciation of  and the write off of  in expenses in fiscal related to our withdrawn shelf offering in fiscal our operating plan for fiscal projects an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due a projected higher level of sales 
we plan to manage our workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal decreased by approximately  to  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in wages and materials purchased for projects as our staff continued to work on the purchase order for raytheon vision systems raytheon 
our operating plan for fiscal projects an increase in product development spending due to enhanced efforts in the development of the infrared product line 
in fiscal  our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately  and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal interest expense was approximately  for fiscal as compared to approximately  for fiscal the debentures accounted for all of the interest expense during fiscal and this represented periodic interest of per annum  amortization and the write off of the debt issuance costs and debt discount 
in fiscal and  we recognized a  loss and a  gain  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of derivative warrants issued in our june private placement 
this fair value will be re measured each reporting period throughout the five year life of the warrants  or until exercised 
investment and other income increased by approximately  to  in fiscal primarily from a  in royalty income 
net income for fiscal was approximately  compared with a net loss of approximately  in fiscal  a change of approximately million 
this improvement of net income was comprised principally of an increase in revenues of  and a decrease of  in cost of goods sold  resulting in a million increase in gross margin 
key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
this is followed by sampling small numbers of the product for the customer s test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
this annuity revenue stream can also generate low cost  high volume type orders 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we face several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
the discussions of our results as presented in this annual report include use of the non gaap terms ebitda and gross margin 
ebitda is discussed below 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor  materials  services  fixed costs for rent  utilities and depreciation  and variable overhead 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap financial measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates our cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses 
we use gross margin in measuring the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  ebitda  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our month backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher month backlog is better for us 
the month backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate month backlog q q q q q q q q our month backlog at june  was approximately million compared to million as of june  we believe this decrease in the month backlog is temporary as there were three large orders expected in the fourth quarter of that were delayed until the first quarter of totaling over  bookings and quote activity have continued to increase for our industrial low cost lenses in asia and we project continued production and shipment growth for these low cost lenses in asia during fiscal we continue to diversify our business by entering into additional markets such as digital imaging  laser tools  telecommunications  digital projectors  industrial equipment  weapon sights and green lasers 
we expect to show increases in revenue for fiscal as a result of this diversification 
ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by management  lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation financial position and core operating performance 
investors sometimes use ebitda as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization 
ebitda also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables  inventory and payables  which can also indicate a significant need for  or source of  cash 
since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow  ebitda is not a good indicator of a business cash flows 
we use ebitda for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the company core operations and for planning purposes 
we calculate ebitda by adjusting net income loss to exclude net interest expense  income tax expense or benefit  depreciation and amortization  thus the term earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and the acronym ebitda 
we also calculated an adjusted ebitda which excludes the effect of the non cash expense associated with the mark to market adjustments related to our june warrants 
we believe this adjusted ebitda is helpful for investors to better understand the financial results of our business operations 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda as well as to adjusted ebitda for the preceding eight quarters fiscal quarter ended net income loss depreciation amorization interest exp 
ebitda warrant adjustment adjusted ebitda the primary reason for the improvement in adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the same period in fiscal is due to higher revenue  improved margins and the warrant adjustment resulting in net income 
the primary reason for the decline in ebitda in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the same period in fiscal is due to net losses 
inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
we review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average our average dcsi for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal this increase in dcsi for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to higher inventory balances as we ramped up production for higher sales forecasts and the impact of a decrease in cost of goods sold due to our continued cost reduction efforts 
we will continue to review inventory balances and sales forecast quarterly in order to manage our inventory levels more effectively 
accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
we escalate our collection efforts when invoices are fifteen days past the due date 
weekly  we also review all receivables that are sixty days past terms 
these past due accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average our average dso for fiscal was compared to for fiscal for the past two years over of our quarterly sales are shipped in the third month of each quarter 
these revenues will not be collected before the quarter ends  which negatively impacts our dso 
also international sales which are approximately one third of our revenues have a longer collection cycle 
we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible 
we strive to have dso no higher than critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves for obsolescence  revenue recognition  valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this prospectus 
the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable  is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over days past due from the due date and of the total of invoices that are over days past due from the due date 
accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
we perform continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected 
if our actual collection experience changes  revisions to its allowance may be required 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished lenses  collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
inventory costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
acquisition of goods from our vendors has a purchase burden added to cover customs  shipping and handling costs 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed 
we look at the following criteria for parts to consider for the inventory reserve items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply 
these items as identified are reserved at  as well as reserving for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last twelve months and reserving for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months 
the parts identified are adjusted for recent order and quote activity to determine the final inventory reserve 
in the third quarter of fiscal we placed a reserve on our isolator inventories due to our current sales forecast for this product line 
property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from one to ten years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  tooling and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
deferred rent relates to certain of our operating leases containing predetermined fixed increases of the base rental rate during the lease term being recognized as rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we have recorded the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts payable under the leases as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue relates to a million purchase order from raytheon for which revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the company is using the cost to cost method to allow it to measure progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs 
the company recorded in deferred revenue  or other receivables  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  based on the difference between the amounts invoiced on the project and the amount recognized into revenue or expenses incurred 
as of june   the company invoiced  and recognized  as revenue with the difference of  recorded as other receivables 
at june   we had no billed accounts receivable outstanding with respect to this purchase order 
the project is expected to be completed by december income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on the basis of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits or penalties has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit or penalty since the date of adoption 
if there were an unrecognized tax benefit or penalty  we would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal  state  local  or us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before revenue is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer  provided that we have received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones and are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products  reports or designs to the customer 
invoice amounts for sales or vat taxes are posted to the balance sheet and not included in revenue 
new product development costs are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit as of the date of grant using the black scholes merton pricing model 
most awards granted under our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan vest ratably over two to four years and generally have four to ten year contract lives 
the volatility rate is based on four year historical trends in class a common stock closing prices and the expected term was determined based primarily on historical experience of previously outstanding awards 
the interest rate used is the united states treasury interest rate for constant maturities 
the likelihood of meeting targets for option grants that are performance based are evaluated each quarter 
if it is determined that meeting the targets is probable then the compensation expense will be amortized over the remaining vesting period 
management makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes available  which in turn could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
financial instruments 
we account for financial instruments in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are either directly or indirectly observable 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of june  we use the market approach to measure fair value for its level financial assets and liabilities  which include cash equivalents of  and million at june  and  respectively 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the respective carrying value of certain on balance sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values 
these financial instruments which include cash  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand 
the company values its warrant liabilities based on open form option pricing models which  based on the relevant inputs  render the fair value measurement at level the company bases its estimates of fair value for warrant liabilities on the amount it would pay a third party market participant to transfer the liability and incorporates inputs such as equity prices  historical and implied volatilities  dividend rates and prices of convertible securities issued by comparable companies maximizing the use of observable inputs when available 
the company does not have any other financial or non financial assets or liabilities that would be characterized as level or level instruments 
derivative financial instruments 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with fasb asc  derivatives and hedging asc  which requires additional disclosures about the company s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments  how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how the derivative instruments and related hedging items affect the financial statements 
the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow  market or foreign currency risk 
terms of convertible debt instruments are reviewed to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under asc to be accounted for separately from the host contract  and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of derivative liabilities  if any  is required to be revalued at each reporting date  with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results 
freestanding warrants issued by the company in connection with the issuance or sale of debt and equity instruments are considered to be derivative instruments 
pursuant to asc  an evaluation of specifically identified conditions is made to determine whether the fair value of warrants issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative liability 
comprehensive income loss of the company is defined as the change in equity net assets of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
comprehensive income loss has two components  net income loss and other comprehensive income loss  and is included on the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
our other comprehensive income loss consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment 
business segments are required to be reported by the company 
as we only operate in principally one business segment  no additional reporting is required 
recent accounting pronouncements issued by fasb including emerging issues task force eitf  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and the securities and exchange commission sec did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company s present or future financial statements 
in july the fasb issued asu  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists  which amends asc  income taxes 
this new guidance requires that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit be offset against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met 
the provisions of this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted
