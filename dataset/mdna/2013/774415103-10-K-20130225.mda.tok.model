item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary we are a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced  high value added specialty chemicals and advanced materials 
we serve more than  customers across a wide variety of industries and geographic areas 
we operate through five business segments lithium  surface treatment  performance additives  titanium dioxide pigments  and advanced ceramics 
we are focused on growth  productivity  cost reduction  margin expansion  divestment of non core businesses  debt reduction and bolt on acquisitions 
in connection with this focus  among other things in february  we issued a new tranche of term loan a under our existing senior secured credit facility in the amount of million and used the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem all of our outstanding notes million and million  or million in the aggregate based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of payment 
in june  our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program and declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share in july  september and december million in the aggregate 
in february  we announced that our board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to per share 
in june  our titanium dioxide venture  sachtleben gmbh  entered into a new facility agreement 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the facility is million million  consisting of million million of term loan a  million million of term loan b and a million million revolving credit facility 
the venture used the proceeds to retire existing term loans million million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of payment  pay a dividend to the venture partners million million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of payment  of which million was paid to rockwood and million was paid to kemira and to acquire certain business assets  particularly production assets and inventory  of crenox gmbh 
in september  our indirect owned subsidiary  rockwood specialties group  inc rsgi  issued billion of senior notes due in notes 
in october  we used a portion of the proceeds to prepay million of term loan b under our senior secured credit facility  and expect to use the remaining proceeds to fund general corporate purposes  which may include the repurchase of shares of our common stock  strategic investments and the repayment of debt 
in january  we announced that our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of rockwood common stock up to an aggregate amount of million 
we expect to effectuate these repurchases beginning in see item a 
risk factors dividends and stock repurchases there can be no guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase our stock 
the following table is a summary of our financial highlights year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income from continuing operations adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to rockwood holdings  inc shareholders results total net sales were down in compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of currency changes and lower volumes across most segments  particularly in titanium dioxide pigments and performance additives 
this was partially offset by increased selling prices across most segments 
adjusted ebitda decreased in compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower volumes  higher raw material costs  particularly in titanium dioxide pigments  and the negative impact of currency changes 
this was partially offset by increased selling prices across most segments 
net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were higher in compared to the same period in the prior year primarily from a million reversal of our federal valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under item  business forward looking statements and item a  risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item  selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report

factors which affect our results of operations our markets because the businesses in our segments generally serve many unrelated end use markets  we discuss the principal market conditions on a segment basis rather than a consolidated basis 
the principal market conditions in our segments and regions in which we operate that impacted our results of operations during the periods presented include the following lithium demand for our lithium carbonate products is generally driven by demand in industrial applications  the aluminum business  the battery industry  glass ceramics and cement 
sales of lithium products specifically used in life science applications depend on the trends in drug development and growth in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals markets  as well as generic competition 
in  net sales were up primarily from increased volumes of lithium products and increased selling prices 
in  net sales were up primarily from increased selling prices  as well as higher volumes of lithium carbonate used in battery applications and lithium specialties  partially offset by a decline in lithium carbonate technical grade and potash volumes 
we expect net sales growth in driven primarily by increased volumes  particularly in lithium products used in battery applications  as well as higher selling prices 
surface treatment demand for surface treatment products generally follows the activity levels of metal processing manufacturers  including the automotive  steel and aerospace industries 
in  net sales were up from higher volumes in all markets  particularly automotive and general industrial  as well as increased selling prices 
in  net sales were down slightly from lower volumes in europe across most markets  partially offset by higher selling prices and increased volumes in the us and asia 
we expect net sales growth in primarily from increased volumes across most markets  particularly in general industry  as well as higher selling prices 
performance additives generally  a trend towards the increased use of colored concrete products in the construction market has historically had a positive effect on our color pigments and services business line 
however  a general slowdown in the construction market has negatively impacted construction sales 
north american construction volumes were lower in in  north american construction volumes were flat 
european construction volumes were up slightly in  but were down in volumes of coatings and specialties products were down in and we expect some net sales growth in primarily from higher selling prices  as well as some volume growth in certain markets 
a strengthening of the us housing market could have a favorable impact on results 
demand for our wood protection products is generally driven by both repair and remodeling  as well as new construction 
in and  net sales were up primarily from higher selling prices 
in  a shift in the mix of products from acq to copper azole and ecolife is expected to have a favorable impact on results 
in the clay based additives business  higher volumes in most markets  particularly oilfield  and higher selling prices had a favorable impact on net sales in in  net sales were down as lower north american oil and natural gas drilling volumes and lower coatings and inks volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices 
we expect modest net sales growth in mainly from our specialty growth product lines primarily in our coatings and composites markets 
titanium dioxide pigments demand for our titanium dioxide products in anatase grade is driven mainly by demand in the synthetic fiber industry  while demand for titanium dioxide products in rutile grade and our functional additives business are driven by demand in the coatings  printing inks  construction  cosmetics  pharmaceutical  food  paper and plastics industries 
in  net sales were up as higher selling prices were partially offset by lower volumes 
in  net sales were down as the negative impact of currency changes and lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices 
we expect net sales growth in driven primarily by increased volumes from the full year impact of the crenox gmbh acquisition  partially offset by lower selling prices 
furthermore  we expect a weak performance in the first half of the year with results improving in the second half should pricing and raw material costs stabilize 
our functional additives sales were up in as higher selling prices had a favorable impact on results 
in  our functional additives sales were down as lower volumes were partially offset by increased selling prices 
we expect net sales growth in driven primarily by increased volumes  partially offset by lower selling prices 
in july  our sachtleben titanium dioxide venture acquired certain business assets  primarily inventory and other production assets  of crenox gmbh  a german titanium dioxide producer 
on february   we acquired kemira s interest in the titanium dioxide pigments joint venture for a purchase price of million  subject to certain adjustments 
as a result  we own of the titanium dioxide pigments business see note  subsequent events 
in  we expect to pursue and consider all strategic options available to us regarding our titanium dioxide pigments business 
advanced ceramics demand for our ceramic components for medical devices is mainly tied to the aging population in europe and the united states 
sales of our medical device applications increased in and on higher volumes 
we expect net sales growth of medical applications in primarily driven by increased volumes in ceramic hip applications 
sales of most other product applications  including cutting tools  mechanical applications and electronic applications were up in on higher volumes 
in  sales volumes of electronic applications  cutting tools and mechanical systems were down 
lower volumes of electronic applications were driven by a slowdown in the market for power electronic applications in the energy and semiconductor industries and lower volumes of mechanical systems were driven by lower demand for cartridges 
in  we expect ceramic electronic applications to increase from organic growth and increased net sales in mechanical systems on higher selling prices 
in  we expect net sales for cutting tools to be slightly lower due to a slowdown of worldwide automotive production 
global exposure we operate a geographically diverse business  with of our net sales in generated from shipments to customers in europe  to north america predominantly the united states  to asia and to the rest of the world
