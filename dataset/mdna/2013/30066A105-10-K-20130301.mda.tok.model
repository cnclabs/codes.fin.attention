the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under risk factors and forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our business we are a leading provider of imes  peer and bill reviews  and related services  which include legal support services  administrative support services and medical record retrieval services 
we were incorporated as a delaware corporation on april  from july  through the date of this filing  we have acquired ime businesses  including a leading provider of software solutions to the ime industry 
we currently operate out of service centers servicing all us states  canada  the united kingdom and australia 
we provide our services to property and casualty insurance carriers  law firms  third party claim administrators  government agencies  and state funds that use independent services to confirm the veracity of claims by sick or injured individuals for workers compensation  automotive  personal injury liability and disability insurance coverage 
we help our clients manage costs and enhance their risk management processes by verifying the validity  nature  cause and extent of claims  identifying fraud and providing fast  efficient and quality ime services 
we provide our clients with the local presence  expertise and broad geographic coverage they increasingly require 
our size and geographic reach give our clients access to our medical panel of credentialed physicians and other medical providers and our proprietary information technology infrastructure that has been specifically designed to streamline the complex process of coordinating referrals  scheduling appointments  complying with regulations and client reporting 
our primary service is to provide imes that give our clients authoritative and accurate answers to questions regarding the nature and permanency of medical conditions or personal injury  their cause and appropriate treatment 
additionally  we provide peer and bill reviews  which consist of medical opinions by members of our medical panel without conducting physical exams  and the review of physician and hospital bills to examine medical care rendered and its conformity to accepted standards of care 
prior to the mes acquisition in february  we marketed our services primarily under the examworks brand 
initially with the mes acquisition and subsequently with the premex and medhealth acquisitions  we began to market our services under several brands  including but not limited to  examworks  mes  premex and medhealth 
we operate in a highly fragmented industry and have completed numerous acquisitions 
a key component of our business strategy is growth through acquisitions that expand our geographic coverage  provide new or complementary lines of business  expand our portfolio of services  and increase our market share 
for example  our acquisition of medhealth in august enabled us to enter the australian market and  expand our range of clients and services  and increase our international market presence 
another central feature of our business strategy is to grow our business organically by selling additional services to existing clients  cross selling into additional insurance lines of business and expanding our geographic footprint with existing clients 
to date  we have completed the following acquisitions acquisition date name december  pmg august  medhealth july  makos october  bronshvag october  matrix health management october  capital vocational specialists north york rehabilitation centre september  mls group of companies medicolegal services may  premex group february  mes group february  national ime centres december  royal medical consultants october  bmegateway september  uk independent medical services september  health cost management august  verity medical exigere june  soma medical assessments direct ime network medical review independent medical services diagnostics march  metro medical services march  american medical bill review medical evaluations december  abeton medical assurance group mednet ims qualmed ime operations of physicians practice august  the evaluation group august  benchmark medical consultants july  ime software solutions may  florida medical specialists marquis medical administrators april  ricwel july  cfo medical services crossland medical review services southwest medical sources of revenues and expenses revenues we derive revenue primarily from fees charged for independent medical examinations  peer and bill reviews and other related services  which include litigation support services  administrative support services and medical record retrieval services 
revenues are recognized at the time services have been performed and  if applicable  at the time the report is shipped to the end user 
we expect revenue to continue to increase through acquisition and organic growth 
our revenue is derived from services performed in different geographic areas 
certain agreements with customers in the uk include provisions whereby collection of the amounts billed are contingent on the favorable outcome of the claim 
we have deemed these provisions to preclude revenue recognition at the time of sale  as collectability is not reasonably assured and the sales are contingent  and are deferring these revenues  net of estimated costs  until the case has been settled and the contingency has been resolved and the cash has been collected 
costs of revenues costs of revenues are comprised of fees paid to members of our medical panel  other direct costs including transcription  film and medical record obtainment and transportation  and other indirect costs including labor and overhead related to the generation of revenue 
we expect these operationally driven costs to increase to support future revenue growth and as we continue to grow through acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sga expenses consist primarily of expenses for administrative  human resource related  corporate information technology support  legal primarily from transaction costs related to acquisitions  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees primarily from transaction costs related to acquisitions  insurance and other corporate expenses 
we expect that sga expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel to support the growth of our business and pursue acquisition growth 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur additional personnel expenses  professional service fees  including audit and legal  investor relations  costs of compliance with securities laws and regulations  and higher director and officer insurance costs related to operating as a public company 
as a result  we expect that our sga expenses will continue to increase in the future but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as our revenue increases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization d a expense consists primarily of amortization of our finite lived intangible assets obtained through acquisitions completed to date and  to a lesser extent  depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we expect that depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we continue our acquisition strategy

adjusted ebitda in connection with the ongoing operation of our business  our management regularly reviews adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to assess our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  acquisition related transaction costs  share based compensation expenses  and other non recurring costs 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management  lenders  investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period to period after removing the impact of changes to our capitalization structure  acquisition related costs  income tax status  and other items of a non operational nature that affect comparability 
we believe that various forms of the adjusted ebitda metric are often used by analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies such as ours for the reasons discussed above 
additionally  adjusted ebitda is used to measure certain financial covenants in our credit facility 
adjusted ebitda is also used for planning purposes and in presentations to our board of directors as well as in our incentive compensation programs for our employees 
non gaap information should not be construed as an alternative to gaap information  as the items excluded from the non gaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results 
management uses  and investors should use  non gaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results

liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are to fund operations and acquisitions 
to date  we have funded our capital needs from cash flow generated from operations  private placements of our common and preferred stock  our initial public offering ipo  borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the private offering of the senior unsecured notes  as defined below 
we have also funded our acquisition program with equity issuances to sellers and with seller debt financing 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents  availability under our existing credit and working capital facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our operations  planned capital expenditures and acquisitions for at least the next months 
although we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and acquisition plans for at least the next months  we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities or increase borrowings to fund acquisitions 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders

on may   we increased and fully exercised the accordion features of the senior secured revolving credit facility 
the increase and exercise of the accordion feature increased the committed capacity of the credit facility by million  from a total of million to a total of million 
concurrently with the foregoing  we amended the senior secured revolving credit facility to  among other things  i permit its maximum senior leverage ratio to temporarily increase from to to to for the quarters ending june and september  and to for the quarter ending december  and to thereafter  and ii permit the netting of unrestricted domestic cash in excess of million but not exceeding million against funded indebtedness for purposes of calculating leverage ratios

critical accounting policies and estimates overview and definitions we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to accounts receivable reserves  goodwill and other intangible assets  share based compensation other equity instruments  income and other taxes  derivative instruments and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the impact of changes in key assumptions may not be linear 
our management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following revenue recognition revenue related to imes  peer reviews  bill reviews and administrative support services is recognized at the time services have been performed and the report is shipped to the end user 
we believe that recognizing revenue at the time the report is shipped is appropriate because we meet the following four criteria in accordance with asc s  revenue recognition overall  i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii shipment has occurred  iii the price is fixed and determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we report revenues net of any sales  use and value added taxes 
revenue related to other ime services  including litigation support services and medical record retrieval services  where no report is generated  is recognized at the time the service is performed 
we believe that recognizing revenue at the time the service is performed is appropriate because we meet the following four criteria in accordance with asc s  i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii services have been rendered  iii the price is fixed and determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
certain agreements with customers in the uk include provisions whereby collection of the amounts billed are contingent on the favorable outcome of the claim 
we have deemed these provisions to preclude revenue recognition at the time of sale  as collectability is not reasonably assured and the sales are contingent  and are deferring these revenues  net of estimated costs  until the case has been settled the cash has been collected and the contingency has been resolved 
for the year ended december   we had deferred million in contingent revenues and million in costs associated with the contingent revenues 
for the year ended december   we deferred an additional million in contingent revenues and million in costs associated with the contingent revenues 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable balances consist of amounts owed to us for services provided in the normal course of business and are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  no collateral is received from clients and the collectability of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as client credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns and additions to the allowance are made based on these trends 
accounts are reviewed regularly for collectability and those deemed uncollectible are written off 
we assume  that on average  all accounts receivable will be collected within one year and thus classify these as current assets  however  there are certain receivables  principally in the uk  that have aged longer than one year as of december   and we have recorded an estimate for those receivables that will not be collected within one year as long term in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
based on the provisions of asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual valuations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
intangible assets  including client relationships  trade names  covenants not to compete and technology that have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill in october and reviewed subsequent events through december  and determined that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of year end 
further  we believe that there have been no facts or circumstances through the date of this filing that indicate an impairment of goodwill exists 
deferred income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we generated million of us federal taxable income in the year ended december   fully utilizing our us federal net operating losses nols from in  in conjunction with the mes acquisition  we acquired million of nols 
these nols were subject to annual limitations resulting from the change in control provisions in section of the internal revenue code irc section 
we generated million of us federal taxable income in the year ended december  and utilized million of the nols in to offset against this us federal taxable income 
as of december   we had million in nols to offset against future us federal taxable income 
additionally  in conjunction with the mes acquisition  we acquired alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards of  which may be used to offset future us federal tax liabilities 
as of december  we had  in foreign tax credits related to income taxes payable at certain of our business located in the uk which may be used to offset against future us federal tax liabilities 
for the year ended december   we generated an estimated million of us federal taxable income and fully utilized million in nols from the year 
for the year ended december  we utilized amt credits of  to offset our us federal tax liabilities 
during the year ended december   we generated an additional estimated million in foreign tax credits related to income taxes payable at certain of our businesses located in the uk and australia and utilized million in foreign tax credits to offset our current tax liability 
additionally  in we utilized million of option related tax benefits  reducing our income taxes payable by million  the benefit of which was recorded to additional paid in capital 
additionally  we currently have significant deferred tax assets and other deductible temporary differences including basis differences between intangible assets 
we do not provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized based on available evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and other tax planning considerations 
we apply the provisions of asc  income taxes asc  as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
this guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclosure in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
asc states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
as of december   the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits was approximately  we recorded an additional liability of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to acquired liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalties on prior year tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we are no longer subject to us federal income or state tax return examinations by tax authorities before and  respectively  which periods relate to certain acquired businesses 
the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of our us income tax returns for during the second quarter of  and in january of  we received a closure letter from the irs stating that no adjustments were identified 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and face audits from various tax authorities 
we remain subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective tax jurisdiction 
we do not anticipate that the amount of the unrecognized benefit will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal income taxes has been recorded 
deferred taxes are provided for earnings outside the united states when those earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested 
share based compensation and other equity instruments our stock incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options and share based awards in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires measurement of compensation cost for all share based awards at fair value on the grant date or measurement date  if different and recognition of compensation expense  net of forfeitures  over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
we use the straight line amortization method for recognizing share based compensation expense 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in these employee stock options 
additionally  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of the stock price 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates  in our opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share based awards 
our expected volatility assumptions are based upon our peer group average implied volatility for and are based upon our peer group median implied volatility for and expected life assumptions for first three quarters of are based upon the average of the simplified method as described in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term  and the contractual term of the option  in accordance with asc  which states that if no amount within the range is more or less likely than any other amount  an average of the range its expected value should be used for those options issued significantly out of the money  and are based upon the simplified method for those options issued in the fourth quarter of and the full years of and which were determined to be issued approximately at the money 
the risk free interest rate was selected based upon yields of us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
the following table summarizes the number of stock options granted and outstanding as of december  for the quarterly periods from january  through december   the per share exercise price of the stock options and estimated per share weighted average fair value of stock options quarter ending number of shares subject to options granted and outstanding weighted average per share exercise price of options weighted average per share fair value of options march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  as described above  the per share estimated fair value of stock options was estimated for the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model estimates the fair value by applying a series of factors including the exercise price of the stock option  the fair market value of our common stock  a risk free interest rate  the expected term of the stock option  expected share price volatility of the underlying common stock and expected dividends on the underlying common stock 
additional information regarding our valuation of common stock and option awards is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounting for acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired entity 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  including the fair value of certain forms of consideration such as our common stock  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues  cash flows and terminal value  which are then discounted at an estimated discount rate  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives of the assets 
the projections are developed using internal forecasts  available industry and market data and estimates of long term rates of growth for our business 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
financial instruments in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance codified as asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in u 
s generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
asc  financial instruments asc  delayed the effective date of the application of asc to fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the company has not applied the provisions of asc primarily include those measured at fair value in goodwill and long lived asset impairment testing  those initially measured at fair value in a business combination  and nonfinancial liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc establishes a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following levels in determining fair value  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterpart credit risk in the assessment of fair value 
level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level unobservable inputs based on the company s own assumptions 
our financial liabilities  which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  are categorized using the fair value hierarchy as of december  and were as follows in thousands level level level total as of december  financial instruments interest rate swap contingent consideration as of december  financial instruments interest rate swap contingent consideration the fair value of the interest rate swap is determined using observable market inputs  such as current interest rates  and considers nonperformance risk of the company and that of our counterparties 
the contingent consideration relates to earnout provisions recorded in conjunction with certain acquisitions completed in and of the total decrease in fair value of the contingent consideration of  in   was settled as cash consideration to satisfy installments related to and acquisitions  approximately  of the change in value relates to the release of a restriction associated with shares previously issued related to a acquisition and approximately  was recorded in interest and other expenses  net in the consolidated statements of operations due to changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration 
recent accounting pronouncements in addition to the recently adopted accounting pronouncements discussed above in conjunction with our critical accounting policies  we believe the following recently adopted accounting pronouncements are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu addressing revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminates the residual method of allocation  requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and significantly expands disclosure requirements 
the guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted the provisions of asu effective january  and this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosure asu 
this update provides amendments to codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which require new disclosures about transfers in and out of levels and and the reasons for the transfers as well as reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of asu on january   and adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board on fair value measurement 
these amendments have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
the common requirements are expected to result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted these provisions effective january  and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june and december  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu and asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asc  comprehensive income  respectively 
these update amend asc topic  comprehensive income to provide that total comprehensive income is to be reported in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements of financial performance 
presentation of total comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity or the footnotes is no longer allowed 
the calculation of net income and basic and diluted net income per share is not affected 
these asus are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after december  we adopted these provisions effective january  and the adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists previously is necessary 
the fair value calculation for goodwill is required unless the company concludes  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value 
if such a decline in fair value is deemed more likely than not to have occurred  then the quantitative goodwill impairment test must be completed  otherwise  goodwill is deemed to be not impaired and no further testing is required until the next annual test date or sooner if conditions or events before that date raise concerns of potential impairment in the business 
the amended goodwill impairment guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted these provisions effective january  and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu is intended to reduce the costs and complexity of the annual impairment testing related to indefinite lived intangibles assets by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
this new standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we adopted these provisions in the fourth quarter of and the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there were various other accounting standards and interpretations issued during and that we have not yet been required to adopt  none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates as well as inflation 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates which affect our debt as well as cash flows 
we may also face additional exchange rate risk in the future as we expand our business internationally 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
these amounts were held for future acquisition and working capital purposes and were held in non interest bearing accounts  of which million were held in the us therefore  the us amounts were insured in full through december  under section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which provided temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts at all fdic insured depository institutions 
our outstanding debts of million and million at december  related to indebtedness under our working capital facilities and senior secured revolving credit facility  respectively  and contain floating interest rates 
thus  our interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in our variable rate debt would result in an increase of approximately million in our annual pre tax net loss assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at december  in august  as required under our then existing credit facility  in order to protect against interest rate exposure on its variable rate debt  we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate applicable to our variable rate debt 
the agreement swaps one month libor for a fixed interest rate of 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
foreign exchange risk 
as of december   we have foreign currency risks related to our revenues and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  namely  the canadian dollar  the pound sterling and the australian dollar 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the canadian dollar and the pound sterling given that the net difference between foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses is immaterial 
in the future  however  we may hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in these currencies 
in september  in order to protect against foreign currency exposure on our australian operations  we borrowed in australian dollars as a hedge of our net investment in australia related to the medhealth acquisition 
we have outstanding debt of approximately aud million that is designated as a hedge of our net investment in australia as of december  this non derivative net investment hedge was classified as long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with asc  the translation of this debt instrument designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
this instrument will mature in conjunction with amounts outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility
