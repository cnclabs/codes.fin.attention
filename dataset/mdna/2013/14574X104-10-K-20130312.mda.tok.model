table of contents company overview we are one of the largest restaurant companies in the united states and have been operating restaurants for more than years 
we are the largest burger king franchisee in the world and have operated burger king restaurants since as of december   we operated burger king restaurants in states 
on may   we acquired restaurants from bkc  which we refer to as the acquired restaurants 
our restaurants operated prior to the acquisition are referred to as our legacy restaurants 
our former indirect wholly owned subsidiary  fiesta restaurant group  inc  which we refer to as fiesta  was spun off by us to our stockholders on may  the results of operations and cash flows of fiesta are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the discussion in our md a is focused on our continuing burger king restaurant operations 
sales from our acquired restaurants are excluded from changes in our comparable restaurant sales in the following is an overview of the key financial measures discussed in our results of operations restaurant sales consist of food and beverage sales  net of discounts  at our restaurants 
restaurant sales are influenced by changes in comparable restaurant sales  menu price increases  new restaurant openings and closures of restaurants 
restaurants are included in comparable restaurant sales after they have been open for months 
for comparative purposes  the calculation of the changes in comparable restaurant sales is based on a week year 
cost of sales consists of food  paper and beverage costs including packaging costs  less purchase discounts 
cost of sales is generally influenced by changes in commodity costs  the sales mix of items sold and the effectiveness of our restaurant level controls to manage food and paper costs 
restaurant wages and related expenses include all restaurant management and hourly productive labor costs and related benefits  employer payroll taxes and restaurant level bonuses 
payroll and related benefits are subject to inflation  including minimum wage increases and increased costs for health insurance  workers compensation insurance and state unemployment insurance 
restaurant rent expense includes base rent and contingent rent on our leases characterized as operating leases  reduced by the amortization of deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions 
other restaurant operating expenses include all other restaurant level operating costs  the major components of which are royalty expenses paid to bkc  utilities  repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes and credit card fees 
advertising expense includes all promotional expenses including advertising payments based on a percentage of sales as required under our franchise agreements 
general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants  legal  auditing and other professional fees and stock based compensation expense 
historical general and administrative expenses exclude all amounts associated with fiesta as those amounts are included in income loss from discontinued operations and include an offset to general administrative expenses as if the transition services agreement with fiesta was in place for all periods presented 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures 
ebitda represents net income loss from continuing operations  before provision benefit for income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges  acquisition and integration costs  eeoc litigation and settlement costs  stock compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt 
we exclude these items from ebitda when evaluating our operating performance and believe that adjusted ebitda provides a more meaningful comparison than ebitda of our core business operating results  as well as with those of other similar companies that may have different capital structures 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda  when viewed with our results of operations calculated in accordance with gaap and our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss from continuing operations  provide useful information about our operating performance and period over period growth  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss from continuing operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
also  these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies 
for a reconciliation between net income loss from continuing operations and ebitda and adjusted ebitda see page ebitda and adjusted ebitda  have important limitations as analytical tools 
these limitations include the following 
table of contents ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our capital expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service principal or interest payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations 
however  some of these charges such as impairment expense have recurred and may reoccur 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes the depreciation of fixed assets  including equipment  owned buildings and leasehold improvements utilized in our restaurants and the amortization of franchise rights from our acquisitions of restaurants and franchise fees paid to bkc 
impairment and other lease charges are determined through our assessment of the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of these assets can be recovered over their respective remaining lives through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
a potential impairment charge is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
lease charges are recorded for our obligations under the related leases for closed locations net of estimated sublease recoveries 
there are no lease charges accrued for closed locations at december  interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our senior secured second lien notes due  borrowings under our prior carrols llc senior secured credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
there were no borrowings under our new senior credit facility in recent and future events affecting our results of operations acquisition of burger king restaurants on may   we completed the acquisition of restaurants from bkc  for a purchase price consisting of i a equity ownership interest  ii a net cash purchase price of million net of million of cash on hand and iii additional consideration of million including million for bkc s assignment of its right of first refusal on franchisee restaurant transfers in states pursuant to an operating agreement  dated as of may  with bkc 
the amount for the rofr is payable in quarterly payments over five years and the first quarterly payment of million was made at closing on may  we also entered into new franchise agreements pursuant to the purchase and operating agreements and entered into leases with bkc for all of the acquired restaurants  including leases for restaurants owned in fee by bkc and subleases for restaurants under terms substantially the same as bkc s underlying leases for those properties 
pursuant to the operating agreement  we also agreed to remodel burger king restaurants to bkc s restaurant image by as of december  we had remodeled restaurants to the restaurant image 
in we currently anticipate remodeling to restaurants 
the results of operations of the acquired restaurants have been included in our operating results from may   the day following the closing of the acquisition 
refinancing of outstanding indebtedness on may   we issued million of senior secured second lien notes due and entered into a new senior credit facility that provides for up to million of revolving credit borrowings which was undrawn at closing 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to i repay all outstanding borrowings under the prior carrols llc senior credit facility of million ii pay million related to the acquisition of the acquired restaurants from bkc and iii fees and expenses related to the offering of the notes 
the remainder of the net proceeds will be used together with operating cash flow and the cash collateral account  as it becomes unrestricted  to fund the restaurant remodeling obligations committed to in connection with the acquisition of the acquired restaurants  and to fund future payments to bkc for the rofr 
interest expense associated with this indebtedness  including the amortization of deferred financing costs  will be approximately million in spin off of fiesta restaurant group  inc on april   our board of directors approved the spin off of fiesta  which through its subsidiaries  owns and operates the pollo tropical and taco cabana restaurant brands 
in connection with the spin off  on april   we and carrols entered

fiesta filed with the sec a form registration statement  file no 
 as amended  which included as an exhibit an information statement which describes the spin off 
the form registration statement  which registered the common stock of fiesta under the exchange act  was declared effective by the sec on april  on may   we completed the spin off of fiesta in the form of a pro rata dividend of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of fiesta to carrols restaurant group s stockholders whereby each stockholder of carrols restaurant group s common stock of record on april  received one share of fiesta common stock for every one share of carrols restaurant group common stock held

future restaurant remodeling obligations committed to in connection with the acquisition have also been excluded from the table above 
long term debt obligations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for details of our long term debt 
lease guarantees 
as of december   we are a guarantor under fiesta restaurant property leases  with lease terms expiring on various dates through  and we are the primary lessee on five pollo tropical restaurant property leases  which we sublease to fiesta 
we are fully liable for all obligations under the terms of the leases in the event that fiesta fails to pay any sums due under the lease  subject to indemnification provisions of the separation and distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin off 
the maximum potential liability for future rental payments we could be required to make under these leases at december  was million 
the obligations under these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
no payments have been made to date and none are expected to be required to be made in the future 
we have not recorded a liability for those guarantees in accordance with asc guarantees as fiesta has indemnified us for all such obligations and we did not believe it was probable we would be required to perform under any of the guarantees or direct obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our operating leases  which are primarily for our restaurant properties and not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
inflation the inflationary factors that have historically affected our results of operations include increases in food and paper costs  labor and other operating expenses and energy costs 
wages paid in our restaurants are impacted by changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates 
accordingly  changes in the federal and state hourly minimum wage rates directly affect our labor costs 
we typically attempt to offset the effect of inflation  at least in part  through periodic menu price increases and various cost reduction programs 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary cost increases in the future 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in the significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
sales recognition at our restaurants is straightforward as customers pay for products at the time of sale and inventory turns over very quickly 
payments to vendors for products sold in the restaurants are generally settled within days 
the earnings reporting process is covered by our system of internal controls and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments 
however  critical accounting estimates and judgments  as noted below  are inherent in the assessment and recording of insurance liabilities  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  assessing impairment of long lived assets and lease accounting matters 
while we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions 
acquisition accounting 
we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc  business combinations asc 
as required by asc  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their respective fair values as of the business combination date 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long lived assets  such as property  equipment and intangible assets 
we use available information to make these fair value determinations and  when necessary  engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets and intangible assets 

table of contents insurance liabilities 
the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance claims under policies where we pay all claims  subject to annual stop loss insurance limitations both for individual claims and claims in the aggregate 
we record insurance liabilities based on historical and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and adjust accruals as warranted by changing circumstances 
since there are estimates and assumptions inherent in recording these insurance liabilities  including the ability to estimate the future development of incurred claims based on historical claims experience and loss reserves  current claim data  and the severity of the claims  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities 
as of december   we had million accrued for these insurance claims 
evaluation of goodwill 
we must evaluate our recorded goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment review of goodwill at our fiscal year end and we determined that we have one reporting unit at that date 
we may first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we compare the net book value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  we employ a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market based approach 
assumptions include our anticipated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital 
the results of these analyses are corroborated with other value indicators where available  such as comparable company earnings multiples 
this annual evaluation of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units including projections regarding future operating results and market values 
we had one reporting unit with goodwill balances as of our most recent measurement date 
our impairment test at december  indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately million 
this estimate may differ from actual future events and if this estimate or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for this asset 
we did not record any impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   january  or january  impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets  principally property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment at the restaurant level by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets to their respective carrying values 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term  including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions  including our ability to sell the related assets and market conditions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of burger king franchise rights 
we assess the potential impairment of burger king franchise rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine if there is impairment by comparing the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows from those acquired restaurants with the respective carrying value of franchise rights for each burger king acquisition 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of the acquired restaurants including sales trends  labor rates  commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions over their remaining franchise life 
if acquired franchise rights are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the franchise rights carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
lease accounting 
judgments made by management for our lease obligations include the length of the lease term  which includes the determination of renewal options that are reasonably assured 
the lease term can affect the classification of a lease as capital or operating for accounting purposes  the term over which related leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized  and any rent holidays and or changes in rental amounts for recognizing rent expense over the term of the lease 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we also must evaluate sales of our restaurants which occur in sale leaseback transactions to determine the proper accounting for the proceeds of such sales either as a sale or a financing 
this evaluation requires certain judgments in determining whether clauses in the lease or any related agreements constitute continuing involvement 
for those sale leasebacks that are accounted for as financing transactions  we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate  or another rate in cases where the incremental borrowing rate is not appropriate to utilize  for purposes of determining interest expense and the resulting amortization of the lease financing obligation 
changes in the determination of the incremental borrowing rates or other rates utilized in connection with the accounting for lease financing transactions could have a significant effect on the interest expense and underlying balance of the lease financing obligations 

table of contents income taxes 
we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as the work opportunity tax credit  as well as estimates of tax depreciation based on methods anticipated to be used on our tax returns 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes our historical  current and future financial performance 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a deferred tax valuation allowance of million related to certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  primarily limited to the senior credit facility 
at december   there were no outstanding revolving credit borrowings under the senior credit facility 
under the senior credit facility  we have deposited million in an account with the administrative agent as collateral for the senior credit facility until the date on which its adjusted leverage ratio is less than x for two consecutive fiscal quarters the cash collateral release date 
prior to the cash collateral release date  revolving credit borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum  at our option  of all terms as defined in the senior credit facility i the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin of or ii the libor rate plus the applicable margin of following the cash collateral release date  borrowings under the senior credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum  at our option  of i the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin of to based on our adjusted leverage ratio  or ii the libor rate plus the applicable margin of to based on our adjusted leverage ratio 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market price fluctuations in beef and other food product prices caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
given the historical volatility of beef and other food product prices  this exposure can impact our food and beverage costs 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
where possible  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases that are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing 
however  long term increases in commodity prices may result in lower restaurant level operating margins
