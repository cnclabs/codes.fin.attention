item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company using our expertise in the tumor microenvironment to discover and develop therapeutic agents that selectively target tumor cells for the treatment of patients living with cancer 
our lead investigational small molecule  th  is being evaluated in two pivotal phase clinical trials and multiple earlier stage clinical trials 
we have a global license and co development agreement for th with merck kgaa  with an option to co commercialize in the united states 
th was discovered by our scientists based on our hypoxia activated prodrug hap technology 
hypoxia  or abnormally low oxygen concentration  is a common feature of the tumor microenvironment in most solid tumors and in the bone marrow of patients with some hematological malignancies also known as blood cancers  for example  leukemias and multiple myeloma 
tumor hypoxia is associated with the development of resistance to traditional anticancer treatments  including chemotherapy and radiotherapy  enhanced metastatic potential  and ultimately treatment failure 
normal healthy tissues  in contrast  are well oxygenated and typically are not hypoxic 
as a prodrug  th is designed to remain essentially inactive in normal tissues  but to activate under conditions of tumor hypoxia 
upon activation  th releases bromo isophosphoramide mustard br ipm  a potent cytotoxin that kills cells by causing dna to crosslink 
we believe that by virtue of targeting tumor hypoxia  th has broad clinical applicability across many types of solid tumors and some hematological malignancies 
to explore this broad therapeutic potential of th  we are conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with currently marketed anticancer drugs  including traditional chemotherapeutic agents and antiangiogenic agents 
th is currently in phase  phase and phase clinical trials 
the development plan for th is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety across a broad range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies 
we reported updated top line results from the initial phase monotherapy trial of th trial including indication specific data in patients with metastatic melanoma and small cell lung cancer sclc 
we have also reported results from each of four phase combination therapy investigations of a chemotherapy agent plus th in solid tumors involving combining th with doxorubicin  gemcitabine  docetaxel and pemetrexed 
we have also reported results from our clinical study of th in patients with advanced leukemias trial and initiated a clinical study of th in patients with multiple myeloma trial 
in addition  investigations have been initiated to explore the combination of th with antiangiogenic therapies including a phase dose escalation clinical trial of th in combination with sunitinib sutent in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors trial and physician initiated clinical trial of th administered either in combination with bevacizumab avastin in patients with recurrent high grade astrocytoma including glioblastoma or in combination with pazopanib votrient in patients with solid tumors 
in september  european society for medical oncology esmo congress in vienna  austria we announced preliminary data from the physician initiated clinical trial of th in combination with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma 
in february of we reported top line results from the randomized and controlled phase trial of th plus gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer trial 
the median progression free survival progression free survival was months for patients treated with gemcitabine in combination with th at mg m and mg m compared to months for patients treated with gemcitabine alone 
the progression free survival hazard ratio comparing the th combination to gemcitabine alone was confidence 
table of contents interval which was highly statistically significant p and represented a improvement in progression free survival 
the response rate in the combination arms was compared to in the gemcitabine alone group 
results also demonstrated greater efficacy in the higher th dose group compared to the lower dose group 
the combination had a safety profile that was consistent with our prior study of this combination regimen 
as in that study  skin and mucosal toxicities related to th were dose dependent but not dose limiting 
in april  we provided detailed results from our trial at the american association of cancer research aacr annual meeting including results for each of the mg m and mg m th combination arms 
the median progression free survival was months in the mg m group 
the response rate was in the mg m group 
a similar dose dependency was reported in serum ca levels 
there was greater drug exposure in the combination groups with a median of cycles received with gemcitabine alone compared with cycles in the mg m group and cycles in the mg m group 
the combination safety profile was consistent with the prior study of this combination regimen 
as in that study  skin and mucosal toxicities were less than what had been seen at the single agent maximum tolerated dose of th  which was previously established at mg m the incidence of grade thrombocytopenia and grade neutropenia was significantly higher in the combination arms and highest in the mg m group 
discontinuations for adverse events were lowest however in the mg m group 
in september  at esmo congress  updated results were presented confirming a significant improvement p in progression free survival 
the updated progression free survival hazard ratio comparing the th combinations to gemcitabine alone was confidence interval 
this was associated with a month increase in median progression free survival for patients receiving th mg m new findings from the phase b trial were presented including an analysis of overall survival  which was a secondary endpoint of the study 
this analysis indicated that patients treated with gemcitabine alone had a median overall survival of months compared with months for patients treated with mg m th plus gemcitabine hr  ci  p and months for patients treated with mg m th plus gemcitabine hr  ci  p 
while not statistically significant  the improvement in median overall survival is consistent with the improvement in median progression free survival reported previously 
the trial was not designed to detect a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and included a cross over component 
patients receiving gemcitabine alone who crossed over to receive gemcitabine plus th upon disease progression contributed to an increase in survival of the control arm 
th continued to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with what had been previously reported at aacr 
the most common adverse events were fatigue  nausea  constipation and peripheral edema  and were similar across groups 
skin and mucosal toxicities and myelosuppression were the most common adverse events related to th  were mostly grade and  and did not result in increases in treatment discontinuation 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment as well as serious adverse events were balanced across all treatment arms 
grade adverse events were generally below 
in december  merck kgaa opened maestro a global phase trial of th plus gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer 
maestro stands for th in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
in  we presented updated top line results from our phase combination therapy in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with doxorubicin plus th at the maximum tolerated dose of mg m trial 
we also provided additional data from the maintenance component as well as an update on the overall efficacy of the phase component of the trial at the th ctos annual meeting in november in february  we reached agreement with the fda on the design and planned analysis of a pivotal phase trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma trial 
as part of the special protocol assessment spa submission  the fda agreed that the design and planned analysis of the proposed phase trial adequately addresses the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 
we initiated the pivotal phase trial in september of and currently expect to complete enrollment around the end of we are working to broaden the applicability of th to other cancers and in combination with other approved anti cancer drugs as well as to discover additional hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 

table of contents we were incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates  and prior to our entering into a collaboration agreement with merck kgaa in february  we have funded our operations through the private public placement and public offerings of our equity securities 
on february   we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa  which to date has provided for million in upfront and milestone payments  including million received subsequent to december  we expect to receive additional million in potential milestone payments in during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock under our at market issuance sales facility for net proceeds of million  and we received approximately million from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
for the year ended december   we had an operating loss of million and a net loss of million  including million in non cash expense related to the change in the fair value of outstanding warrants 
our cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses net of reimbursements of merck s share of total th development expenses  are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months based upon current operating plans  milestone payment forecasts and spending assumptions 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to support new in house development programs or to in license or otherwise acquire and develop additional products or programs 
we intend to seek funds through additional arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term 
we recognized revenue of million during the year ended december   from the amortization of the million in upfront and milestone payments earned in from our collaboration with merck kgaa 
we are amortizing the upfront and milestone payments over the period of performance product development period 
we will periodically review and  if necessary  revise the estimated periods of performance of our collaboration 
in  we recognized million in revenue in connection with our agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals eleison for the development of glufosfamide  which represents our share of an upfront payment from a sublicense by eleison 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  public relations  finance  patent  corporate development and other administrative functions  including 
table of contents non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value provisions of accounting standard codification asc  compensation stock compensation 
refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue  from the amortization of the million in upfront and milestone payment earned in from our collaboration with merck kgaa 
subsequent to december   we earned an additional million milestone payment 
we are amortizing the upfront payment and milestones earned over the period of performance product development period 
we will periodically review and  if necessary  revise the estimated periods of performance of our collaboration 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue related to our agreement with eleison for the development of glufosfamide  which represents our share of an upfront payment from a sublicense by eleison 
for the year ended december   no revenue was recognized 
we expect revenue to increase in compared to due to the full year amortization of milestone payments earned in as well amortization of additional potential milestone payments we expect to earn in from our collaboration with merck kgaa 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses is due primarily to a million reimbursement for merck s share of total development expenses for th and a million decrease in consulting expenses  partially offset by million increase in clinical development expenses  million in employee related expenses and million in non cash stock based compensation

th continues to progress through the trial  maestro trial  the trial  and the trial 
we reported top line results for the trial in february and detailed results in april we also provided additional overall survival data on the trial in september of 
table of contents discovery research and development expenses were million in  million for and million for we continue to focus our efforts towards discovering and developing new drug candidates from our hypoxia activated prodrug platform 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts under our collaboration with merck as well as on our own 
research and development expenses  including reimbursements of merck s share of development expenses  are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and the start of new clinical trials 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million increase reflects a million increase in non cash stock compensation expense  million in higher consulting expenses and a million in higher staffing and facilities expenses 
partially offsetting these increases is a million reimbursement of merck s share of patent expenses and employee expenses related to th in we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to due to increased staffing and consulting expenses to support activities related to our collaboration with merck kgaa and the ongoing development of th interest income expense  net interest income expense net for was  of interest income compared to  of net interest income for the increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher invested balances during than the prior year 
other income expense other income expense for was non cash expense of million compared to non cash income of million for the non cash expense for compared to the non cash income for was due to a change in the fair value of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock and warrants exercised during as result of a change in the underlying market price of common stock of the company 
asc derivatives and hedging requires that stock warrants with certain terms be accounted for as a liability with changes to their fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue related to our agreement with eleison for the development of glufosfamide  which represents our share of an upfront payment from a sublicense by eleison 
for the year ended december   no revenue was recognized 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses  million in higher staffing expenses and million in higher consulting expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in facilities expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense increased by million 

table of contents research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for the increase of million in was due primarily to an increase in million in clinical and manufacturing costs  million increase in consulting costs  partially offset by a decrease in employee related expenses of million 
th continues to progress through the trial  the trial and the trial 
the and trials were expanded and enrollment of patients was completed in the second quarter of in october  we reported updated top line results for the trial and we reported top line results for the trial in february enrollment in the trial was completed in the fourth quarter of  and top line results were presented in the fourth quarter of discovery research and development expenses were million in and million for we continue to focus our efforts towards discovering and developing new drug candidates from our hypoxia activated prodrug platform

asc derivatives and hedging requires that stock warrants with certain terms be accounted for as a liability with changes to their fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of million since inception through december  we have not generated and do not expect to generate revenue from sales of product candidates in the near term 
since our inception  we funded our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities and through payments received under our license and co development agreement with merck kgaa 
during the year ended december   we sold an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock under our at the market stock issuance facility for net proceeds of million  and we received approximately million from the exercise of warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
during the year ended december  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of under our at the market stock issuance facility  for net proceeds of million 
in march  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and  for a purchase price equal to per share  warrants exercisable for a total of approximately million shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to million in connection with the offering 
the warrants have an exercise price equal to per share 
net proceeds generated from the offering were approximately million  which includes underwriter discounts and offering costs 

table of contents on february   we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa and to date have received upfront and milestone payments of million  including million in milestone payments received subsequent to december  we could also receive an additional million in a potential milestone payment in we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million at december  and december   respectively  available to fund operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million respectively 
the increase of million in cash provided by operations in compared to cash used in operations in was primarily attributable to million of cash received from upfront and milestone payments related to the merck kgaa collaboration during year ended december   partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and payments of accrued expenses 
the increase of million in cash used in operations in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development spending associated with th net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of million  offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting million received during primarily as a result of our issuance of common stock under the at the market stock issuance facility  million received from the cash exercise of warrants to purchase shares of common stock  and million cash received from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
net cash provided by financing activities for year ended december  was million and primarily due to the approximately million of net proceeds from our march registered direct offering and million net proceeds from equity issuances pursuant to our at the market stock issuance facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   due to proceeds from the sale of stock under our equity incentive plans  partially offset by deferred offering costs 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months based upon current operating plans  milestone payment forecasts and spending assumptions 
we may need to raise additional capital to in license or otherwise acquire and develop additional products or programs 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising new in house development programs or in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

table of contents in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq capital market 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments we lease certain of our facilities under noncancelable leases  which qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under asc  leases  and  as such  these facilities are not included on our consolidated balance sheets 
in july  we entered into a noncancelable facility sublease agreement for  square feet of laboratory space and office space located in south san francisco  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease began on october  and will expire on april  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs associated with the premises  in amounts yet to be determined 
we will also be responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the execution of the lease we paid a security deposit of approximately our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our operating lease agreements and purchase commitments under contract research  development and clinical supply agreements 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december  are as follows in thousands one to three years to four to five years to after five years total facilities leases purchase commitments total at the market stock issuance facility on october   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mlv co  llc  formerly mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc mlv  pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
sales of our common stock through mlv will be made on the nasdaq capital market  on any other existing trading market for our common stock  to or through a market maker or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement  mlv will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose 
we will pay mlv an aggregate commission rate of of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share of any common stock sold under the sales agreement 
under certain circumstances  sales of the stock under the at market issuances sales agreement could result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
the number of shares we are able to sell under this arrangement will be limited in practice based on the trading volume of our common stock

license and development agreements on february   we entered into a global license and co development agreement with merck kgaa  of darmstadt  germany  to co develop and commercialize th  our small molecule hypoxia targeted drug 
under the terms of the agreement  merck will receive co development rights  exclusive global commercialization rights and will provide us an option to co commercialize th in the united states 
in exchange  we received an upfront payment of million and received another million in development milestones  including million subsequent to december  we can earn additional potential milestone payments of million  comprised of million in regulatory and development milestones and million in sales based milestones 
in the united states  we will have primary responsibility for development of th in the soft tissue sarcoma indication 
we with merck kgaa will jointly develop th in all other cancer indications being pursued 
merck kgaa will pay of worldwide development costs for th subject to fda approval in the united states  merck kgaa will initially be responsible for commercialization of th while we will receive a tiered  double digit royalty on sales 
under the royalty bearing portion of the agreement  we retain the option to co promote th in the united states 
additionally  we retain the option to co commercialize th upon the achievement of certain sales or regulatory milestones  allowing us to participate in up to of the profits in the united states depending on total sales 
outside of the united states  merck kgaa will be solely responsible for the commercialization of th while we will receive a tiered  double digit royalty on sales in these territories 
the agreement became effective on march   upon termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of the agreement will continue on a country by country basis until the later of the last to expire patent covering th in such country or ten years following the commercial launch of a product containing th in such country  unless terminated earlier 
merck has the right to terminate the agreement after the achievement of certain milestones  and each party has the right to terminate the agreement following uncured material breach by the other party 
on october   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals  inc eleison 
pursuant to the agreement we granted eleison exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize glufosfamide for the treatment of cancer in humans and animals  and certain other uses 
under the agreement  eleison is responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of glufosfamide 
eleison and threshold will share equally in the profits of commercialization  if the further clinical development of glufosfamide leads to regulatory approval and marketing 
eleison will pay us of its profits from commercialization on a quarterly basis  beginning on the date of first commercial sale  if any 
eleison has the right to sublicense some or all of its rights under the agreement  and will pay us of amounts received under any sublicenses  including  without limitation  any royalty payments  license fee payments  milestone payments and payments for any equity or debt purchases by a sublicensee  within days of the receipt of any such amounts or payments by eleison 
eleison will bear all costs associated with development  commercialization and patent prosecution  and will control product development and commercialization 
in addition  eleison will be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments due under the baxter license and medibic development agreement discussed below 
the agreement contemplates that eleison  to satisfy its diligence obligations  will raise sufficient funds to commence clinical development activities with glufosfamide 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized the federal carryforward will expire in the state research credit carryforward does not have an expiration date 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc revenue recognition  subtopic asc revenue with multiple element arrangements and subtopic asc revenue recognition milestone method  which provides accounting guidance for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and guidance on defining the milestone and determining when the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions is appropriate  respectively 
our revenues are related to our collaboration arrangement with merck kgaa  which was entered in february our collaboration with merck provides for various types of payments to us  including non refundable upfront license  milestone and royalty payments 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or 
table of contents determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we will also receive reimbursement for merck s share for eligible worldwide development expenses for th such reimbursement would be reflected as a reduction of operating expenses and not as revenue 
for multiple element arrangements  each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the deliverables under the merck agreement have been determined to be a single unit of accounting and as such the revenue relating to this unit of accounting will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of its estimated performance period under the agreement  which is the product development period 
we determine the estimated performance period  and it will be periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related product development plan 
the effect of a change made to an estimated performance period and therefore revenue recognized ratably would occur on a prospective basis in the period that the change was made 
deferred revenue associated with a non refundable payment received under a collaborative agreement for which the performance obligations are terminated will result in an immediate recognition of any remaining deferred revenue in the period that termination occurred provided that all performance obligations have been satisfied 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments when i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability has substantive uncertainty at the inception of the agreement  and ii we do not have ongoing performance obligations related to the achievement of the milestone earned 
milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment a is commensurate with either our performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance subsequent to the inception of the arrangement to achieve the milestone  b relates solely to past performance  and c is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement
