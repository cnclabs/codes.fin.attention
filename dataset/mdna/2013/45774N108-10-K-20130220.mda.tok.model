recent trends and outlook market demand was flat to moderately lower in  with this trend accentuated by year end destocking 
although we are encouraged by what looks to be a strong start to  this partly represents a carry over of december orders to january  and we remain cautious on overall demand levels for momentum continues to improve in our product innovation and geographic expansion initiatives  however  we currently expect only modest market growth in overall  we expect growth in specialty phosphates around the low end of our long term target with further growth of approximately anticipated from the full year benefit of acquisitions completed in first quarter revenue growth is expected to be moderately below the full year expectation in comparison to a strong first quarter for mexico specialty phosphates 
we do not expect any major change in raw material purchase prices or underlying selling prices through the first quarter however  the us canada segment will have higher sequential costs of goods sold in the first quarter reflecting purchase accounting effects for the triarco acquisition 
we will see a further significant reduction in depreciation as the stepped up asset values created at the formation of the company in reach the end of their depreciation lives 
this will be partly offset by the amortization of the intangibles associated with recent acquisitions 
overall  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be million lower in than in  of which million will benefit specialty phosphates 
this benefit  combined with improved mix and better operating leverage  is expected to increase specialty phosphates operating income margins by approximately basis points sequentially 
we expect full year specialty phosphates operating income margins to be similar to the achieved for the first three quarters of for the short term  gtsp is expected to continue near break even through the first quarter 
as with last year  fertilizer prices have been declining through the winter period  and no improvement in pricing is anticipated before the second quarter
