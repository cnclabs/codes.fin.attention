item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials focused on the treatment and diagnosis of cancer 
we are advancing two oncology programs with our lead product candidates  bavituximab and cotara  for the treatment of various cancers 
in addition  we are advancing our lead molecular imaging agent  i pgn  in an exploratory clinical trial for the imaging of multiple solid tumor types 
our pipeline of novel investigational monoclonal antibodies is based on two first in class technology platforms  including phosphatidylserine ps targeting antibodies and dna histone targeting antibody cotara 
the following is an update of our oncology and imaging programs in clinical stage development under these first in class technology platforms bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors bavituximab is our lead therapeutic ps targeting antibody  which has demonstrated broad therapeutic potential and represents a new approach to treating cancer 
ps is a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the membrane of healthy cells  but flips and becomes exposed on the outside of cells that line tumor blood vessels  causing the tumor to evade immune detection 
bavituximab targets ps and activates the maturation of dendritic cells and cancer fighting m macrophages leading to the development of cytotoxic t cells that fight tumors 
we have conducted three randomized phase ii trials for bavituximab in combination with standard chemotherapy in both front and second line non small cell lung cancer nsclc as well as front line pancreatic cancer 
in addition  we have four ongoing investigator sponsored trials ist evaluating bavituximab with additional drug combinations in additional oncology indications 
from these randomized phase ii clinical trials and ists conducted to date  we have identified second line nsclc as our lead indication for bavituximab based on promising survival data from our phase iib randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of stage iiib iv nsclc patients treated with bavituximab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as second line treatment  which was recently presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting  data presented at the american academy for cancer research aacr annual meeting which yielded definitive insight into bavituximab immunotherapy mechanism of action  our increased understanding of docetaxel s immune stimulatory properties and apoptotic inducing properties  promising survival data from our single arm phase iia evaluating bavituximab plus docetaxel in advanced metastatic breast cancer  and compelling preclinical data demonstrating synergistic anti tumor effects when bavituximab is combined with docetaxel 
in addition  in june  we conducted a comprehensive review of our bavituximab oncology program with the goal of adapting a clinical development plan in accordance with the recent increased understanding of the immune stimulatory properties of bavituximab 
we believe that several of the ongoing clinical trials could corroborate bavituximab immunotherapy mechanism of action in the clinic as they include patient sample collection for immune correlative testing 
we are also actively working with our clinical collaborators on how best to design future trials evaluating the potential of combining bavituximab with other immunotherapy agents in addition to the chemotherapy combinations that are currently underway 
the following represents an overview of recently completed  ongoing or currently planned bavituximab clinical trials phase iii registration trial bavituximab plus docetaxel in second line nsclc in may  we reached agreement with the us food and drug administration fda on a pivotal phase iii registration trial design of our lead clinical immunotherapeutic candidate bavituximab in second line nsclc 
this phase iii clinical trial will be a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial evaluating bavituximab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone and will enroll approximately patients at clinical sites worldwide 
the trial will enroll non squamous  nsclc patients who have progressed after standard front line treatment 
the patients will be randomized into one of two treatment arms 
one treatment arm will receive docetaxel mg m  up to six day cycles  in combination with bavituximab mg kg weekly until progression or toxicity 
the second treatment arm will receive docetaxel mg m  up to six day cycles  in combination with placebo weekly until progression or toxicity 
the primary endpoint of the trial will be overall survival 
we anticipate initiating this trial by calendar year end the design of this phase iii trial was supported by promising data from our phase iib trial in the same indication as described below 
phase iib trial bavituximab plus docetaxel in second line nsclc we conducted a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase iib second line nsclc trial evaluating two dose levels of bavituximab plus docetaxel bavituximab containing arms versus docetaxel plus placebo control arm as second line treatment in patients with stage iiib iv nsclc 
patients were randomized to one of three treatment arms at clinical sites worldwide and enrollment was completed in october all patients were randomized to receive up to six day cycles of docetaxel mg m 
in addition  one arm was randomized to receive bavituximab mg kg weekly  a second arm was randomized to receive bavituximab mg kg weekly  and a third arm was randomized to receive placebo weekly until progression or toxicity 
the trial was designed to evaluate overall response rate orr  the primary endpoint  measured in accordance with response evaluation criteria in solid tumors recist criteria  and progression free survival pfs  duration of response  overall survival os  and safety  were secondary endpoints 
on september   we announced that during the course of preparing for an end of phase ii meeting with regulatory authorities and following the data announcement on september  from this phase iib trial  we discovered major discrepancies between some patient sample test results and patient treatment code assignments 
as a result of these discrepancies  the data that we disclosed on or before september  should not be relied upon 
upon discovery of the discrepancies  we initiated an internal review of this phase iib trial  which included the testing of investigational product  patient samples  reviewing the operations of multiple vendors  among other activities 
the initial results of this internal review were announced on january   and indicated that discrepancies were isolated to the control and mg kg bavituximab containing treatment arms of the trial and that there was no evidence of discrepancies in the mg kg bavituximab containing treatment arm of the trial 
based on the results of our internal review  we took a conservative approach toward analyzing the results from the trial  which included combining the control arm and mg kg bavituximab containing arm into one treatment arm combined control arm  and comparing those results to the mg kg bavituximab containing treatment arm 
on february   we reported updated top line survival data from this trial based upon the completion of the aforementioned internal review of discrepancies in the trial and updated patient survival data from the trial 
updated top line data from this phase iib trial indicated a meaningful improvement in median os of months in the mg kg bavituximab containing arm compared to months in the combined control arm 
on june   we presented the following final data from this phase iib trial at the asco annual meeting mg kg bavituximab containing arm combined control arm median overall survival months months overall response rate median progression free survival months months in addition  subgroup analyses of overall survival by key patient characteristics favored the bavituximab mg kg containing arm  including age  gender  eastern cooperative oncology group ecog status  ethnicity and prior treatment 
the results also indicated that the mg kg bavituximab plus docetaxel combination was well tolerated with no significant differences in adverse events between the two trial arms 
based on these data and discussions with our medical advisors  our strategy is to initiate a pivotal phase iii trial with bavituximab in second line nsclc by the end of calendar year as further discussed above 
phase ii trial bavituximab plus paclitaxel carboplatin in front line nsclc our phase ii trial is designed to assess bavituximab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in front line nsclc 
this randomized trial enrolled patients enrollment completed in september at clinical sites worldwide 
patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms 
all patients were randomized to receive up to six day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin c p 
in addition  one arm was randomized to receive bavituximab mg kg weekly until progression or toxicity 
the primary endpoint of this trial is orr and secondary endpoints include median pfs  median os  duration of response  and safety 
patients were evaluated regularly for tumor response according to recist criteria 
in march  we announced top line data from this phase ii trial in which the primary orr endpoint was determined 
initial orr and median pfs data from this trial were deemed inconclusive and therefore  it was determined that median os  another secondary endpoint  would be an important data point in determining our next steps in advancing bavituximab in front line nsclc in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
prompted by the enhanced understanding of bavituximab immunotherapy mechanism of action we presented at the aacr annual meeting  we recently undertook a review of our entire ongoing bavituximab clinical program  including an early analysis of this phase ii front line nsclc trial  in order to better direct our clinical development strategy 
results from this analysis  which included less than of survival events  were announced in june and indicated that while the bavituximab containing treatment arm currently demonstrated a median os of over months  there was no meaningful difference in survival between the two arms of the trial that would support the advancement of this combination and the current timing of therapy 
separately  an independent study with another immunotherapy agent showed that when c p are given together with immunotherapy  as was done in this trial  the results were similar to the control arm while starting with c p before administering the immunotherapy gave much more favorable results 
we are currently evaluating options for moving bavituximab forward in front line nsclc 
we plan to present the full results from this phase ii trial at a future scientific meeting or through publication 
phase ii trial bavituximab plus gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer our phase ii trial was designed to assess bavituximab in combination with gemcitabine in previously untreated stage iv pancreatic cancer patients 
this randomized trial enrolled patients enrollment completed in june at clinical sites worldwide 
patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms 
all patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine mg m on days  and of each day cycle weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities 
in addition  patients in one arm were randomized to receive bavituximab mg kg weekly 
the primary endpoint of this trial was median os and secondary endpoints include median pfs  orr  duration of response  and safety 
patients were evaluated regularly for tumor response according to recist criteria 
in february  we announced results from this trial showing that the combination of bavituximab and gemcitabine resulted in more than a doubling of orr and an improvement in os when compared with gemcitabine alone control arm 
in the trial  patients treated with a combination of bavituximab and gemcitabine had a tumor response rate as compared to in the control arm 
median os was months for the bavituximab plus gemcitabine arm and months for the control arm 
in this trial  bavituximab was generally safe and well tolerated in combination with gemcitabine with similar adverse events occurring in both arms 
as this trial allowed for the enrollment of patients and older without any age limit  distant organ involvement and ecog performance status of  further analysis of the patient group was warranted 
in june  we announced final results from this trial which included a further analysis of patient subgroups 
median os  pfs and orr results were unchanged from the february announcement with data showing encouraging activity in this patient population with very rapid disease progression 
results from a subgroup analysis showed that the effect of bavituximab plus gemcitabine was more pronounced in patients with ecog and those without hepatic metastases 
while we believe the final data combined with the results from subgroup analyses warrant future consideration  given the fast progression of pancreatic cancer and the need for longer treatment periods associated with immunotherapies such as bavituximab  there are no plans to initiate a follow on trial in pancreatic cancer at this time 
investigator sponsored trials ist with respect to our ists  our clinical collaborators are evaluating bavituximab with additional drug combinations in additional oncology indications  which we believe will provide additional insight into bavituximab s mechanism of action  augment our safety database and evaluate new combination therapy approaches to treating cancer patients 
the below table is a summary of our current ists indication product combination no 
patients phase status her negative metastic breast cancer bavituximab combined with paclitaxel i patient enrollment completed 
interim data showed of patients or of patients achieved an objective tumor response  including of patients or of patients achieving a complete response measured in accordance with recist criteria 
one patients was not evaluable as of data analysis 
combination of bavituximab and paclitaxel was safe and well tolerated 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  or liver cancer bavituximab combined with sorafenib nexavar up to i ii patient enrollment in phase i portion of study completed 
patient enrollment in phase ii portion of study ongoing 
interim data from patients enrolled in the phase i portion of study showed no dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events 
front line nsclc bavituximab combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin up to ib patient enrollment ongoing 
interim data from the first five patients showed three of the five patients achieving a partial tumor response and there were no signs of unexpected safety events 
rectal adenocarcinoma stage ii or iii patients bavituximab combined with capecitabine and radiation up to i patient enrollment ongoing 
no data reported to date 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our ist program based on a number of factors  including enrollment and changes in the standard of care of patients for each of our ongoing ists 
as a result of our recent evaluation  during march  we discontinued a phase i ii ist evaluating bavituximab combined with cabazitaxel in patients with second line castration resistant prostate cancer due to slow enrollment in the trial which we believe will continue due to two new oral drugs that had been approved for the same indication following the inception of this ist 
we will continue to monitor our ist program as we look to evaluate new indications and combinations based on the broad therapeutic potential of bavituximab 
ps targeting molecular imaging program pgn in addition to bavituximab s therapeutic potential to treat multiple solid tumors  we believe these ps targeting antibodies may have broad potential for the imaging and diagnosis of multiple diseases  including cancer 
in april  we filed an exploratory investigational new drug application ind with the fda to advance our lead molecular imaging agent  i pgn pgn  into clinical development for the imaging of multiple solid tumor types 
our initial goal for the pgn program is to further validate the broad nature of the ps targeting platform in the clinic 
the current trial will enroll up to patients and results from this study may provide new insight into new indications and potential applications  including development of antibody drug conjugates  the ability of pgn to monitor the effectiveness of current standard cancer treatments  and the ability to potentially select patients that may benefit from bavituximab based treatment 
cotara for the treatment of brain cancer cotara is our lead dna histone targeting antibody and represents a novel approach to treating brain cancer 
cotara is a targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a radioisotope  iodine  that is administered as a single infusion  one time therapy directly into the tumor  thereby destroying the tumor from the inside out with minimal exposure to surrounding healthy tissue 
cotara has been granted orphan drug status and fast track designation for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma by the fda 
in december  we reached an agreement with the fda on the trial design for a single registration trial for cotara in patients with recurrent gbm 
this trial is based on data from patients treated with cotara in our phase ii recurrent gbm trial and other earlier phase i trials 
we are currently seeking a partner to further develop cotara in recurrent gbm 
integrated biomanufacturing subsidiary in addition to our clinical research and development efforts  we operate a wholly owned cgmp current good manufacturing practices contract manufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc avid 
avid is a contract manufacturing organization that provides fully integrated services from cell line development to commercial cgmp biomanufacturing for peregrine and its third party clients 
in addition to generating revenue from providing a broad range of biomanufacturing services to third party clients  avid is strategically integrated with peregrine to manufacture all clinical products to support our company sponsored and investigator sponsored clinical trials while also preparing for potential commercial launch of bavituximab and cotara 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change revenues contract manufacturing    government contract revenue license revenue     total revenues    cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing   research and development   selling  general and administrative   total cost and expenses   loss from operations    other income expense interest and other income    interest and other expense    loss on early extinguishment of debt  net loss    contract manufacturing revenue years ended april  and compared to the years ended april  and the increases in contract manufacturing revenue of  or and  or during the years ended april  and  respectively  compared to fiscal years and  respectively  were primarily due to increases in the number of completed manufacturing runs in the years ended april  and  which can be attributed to increases in demand for manufacturing services from avid s third party customers 
based on the current commitments for manufacturing services from avid s third party customers and the anticipated completion of in process third party customer manufacturing runs  we expect contract manufacturing revenue for fiscal year to be in line with fiscal year government contract revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue was derived from a former government contract the government contract awarded to us in june  through the transformational medical technologies tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the government contract  which expired on april   was to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the fiscal year decrease in government contract revenue was a direct result of the expiration of the government contract on april  license revenue years ended april  and compared to the years ended april  and the changes in license revenue in fiscal year and compared to fiscal years and  respectively  were directly related to revenue recognized in accordance with the terms of our existing license agreements 
based on our existing license agreements  we do not expect license revenue to be a significant source of revenue in fiscal year cost of contract manufacturing years ended april  and compared to the years ended april  and the increases in cost of contract manufacturing of  or and  or during the years ended april  and  respectively  compared to fiscal years and  respectively  were primarily due to fiscal year and increases in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  we saw an improvement or percentage decrease in the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue over the three years ended april  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year to in fiscal year this improvement or lower cost of contract manufacturing was primarily attributed to the increasing number of completed manufacturing runs from fiscal year to fiscal year and the higher gross margins associated with these services 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily include i payroll and related costs associated with research and development personnel  ii costs related to clinical and preclinical testing of our technologies under development  iii costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates  including raw materials and supplies  product testing  depreciation  and facility related expenses  iv expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories  including sponsored research funding  and v other research and development expenses 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to the following changes associated with each of the following technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform ps targeting    cotara    total r d expenses    o ps targeting bavituximab and pgn the decrease in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreases in third party vendor costs regarding our three separate company sponsored phase ii trials using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with i front line nsclc  ii second line nsclc  and iii pancreatic cancer  as the majority of patients in these trials were enrolled prior to may  in addition  the current year decrease was supplemented with a decrease in third party vendor costs associated with a prior completed phase ii trial using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated genotype hepatitis c virus hcv infection that completed enrollment in september these decreases in clinical trial expenses were further supplemented with a decrease in manufacturing costs incurred in the current year associated with preparing bavituximab for potential later stage clinical trials combined with a decrease in sponsored research fees associated with our preclinical anti viral program 
these decreases in ps targeting program expenses were offset by increases in payroll and related expenses associated with our lead ps targeting molecular imaging agent  pgn  combined with an increase in share based compensation expense 
o cotara the decrease in cotara related expense of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in third party vendor costs associated with our phase ii trial for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm or brain cancer  which trial completed patient enrollment during fiscal year combined with a current year decrease in payroll and related expenses as our in house development efforts were focused primarily on our ps targeting program 
these decreases in cotara related expenses were offset by an increase in manufacturing costs associated with preparing cotara for potential later stage clinical trials for the treatment of gbm 
based on our current projections  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to increase in comparison to fiscal year as we plan to execute our goal of initiating a global phase iii registration trial using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with second line nsclc by the end of calendar year and continue our exploration of bavituximab s broad potential in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer in other indications and combinations 
these projections include a number of uncertainties  including but not limited to  i the uncertainty of the rate at which patients will be enrolled in any current or future clinical trials  including  our phase iii nsclc registration trial  ii the uncertainty of future clinical and preclinical studies  which are dependent upon the results of current clinical and preclinical studies  iii the uncertainty of obtaining regulatory approval to advance our current exploratory ind clinical program to phase i or to commence any future trials  and iv the uncertainty of terms related to any potential future partnering or licensing arrangement 
during fiscal year  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform as we are actively seeking potential partners to further advance the cotara clinical program 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform ps targeting    cotara    total r d expenses    o ps targeting bavituximab and pgn the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in clinical trial and related expenses  payroll and related expenses  and manufacturing costs to support the advancement of our later stage clinical program for bavituximab 
during fiscal year  we continued to treat patients in three separate randomized multi center phase ii clinical trials using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with i front line nsclc  ii second line nsclc  and iii pancreatic cancer  and announced the completion of patient enrollment of the front and second line nsclc trials during september and october  respectively 
we also continued to enroll and treat patients in a randomized phase ii clinical trial using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated genotype hepatitis c virus hcv infection and announced the completion of patient enrollment during september these increases in ps targeting clinical program expenses were further supplemented by increases in preclinical r d expenses associated with exploring our ps targeting antibodies potential to image tumors  which supported our recent filing of an ind application with the fda during april to advance our lead imaging candidate i pgn into clinical development 
these increases in ps targeting program expenses were offset with a decrease in r d expenses directly related to our former government contract with the tmt  which expired in april  and a decrease in expenses associated with the development of additional ps targeting antibodies under a research agreement with an unrelated entity 
o cotara the increase in cotara related expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily related to increased development costs associated with preparing cotara for potential later stage clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent gbm 
these increases in cotara related expenses were offset by decreases in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our phase ii trial for recurrent gbm  which completed patient enrollment during fiscal year looking beyond the next twelve months  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform although it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with preclinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of the progress and results of our ongoing preclinical and clinical studies  and any additional preclinical and clinical studies we may initiate in the future based on their results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical study  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our non lead indication oncology studies to move forward from phase i clinical studies to phase ii clinical studies or phase ii clinical studies to phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our lead molecular imaging agent  pgn  to move forward from an exploratory study to a phase i or phase ii clinical study  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs  and the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond fiscal year we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  preclinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  share based compensation expense  legal fees  audit and accounting fees  patent fees  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the increase in sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and corporate legal fees of  and  respectively 
the increase in payroll and related expenses is attributed to increases in compensation and other employee related benefits and the increase in corporate legal fees is primarily attributable to the lawsuits described in this annual report on form k under part i  item  legal proceedings 
these increases in sg a expenses were further supplemented with incremental current year increases in audit and accounting fees  market research fees  business development related expenses  and other corporate related expenses 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  sg a expenses for the year ended april  remained in line with fiscal year increasing slightly by  interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was due to an increase in interest income of  combined with an increase in other income of  year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to fiscal year was due to a decrease in interest income of  combined with a decrease in other income of  the fiscal year decrease in other income was directly related to a government grant of  awarded to us in fiscal year under section d of the internal revenue code 
interest and other expense year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal years was directly related to a lower outstanding principal balance associated with a  term loan we secured in december  which we paid in full in december loss on early extinguishment of debt year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was directly related to the term loan we entered into during august that was subsequently repaid in full and terminated in september under an event of default as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
upon the termination of the term loan  we recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of  which consisted of a final payment fee of  the unamortized debt discount associated with the fair value of the warrants issued to the lenders under the term loan of  and unamortized aggregate debt issuance costs of  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently derive revenue from the following two sources i contract manufacturing services provided by avid  and ii licensing revenue related to agreements associated with peregrine s technologies under development 
in addition  from june  through april   we derived government contract revenue from services provided under a government contract awarded to us through the tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the government contract with the tmt expired on april  we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or passage of title has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we also comply with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition regarding arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in addition  we also follow the authoritative guidance when reporting revenue as gross when we act as a principal versus reporting revenue as net when we act as an agent 
for transactions in which we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform a substantive part of the services  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer and costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of cost of sales for contract manufacturing services and as a component of research and development expense for services provided under our former contract with the tmt contract expired on april  
contract manufacturing revenue revenue associated with contract manufacturing services provided by avid is recognized once the service has been rendered and or upon shipment or passage of title of the product to the customer 
on occasion  we recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under bill and hold arrangements  revenue is recognized once the product is complete and ready for shipment  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  management receives a written request from the customer for bill and hold treatment  the product is segregated from other inventory  and no further performance obligations exist 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
license revenue revenue associated with licensing agreements primarily consists of non refundable upfront license fees  non refundable annual license fees and milestone payments 
non refundable upfront license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant license technology  are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
if a licensing agreement has multiple elements  we analyze each element of our licensing agreements and consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition of each element 
multiple element arrangements 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
on may   if a license agreement has multiple element arrangements  we analyze and determine whether the deliverables  which often include performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  and revenue is recognized over the estimated period of when the performance obligation s are performed 
in addition  under certain circumstances  when there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in an arrangement  but no such evidence for the delivered items  we utilize the residual method to allocate the consideration received under the arrangement 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items  and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the undelivered items based on the relative fair value of the undelivered items 
for new licensing agreements or material modifications of existing licensing agreements entered into after may   we follow the provisions of asu no 
if a licensing agreement includes multiple elements  we identify which deliverables represent separate units of accounting  and then determine how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting  which may require the use of significant judgment 
if a licensing agreement includes multiple elements  a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the licensing partner on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each agreement  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company s control 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
milestone payments 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
on may   milestone payments were recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  provided that i the milestone event was substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the fees were non refundable  and iii there was no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
effective may   we adopted on a prospective basis the milestone method under asu no 
for new licensing agreements or material modifications of existing licensing agreements entered into after may  under the milestone method  we recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the company 
the provisions of asu no 
do not apply to contingent consideration for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a counterparty s performance 
we will assess the nature of  and appropriate accounting for  these payments on a case by case basis in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria were recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
government contract revenue government contract revenue was derived from a former government contract the government contract awarded to us on june   through the tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the government contract  which expired on april   was to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the government contract was classified as a cost plus fixed fee contract 
we recognized government contract revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including the authoritative guidance specific to federal government contracts 
reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor  subcontract costs  materials  equipment  travel and indirect costs 
in addition  we received a fixed fee for our efforts equal to of the reimbursable costs incurred under the government contract  which was unconditionally earned as allowable costs were billed and was not contingent on success factors 
reimbursable costs under this government contract  including the fixed fee  were generally recognized as revenue in the period the reimbursable costs are incurred and become billable 
however  when amounts billable  including the fixed fee  were not reasonably related to the proportionate performance of the total work or services to be performed  we recognized revenue on a proportional performance basis 
in addition  reimbursable costs  including the fixed fee  associated with manufacturing services were recognized as revenue once delivery or passage of title had occurred 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options and other share based awards granted under our equity compensation plans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based payments to employees in exchange for services is measured at the grant date  using a fair value based method  and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the share based payment that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense for a share based payment with a performance condition is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period when the achievement of the performance condition is determined to be probable 
if a performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met  no share based compensation is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model and is amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the use of a valuation model requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of our common stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of future dividend payouts 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
in addition  guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there are a number of factors that affect the amount of share based compensation expense  including the number of employee options granted during subsequent fiscal years  the price of our common stock on the date of grant  the volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rates 
in addition  we periodically grant stock options and other share based awards to non employee consultants  which we account for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the cost of non employee services received in exchange for share based awards are measured based on either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the share based award issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
in addition  guidance requires share based compensation related to unvested options and awards issued to non employees to be recalculated at the end of each reporting period based upon the fair market value on that date until the share based award has vested  and any adjustment to share based compensation resulting from the re measurement is recognized in the current period 
research and development expenses research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with the authoritative guidance for research and development costs 
research and development expenses primarily include i payroll and related costs associated with research and development personnel  ii costs related to clinical and preclinical testing of our technologies under development  iii costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates  including raw materials and supplies  product testing  depreciation  and facility related expenses  iv expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories  including sponsored research funding  and v other research and development expenses 
advance payments  including non refundable amounts  to secure the receipt of future research and development services are deferred and capitalized 
these pre payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed 
we assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide future economic benefit 
in addition  we record research and development expenses based on accruals associated with work performed in connection with advancing our clinical trials  which relies on estimates and or representations from clinical research organizations cros  hospitals  consultants and other clinical trial related vendors 
we maintain regular communication with our vendors  including our cro vendors  and gauge the reasonableness of estimates provided 
however  actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
there were no material adjustments for a change in estimate to research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in any of the three years ended april  liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research and development of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue in the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and  amounted to   and  respectively 
therefore  unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue to fund our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
historically  we have funded a significant portion of our operations through the issuance of equity 
during fiscal year  we raised  in aggregate gross proceeds under two separate at market sales issuance agreements as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to april  and through july   we raised an additional  in aggregate gross proceeds under an at market issuance sales agreement as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
with these additional proceeds  we currently estimate that we have sufficient cash resources to meet our anticipated cash needs to fund our operations through at least fiscal year based on our current projections  which includes the initiation of our pivotal phase iii clinical trial of bavituximab combined with docetaxel in second line nsclc  projected cash inflows under signed contracts with existing customers of avid and assuming we raise no additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources 
however  our ability to continue to fund our clinical trials and development efforts in future years  including costs to fund our pivotal phase iii second line nsclc trial beyond fiscal year  is highly dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  financing our operations through the issuance of equity  securing new funding through the issuance of debt  licensing or partnering our products in development  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  we may not be successful in securing debt financing  licensing or partnering our products in development  or generating additional revenue from avid to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
even if we are successful in obtaining debt financing  it may involve restrictive covenants on the operation of our business and require significant interest payments 
with respect to our ability to raise additional capital from the issuance of equity  as of july   we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s  under which we may issue  from time to time  in one or more offerings  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of up to  however  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets is dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for our common stock 
the market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  negative economic conditions  adverse market conditions  adverse clinical trial results  and significant delays in one or more clinical trials 
if our ability to access the capital markets becomes severely restricted  it could have a negative impact on our business plans  including our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities 
in addition  even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities represents our i net loss  as reported  ii less non cash operating expenses  and iii net changes in the timing of cash flows as reflected by the changes in operating assets and liabilities  as described in the below table year ended april  net loss  as reported   less non cash operating expenses share based compensation   depreciation and amortization   loss on early extinguishment of debt  amortization of discount on notes payable and debt issuance costs loss on disposal of property   net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities   net change in operating assets and liabilities  net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in operating activities decreased  to  for the year ended april   compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended april  this decrease in net cash used in operating activities was due to a decrease of  in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses combined with a net change in operating assets and liabilities of  the decrease in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to a current year increase in contract manufacturing revenue combined with a current year decrease in research and development expenses  offset by current year increases in cost of contract manufacturing  selling  general and administrative expenses and loss on early extinguishment of debt 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended april  the current year net decrease was due to a decrease in property acquisitions of  offset by a decrease in other assets of  the current year decrease in property acquisitions was primarily related to a decrease in leasehold improvements and equipment compared to the prior year 
the current year decrease in other assets was primarily related to prior year deposits and or progress payments for certain additional computer software and equipment to enhance operating efficiencies 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended april   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended april  net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year consisted of  in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under two separate at market issuance sales agreements  including net proceeds of  received during the quarter ended april  from the sale of  shares of our common stock after deducting commissions and other issuance costs of  combined with  in aggregate net proceeds received from the purchase of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and from stock option exercises  which were offset with principal payments on capital leases of  in addition  during fiscal year  we received gross proceeds of  under a term loan  excluding debt issuance costs of  which principal amount was repaid in full during the current year upon the termination of the term loan agreement on september  as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we paid a final payment fee of  upon the termination of the term loan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended april   consisted of  in aggregate net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under an at market issuance sales agreement and a registered direct public offering 
in addition  we received net proceeds of  from the purchase of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
these prior year net proceeds were offset with principal payments on a term loan of  which we paid in full in december  and capital lease payments of  contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period total year years years after years operating leases  net    capital lease obligation    other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations   represents our facility operating leases and various office equipment leases 
represents capital lease agreements to finance certain equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay annual maintenance fees and potential future milestone payments based on product development success 
amounts exclude milestone or contractual payment obligations if the amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies adoption of recent accounting pronouncements and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in us interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  however  they would not have an effect on our capital leases  which have fixed interest rates and terms 
based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at april   a near term change in interest rates  based on historical movements  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
