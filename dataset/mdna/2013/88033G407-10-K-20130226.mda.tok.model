item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
in general  we anticipate the continued acceleration of major industry trends we have seen emerge over the last several years  and our strategies reflect the belief that consumers will increasingly select services and providers based on quality and cost  physicians will seek strategic partners with whom they can align clinically and financially  more procedures will shift from the inpatient to the outpatient setting  demand will grow as a result of an improved economy  shifting demographics and the expansion of coverage under the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of the affordable care act  and payer reimbursements will be constrained and further shift to being more closely tied to performance on quality and service metrics 
we believe that our strategies and the acceleration of these trends will allow us to achieve our operational and financial targets 
we adjust our strategies as necessary in response to changes in the economic and regulatory climates in which we operate and the results achieved by our various efforts 
operations hospital operations at december   our subsidiaries operated hospitals  including three academic medical centers  a children s hospital and a critical access hospital  with a total of  licensed beds  serving primarily urban and suburban communities in states 
of those hospitals  were owned by our subsidiaries and five were owned by third parties and leased by our subsidiaries 
in addition  at december   our subsidiaries operated a long term acute care hospital and owned or leased and operated medical office buildings  all of which were located on  or nearby  our hospital campuses 
our subsidiaries also operated free standing and provider based outpatient centers in states at december   including diagnostic imaging centers  ambulatory surgery centers and urgent care centers  among others 
we seek to operate our hospitals and outpatient centers in a manner that positions them to compete effectively in an evolving health care environment 
from time to time  we also build new hospitals and outpatient centers  make strategic acquisitions of hospitals  outpatient businesses  physician practices  and other health care assets and companies  and enter into joint venture arrangements or affiliations with health care businesses in each case in markets where we believe our operating strategies can improve performance and create shareholder value 
in particular  we believe that growth by strategic acquisitions  when and if opportunities are available  can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets 
during the year ended december   we made the following acquisitions a diagnostic imaging center  an oncology center  an urgent care center  a health plan  a cyberknife center in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest  a majority interest in nine ambulatory surgery centers in one of which we previously held a noncontrolling interest  physician practice entities  and a physician practice management company in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest 
we also sometimes decide to sell  consolidate or close certain facilities to eliminate duplicate services or excess capacity or because of changing market conditions or other factors 
in may  we sold diagnostic imaging services  inc  our former 
table of contents diagnostic imaging center business in louisiana  and  in august  we sold our creighton university medical center in nebraska 
our hospitals classified in continuing operations for financial reporting purposes generated in excess of of our net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
factors that affect patient volumes and  thereby  the results of operations at our hospitals and related health care facilities include  but are not limited to the business environment  economic conditions and demographics of local communities  the number of uninsured and underinsured individuals in local communities treated at our hospitals  seasonal cycles of illness  climate and weather conditions  physician recruitment  retention and attrition  advances in technology and treatments that reduce length of stay  local health care competitors  managed care contract negotiations or terminations  any unfavorable publicity about us  which impacts our relationships with physicians and patients  changes in health care regulations and the participation of individual states in federal programs  and the timing of elective procedures 
each of our general hospitals offers acute care services  operating and recovery rooms  radiology services  respiratory therapy services  clinical laboratories and pharmacies  in addition  most offer intensive care  critical care and or coronary care units  physical therapy  and orthopedic  oncology and outpatient services 
a number of our hospitals also offer tertiary care services such as open heart surgery  neonatal intensive care and neurosciences 
three of our hospitals north shore medical center  st 
louis university hospital and hahnemann university hospital offer quaternary care in areas such as heart  liver  kidney and bone marrow transplants 
st 
christopher s hospital for children provides tertiary and quaternary pediatric services  including bone marrow and kidney transplants  as well as burn services 
sierra medical center  good samaritan medical center and north shore medical center offer gamma knife brain surgery  and brookwood medical center  north shore medical center  saint francis hospital and st 
louis university hospital offer cyberknife radiation therapy for tumors and lesions nearly anywhere in the body  including in the brain  lung  neck and spine  that may have been previously considered inoperable or inaccessible by traditional radiation therapy 
in addition  our hospitals will continue their efforts to deliver and develop those outpatient services that can be provided on a quality  cost effective basis and that we believe will meet the needs of the communities served by the facilities 
many of our hospitals also offer a wide range of clinical research studies  giving patients access to innovative care 
we are dedicated to helping our hospitals participate in medical research that is consistent with state and federal regulations and provides good clinical practice guidelines 
current clinical research programs relate to a wide array of ailments  including cardiovascular disease  pulmonary disease  musculoskeletal disorders  neurological disorders  genitourinary disease and various cancers  as well as medical device studies 
by supporting clinical research  our hospitals are actively involved in medical advancements that can lead to improvements in patient safety and clinical care 
each of our acute care hospitals is accredited by the joint commission formerly  the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or the american osteopathic association in the case of one hospital 
with such accreditation  our hospitals are deemed to meet the medicare conditions of participation and are eligible to participate in government sponsored provider programs  such as the medicare and medicaid programs

owned by a limited liability company in which a tenet subsidiary owned a interest at december  and is the managing member 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our hospitals were in florida  texas and california 
strong concentrations of hospital beds within market areas help us contract more successfully with managed care payers  reduce management  marketing and other expenses  and more efficiently utilize resources 
however  these concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other condition occur in these areas  our overall business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the following table presents the number of hospitals operated by our subsidiaries  as well as the total number of licensed beds at those facilities  at december   and december  total number of facilities total number of licensed beds includes all general hospitals and our critical access facility  as well as one facility at december  and that is classified in discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes as of december  information regarding utilization of licensed beds and other operating statistics can be found in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report

as part of this agreement  chi received a minority ownership interest in conifer 
in addition  in october  conifer acquired informed  llc informed  an information management and services company with extensive health care data and proprietary technology 
in november  conifer also acquired a hospital revenue cycle management business 
we began reporting conifer as a separate business segment for financial reporting purposes in the three months ended june  the loss of conifer s key customers  primarily tenet and chi  in the future could have a material adverse impact on the segment 
financial and other information about our conifer business segment is provided in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
real property description of real property the locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at december  are set forth in the table beginning on page at december   our subsidiaries also operated medical office buildings  all of which were located on  or nearby  our hospital campuses 
of those medical office buildings  were owned by our subsidiaries and seven were owned by third parties and leased by our subsidiaries 
our corporate headquarters are located in dallas  texas 
we have other corporate administrative offices in anaheim  california and coral springs  florida 
one of our subsidiaries leases our corporate headquarters space under an operating lease agreement that expires in december other subsidiaries lease the space for our offices in anaheim and coral springs under operating lease agreements 
conifer s headquarters are located in frisco  texas  and it also maintains offices in anaheim and encino  california  boca raton and st 
petersburg  florida  atlanta  georgia which office we are planning to close in and st 
louis  missouri 
one of conifer s subsidiaries leases its headquarters space under two operating lease agreements that expire in march and october  respectively 
in february  conifer entered into a new lease to consolidate its headquarters in one building  that lease  which is expected to be accounted for as a capital lease  is scheduled to commence in february and expire in february other conifer subsidiaries lease the space for its regional offices under operating lease agreements 
we 
table of contents believe that all of our properties  including the administrative and medical office buildings described above  are suitable for their intended purposes 
obligations relating to real property as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding loans secured by property and equipment 
in addition  from time to time  we lease real property to third party developers for the construction of medical office buildings 
under our current practice  the financing necessary to construct the medical office buildings encumbers only the leasehold and not our fee interest in the real estate 
in years past  however  we have at times subordinated our fee interest and allowed our property to be pledged as collateral for third party loans 
we have no contractual obligation to make payments on these third party loans  but our property could be subject to loss in the case of default by the lessee 
regulations affecting real property we are subject to a number of laws and regulations affecting our use of  and purchase and sale of  real property 
among these are california s seismic standards  the americans with disabilities act  and various environmental laws and regulations 
the state of california has established standards intended to ensure that all hospitals in the state withstand earthquakes and other seismic activity without collapsing or posing the threat of significant loss of life 
to date  we have spent a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations 
we do not expect to incur material additional costs  however  because all of our general acute care hospitals in california are now in compliance with the current seismic requirements 
in addition to safety standards  over time  hospitals must also meet performance standards meant to ensure that they are generally capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
ultimately  all general acute care hospitals in california must meet these seismic performance standards by to remain open 
we expect to meet california s seismic performance standards by the deadline  however  we are unable to estimate the cost of compliance at this time 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public accommodations  including hospitals and other health care facilities  be made accessible to disabled persons 
through december   we spent approximately million on corrective work to improve disability access at our facilities  and we expect to spend approximately million more on such improvements over the next three years pursuant to the terms of a negotiated consent decree 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations  including with respect to asbestos abatement and the treatment of underground storage tanks  among other matters 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of complying with such laws  rules and regulations will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
intellectual property conifer relies on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual terms and conditions to protect its intellectual property rights  and has sought patent protection for one of its key innovations 
legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of patents can be uncertain 
we do not know whether our pending patent application will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to further narrow our claims 
our patent application may not result in the grant of a patent with the scope of the claims that we seek  if at all  or the scope of the granted claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any patents that may be granted in the future from pending or future applications may be opposed  contested  circumvented  designed around by a third party or found to be invalid or unenforceable 
third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies  duplicate or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies  or design around patents owned or licensed by us 
conversely  if our technology is found to infringe any patent or other intellectual property right held by a third party  we could be prevented from providing our service offerings and could be subject to significant damage awards 
we also rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect our technology 
we control access to and the use of our application capabilities through a combination of internal and external controls 
we also license some of our software through agreements that impose specific restrictions on customers ability to use the software  such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies 
on occasion  we incorporate third party commercial or open source software products into our technology platform 
although we prefer to develop our own technology  we periodically employ third party software in order to simplify our development and maintenance efforts  provide a commodity capability  support our own technology infrastructure or test a new capability 

table of contents medical staff and employees general our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of individual hospitals 
under state laws and other licensing standards  hospital medical staffs are generally self governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the hospital s local governing board 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us 
members of our medical staffs are free to terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals are not our employees 
however  nurses  therapists  lab technicians  facility maintenance workers and the administrative staffs of hospitals normally are our employees 
we are subject to federal minimum wage and hour laws and various state labor laws  and maintain a number of different employee benefit plans 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs in each of the last three years  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are causing them to consider alternatives  including leaving private practice for employed physician arrangements  relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
we continue to take steps to successfully attract and retain key employees  qualified physicians and other health care professionals 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the number of our employees of which approximately were part time employees at december  was as follows hospital operations conifer administrative offices total includes employees whose employment related to the operations of our general hospitals  critical access facility  long term acute care hospital  outpatient centers  physician practices and other health care operations 
at december   the largest concentrations of our employees excluding employees in our administrative offices were in those states where we had the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds  as shown in the table below of employees of licensed beds florida california texas union activity and labor relations as of december   approximately of our employees were represented by various labor unions 
these employees primarily registered nurses and service and maintenance workers were located at of our hospitals  the majority of which are in california and florida 
we have no expired contracts at this time  however  we are in the process of negotiating new contracts where employees have recently chosen union representation 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from these agreements 
furthermore  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
ongoing organizing activities by labor unions could increase our level of union representation in shortage of experienced nurses and mandatory nurse staffing ratios in addition to union activity  factors that adversely affect our labor costs include the nationwide shortage of experienced nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain key specialties and geographic areas 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  
table of contents but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we continually monitor our nurse staffing ratios in california in an effort to achieve full compliance with the state mandated nurse staffing ratios there 
nurse staffing ratio legislation has been proposed in  but not yet enacted by  congress and other states besides california in which we operate hospitals  including florida and pennsylvania 
in  texas passed the hospital safe staffing law  which mandates the creation of nurse staffing committees at texas hospitals and outlines each hospital s responsibility to adopt  implement and enforce an official nurse staffing plan  but does not mandate staffing ratios 
also in  the missouri department of health and senior services adopted hospital nursing services regulations that are similar to the texas requirements with respect to nurse staffing 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience salary  wage and benefit pressures created by the shortage of experienced nurses throughout the country and state mandated nurse staffing ratios  particularly in california 
in response  we have increased our efforts to recruit and retain experienced nurses and also to address workforce development with local schools of nursing 
we expect that of our hospitals will participate in the versanttm rn residency program in by providing an to week residency program for new nursing school graduates to help ease the transition from student to professional practicing nurse  give nurses evidence based experience and skills needed to increase their competency and confidence  reduce first year nurse turnover and decrease the use of contract labor 
competition health care services overall  our hospitals  outpatient centers and other health care businesses operate in competitive environments  primarily at the local level 
generally  other hospitals and outpatient centers in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer  and  in some cases  competing facilities are more established or newer than ours 
furthermore  competing facilities may offer a broader array of services to patients and physicians than ours  may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer patients  may have a better reputation in the community  or may be more centrally located with better parking or closer proximity to public transportation 
we also face increased competition from specialty hospitals some of which are physician owned and unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
furthermore  some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
these tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in addition  in certain markets in which we operate  large teaching hospitals provide highly specialized facilities  equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals 
another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital or outpatient facility is the ability to negotiate contracts with managed care plans 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us 
other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into acceptable managed care contractual arrangements or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions 
for example  some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us 
moreover  state laws that require findings of need for construction and expansion of health care facilities or services as described in health care regulation and licensing certificate of need requirements below may also have the effect of restricting competition 
in addition  in those states that do not have certificate of need requirements or that do not require review of health care capital expenditure amounts below a relatively high threshold  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
our strategies are designed to help our hospitals remain competitive 
broadly speaking  we attract physicians by providing high quality care to our patients and otherwise creating an environment within which physicians prefer to practice 
one of our specific initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals and an increased number of our affiliated physicians in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which may result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have completed clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative tgi has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations 
however  the 
table of contents de emphasis or elimination of certain unprofitable service lines as a result of our tgi analyses will allow us to dedicate more resources on services that are in higher demand and are more profitable 
we have also increased our focus on operating our outpatient centers with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients  as well as increased predictability and efficiency for physicians 
our commitment to quality and medicare performance improvement initiatives are further helping position us competitively 
we continually work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care  while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs 
we believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
as a result of our efforts  our cms hospital compare core measures scores have consistently exceeded the national average since the end of  and the major national commercial payers have recognized our achievements relative to quality 
in general  we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs  increasing payments from medicare and certain managed care payers for our services  and increasing physician and patient satisfaction  which may improve our volumes 
further  each hospital has a local governing board  consisting primarily of community members and physicians  that develops short term and long term plans for the hospital to foster a desirable medical environment 
each local governing board also reviews and approves  as appropriate  actions of the medical staff  including staff appointments  credentialing  peer review and quality assurance 
while physicians may terminate their association with our hospitals at any time  we believe that by striving to maintain and improve the quality of care at our hospitals and by maintaining ethical and professional standards  we will attract and retain qualified physicians with a variety of specialties 
revenue cycle management solutions our conifer subsidiary faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management market 
in addition  the internal revenue cycle management staff of hospitals and other health care providers  who have historically performed many of the functions addressed by our services  in effect compete with us 
moreover  providers who have previously made investments in internally developed solutions sometimes choose to continue to rely on their own resources 
we also currently compete with several categories of external participants in the revenue cycle market  most of which focus on small components of the hospital revenue cycle  including software vendors and other technology supported revenue cycle management business process outsourcing companies  traditional consultants  either specialized health care consulting firms or health care divisions of large accounting firms  and large  non healthcare focused business process outsourcing and information technology outsourcing firms 
we believe that competition for the revenue cycle management and other services conifer provides is based primarily on knowledge and understanding of the complex public and private health care payment and reimbursement systems  a track record of delivering revenue improvements and efficiency gains for hospitals and other health care providers  the ability to deliver solutions that are fully integrated along each step of the revenue cycle  cost effectiveness  including the breakdown between up front costs and pay for performance incentive compensation  reliability  simplicity and flexibility of the technology platform  understanding of the health care industry s regulatory environment  sufficient infrastructure  and financial stability 
to be successful  conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards  regulations and customer requirements 
existing or new competitors may introduce technologies or services that render conifer s technologies or services obsolete or less marketable 
even if conifer s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors  current or potential customers might prefer competitive technologies or services to conifer s technologies and services 
furthermore  increased competition may result in pricing pressures  which could negatively impact conifer s margins  growth rate or market share 
health care regulation and licensing affordable care act the affordable care act was enacted to change how health care services in the united states are covered  delivered and reimbursed 
the primary goal of this comprehensive legislation is to extend health coverage to millions of uninsured legal 
table of contents us residents through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion 
to fund the expansion of insurance coverage  the legislation contains measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity  the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of uninsured patients who will obtain insurance coverage  uncertainty regarding future negotiations with payers  and gradual or potentially delayed implementation 
however  we expect that several provisions of the affordable care act  including those described below  will have a material effect on our business 
health insurance market reforms the affordable care act contains provisions requiring most americans to maintain  and employers to provide  minimal essential health insurance coverage 
for individuals who are not exempt from this individual mandate  and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program  the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company 
beginning in  those who do not comply with the individual mandate must make a shared responsibility payment to the federal government in the form of a tax penalty 
in june  the us supreme court upheld the individual mandate following the appeal of a lawsuit first filed in federal district court by states  several individuals and the national federation of independent business challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the affordable care act 
the law also establishes a number of health insurance market reforms  including bans on lifetime limits and pre existing condition exclusions  new benefit mandates  and increased dependent coverage 
specifically  group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual coverage plans may not establish lifetime limits or  beginning january   annual limits on the dollar value of benefits  may not rescind coverage of an enrollee  except in instances where the individual has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact  must reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place  and must continue to make dependent coverage available to unmarried dependents until age coverage for the dependents of unmarried adult children is not required effective for health plan policy years beginning on or after september  for plans that offer dependent coverage 
it is not clear what impact  if any  the increased obligations on managed care payers and other payers imposed by the affordable care act will have on our commercial managed care volumes and payment rates 
in addition  the affordable care act calls for states to establish health insurance exchanges  which are government regulated organizations that provide a competitive market for buying health insurance 
health insurance exchanges will offer individuals a choice of different health plans  certifying plans that participate and providing information to help consumers better understand their options 
states have the option of operating their own exchanges or partnering with the federal government to run an exchange 
states choosing neither option will default to a federally facilitated exchange 
all exchanges  regardless of how they are administered  must be ready to begin enrolling consumers into coverage on october  and must be fully operational on january  public program reforms the affordable care act expands eligibility under existing medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level beginning in further  the law permits states to create federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid 
however  the affordable care act also contains a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare and medicaid program spending by significant amounts  including negative adjustments to the annual input price index  or market basket  updates for medicare s inpatient  outpatient  long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems  which began in  as well as additional productivity adjustments  which began in  and reductions to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in federal fiscal year ffy as the number of uninsured individuals declines 
any reductions to our reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs by the affordable care act could adversely affect our business and results of operations to the extent such reductions are not offset by increased revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals 

table of contents the affordable care act  as enacted  penalized states that refused to comply with medicaid expansion with the possibility of losing of their federal medicaid funding 
however  the us supreme court struck down that provision in june following the appeal of the lawsuit discussed above challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the affordable care act 
the expansion of the medicaid program in each state will require state legislative action and the approval by cms of a state medicaid plan amendment 
there is no deadline for a state to undertake expansion and qualify for the enhanced federal funding available under the affordable care act 
we cannot provide any assurances as to whether or when the states in which we operate might choose to expand their medicaid programs 
the affordable care act also contains a number of provisions intended to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care provided to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
for example  the legislation expands payment penalties based on a hospital s rates of hospital acquired conditions hacs 
medicare has designated selected diagnoses as hacs 
these are conditions that would otherwise potentially result in a higher payment for an inpatient hospital discharge  but will not result in a higher payment if the condition is acquired during hospitalization ie  was not present on admission  as the case will be paid as though the secondary diagnosis is not present 
effective july   the affordable care act likewise prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hacs 
beginning in ffy  hospitals that fall into the top of national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will also receive a reduction in medicare payment rates 
for discharges occurring during ffys beginning on or after october   hospitals with excessive readmissions for certain conditions will receive reduced medicare payments for all inpatient admissions 
separately  under a medicare value based purchasing program that was launched in ffy  hospitals that satisfy certain performance standards will receive increased payments for discharges during the following fiscal year 
these payments will be funded by decreases in payments to all hospitals for inpatient services 
for discharges occurring during ffy and after  the performance standards must assess hospital efficiency  including medicare spending per beneficiary 
in addition  the affordable care act directed cms to launch a national pilot program to study the use of bundled payments to hospitals  physicians and post acute care providers relating to a single admission to promote collaboration and alignment on quality and efficiency improvement  implementation of the pilot program is currently ongoing through the center for medicare and medicaid innovation within cms  which has the authority to develop and test new payment methodologies designed to improve quality of care and lower costs 
in addition  the affordable care act contains provisions relating to recovery audit contractors racs  which are third party organizations under contract with cms that identify underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program and recoup any overpayments on behalf of the government 
the affordable care act expanded the rac program s scope to include medicaid claims and required all states to enter into contracts with racs 
other provisions the affordable care act contains a number of other additional provisions  including provisions relating to the medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments  section of the social security act commonly referred to as the stark law  and qui tam or whistleblower actions  each of which is described in detail below  as well as provisions regarding the creation of an independent payment advisory board that will make recommendations to congress regarding additional changes to provider payments and other aspects of the nation s health care system  and new taxes on manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical devices used by our hospitals  as well as a requirement that manufacturers file annual reports of payments made to physicians 
many of the law s provisions will not take effect until  while others became effective immediately or have become effective more recently 
many provisions also will require the federal government and individual state governments to interpret and implement the new requirements 
in particular  we are unable to predict the timing and impact of changes resulting from actions individual states have taken or might take with respect to expanding medicaid coverage at this time 
because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  the reductions in medicare and medicaid spending  and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us 
in addition  even after implementation of the affordable care act  we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care due to the failure of states to expand medicaid coverage as originally contemplated by the affordable care act and for undocumented aliens who will not be permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program 
moreover  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local health care regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents anti kickback and self referral regulations medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
specifically  the law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease  purchase or order of any item  good  facility or service covered by these programs 
in addition to addressing other matters  as discussed below  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa also amended title xi usc section et seq 
to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans  whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program 
moreover  the affordable care act amended the anti kickback statute to provide that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  under the affordable care act  submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal false claims act fca 
furthermore  it is a violation of the federal civil monetary penalties law to offer or transfer anything of value to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another 
many states have statutes similar to the federal anti kickback statute  except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third party payers  not just federal programs 
the federal government has also issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
these regulations are often referred to as the safe harbor regulations 
the fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
rather  such conduct and business arrangements may be subject to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and should be reviewed on a case by case basis 
although we seek to structure our business relationships to avoid any activity that could be construed to violate the anti kickback statute and similar laws  new payment structures  such as accountable care organizations and other arrangements involving combinations of hospitals  physicians and other providers who share payment savings could potentially be seen as implicating such laws 
in addition to the sanctions described above  any determination by a federal or state agency or court that we have violated any of these laws could give conifer s customers the right to terminate our services agreements with them 
moreover  any violations by and resulting penalties or exclusions imposed upon conifer s customers could adversely affect their financial condition and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on conifer s business and results of operations 
the stark law generally restricts referrals by physicians of medicare or medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless one of several exceptions applies 
the referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined designated health services  such as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  radiology  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the exceptions to the referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships 
these statutory  and the subsequent regulatory  exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships  relocation arrangements  leases  group practice arrangements  medical directorships  and other common relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as hospitals 
a violation of the stark law may result in a denial of payment  required refunds to patients and the medicare program  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  for sham arrangements  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each day that an entity fails to report required information  and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal programs 
in addition  the submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the stark law may constitute a false or fraudulent claim  and thus be subject to additional penalties under the fca 
many states have adopted self referral statutes similar to the stark law  some of which extend beyond the related state medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by the stark law and similar state enactments 
the affordable care act also made changes to the whole hospital exception in the stark law  effectively preventing new physician owned hospitals after march  and limiting the capacity and amount of physician ownership in existing physician owned hospitals 
as revised  the stark law prohibits physicians from referring medicare patients to a hospital in which they have an ownership or investment interest unless the hospital has physician ownership and a medicare provider agreement as of march  or  for those hospitals under development at the time of the affordable care act s enactment  as of 
table of contents december  
a physician owned hospital that meets these requirements will still be subject to restrictions that limit the hospital s aggregate physician ownership percentage and  with certain narrow exceptions for hospitals with a high percentage of medicaid patients  prohibit expansion of the number of operating rooms  procedure rooms or beds 
the legislation also subjects a physician owned hospital to reporting requirements and extensive disclosure requirements on the hospital s website and in any public advertisements 
as of december   two of our hospitals are owned by joint ventures that include some physician owners and are subject to the limitations and requirements in the affordable care act on physician owned hospitals 
in accordance with our ethics and compliance program  which is described in detail under compliance and ethics below  we have policies and procedures in place concerning compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  among others 
in addition  our ethics and compliance  law and audit services departments systematically review a substantial number of our arrangements with referral sources to determine the extent to which they comply with our policies and procedures and with the anti kickback statute  the stark law and similar state statutes 
health insurance portability and accountability act title ii  subtitle f of the health insurance portability and accountability act mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information 
hipaa s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the health care industry 
to protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity  hipaa also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information phi 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed 
the law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
to receive reimbursement from cms for electronic claims  health care providers must use hipaa s electronic data transmission transaction and code set standards when transmitting certain health care information electronically 
our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current standards 
in january  cms published a final rule changing the formats used for certain electronic transactions and requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as icd code sets 
at this time  use of the icd code sets is not mandatory until october  nonetheless  we have begun modifying our payment systems and processes to prepare for icd implementation 
although use of the icd code sets will require significant administrative changes  we believe that the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or revenues 
however  we may experience a short term adverse impact on our cash flows due to claims processing delays related to payer implementation of the new code sets 
furthermore  the affordable care act requires the us department of health and human services hhs to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction 
under hipaa  covered entities must establish administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality  integrity and availability of electronic phi maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf 
the covered entities we operate are in material compliance with the privacy  security and national provider identifier requirements of hipaa 
in addition  most of conifer s customers are covered entities  and conifer is a business associate to many of those customers under hipaa as a result of its contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of and provide certain services to those customers 
as a business associate  conifer s use and disclosure of phi is restricted by hipaa and the business associate agreements conifer is required to enter into with its covered entity customers 
in  hipaa was amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act to impose certain of the hipaa privacy and security requirements directly upon business associates of covered entities and significantly increase the monetary penalties for violations of hipaa 
regulations that took effect in late also require business associates such as conifer to notify covered entities  who in turn must notify affected individuals and government authorities  of data security breaches involving unsecured phi 
since the passage of the hitech act  enforcement of hipaa violations has increased 
a knowing breach of the hipaa privacy and security requirements made applicable to business associates by the hitech act could expose conifer to criminal liability  and a breach of safeguards and processes that is not due to reasonable cause or involves willful neglect could expose conifer to significant civil penalties and the possibility of civil litigation under hipaa and applicable state law 
in may  the office for civil rights of hhs proposed new regulations to implement changes to the hipaa requirements set forth in the hitech act that state that covered entities and business associates must account for disclosures of phi to carry out treatment  payment and health care operations if such disclosures are through an electronic health record 
the proposed regulations seek to expand the scope of the requirements under the hitech act and create a new patient right to an access report  which would be required to list every person who has accessed  for any reason  phi about the individual 
table of contents contained in any electronic designated record set 
because our hospitals currently utilize multiple  independent modules that may meet the definition of electronic designated record set  our ability to produce an access report that satisfies the proposed regulatory requirements would likely require new technology solutions to map across those multiple record sets 
it is our understanding that many providers have expressed significant concerns to cms regarding the access report requirement created by the proposed rule 
on january   hhs issued final regulations modifying the requirements set forth in the hitech act 
while we anticipate that we will be in full compliance with the new regulations before the compliance date of september   the new regulations do not address the proposed access report requirement 
because we cannot predict the requirements of the final rule regarding access reports  we are unable to estimate the costs of compliance  if any  at this time 
we have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with hipaa  and similar state privacy laws  under the guidance of our ethics and compliance department 
hospital and conifer compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our hipaa privacy and security policies and procedures at our hospitals and conifer 
we have also created an internal web based hipaa training program  which is mandatory for all employees 
based on existing regulations and our experience with hipaa to this point  we continue to believe that the ongoing costs of complying with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
government enforcement efforts and qui tam lawsuits both federal and state government agencies continue heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts against the health care industry 
the operational mission of the office of inspector general oig of hhs is to protect the integrity of the medicare and medicaid programs and the well being of program beneficiaries by detecting and preventing waste  fraud and abuse  identifying opportunities to improve program economy  efficiency and effectiveness  and holding accountable those who do not meet program requirements or who violate federal laws 
the oig carries out its mission by conducting audits  evaluations and investigations and  when appropriate  imposing civil monetary penalties  assessments and administrative sanctions 
although we have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance in all material respects with the laws  rules and regulations affecting the health care industry  if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
health care providers are also subject to qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits under the federal false claims act  which allows private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the fca defines the term knowingly broadly 
though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the fca  submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the fca and  therefore  will qualify for liability 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the fca by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
under the affordable care act  the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due  whichever is later  constitutes a violation of the fca 
further  the affordable care act expands the scope of the fca to cover payments in connection with health insurance exchanges if those payments include any federal funds 
qui tam actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves medicaid funds or funding from state and local agencies 
like other companies in the health care industry  we are subject to qui tam actions from time to time  however  we are unable to predict the future impact of such actions on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care facility licensing requirements in order to maintain their operating licenses  health care facilities must comply with strict governmental standards concerning medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our health care facilities hold all required governmental approvals  licenses and permits material to the operation of their business 

table of contents utilization review compliance and hospital governance in addition to certain statutory coverage limits and exclusions  federal laws and regulations  specifically the medicare conditions of participation  generally require health care providers  including hospitals that furnish or order health care services that may be paid for under the medicare program or state health care programs  to ensure that claims for reimbursement are for services or items that are provided economically and only when  and to the extent  they are medically reasonable and necessary  of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care  and supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality 
the social security act established the utilization and quality control peer review organization program  now known as the quality improvement organization qio program  to promote the effectiveness  efficiency  economy and quality of services delivered to medicare beneficiaries and to ensure that those services are reasonable and necessary 
cms administers the qio program through a network of qios that work with consumers  physicians  hospitals and other caregivers to refine care delivery systems to ensure patients receive the appropriate care at the appropriate time  particularly among underserved populations 
the qio program also safeguards the integrity of the medicare trust fund by reviewing medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges  and ensuring payment is made only for medically necessary services  and investigates beneficiary complaints about quality of care 
the qios have the authority to deny payment for services provided and recommend to hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with certain standards be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff doctors at each of our health care facilities  are overseen by each facility s local governing board  the members of which primarily are community members and physicians  and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel 
the local hospital governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care  develop short term and long range plans  and establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  as well as approves the credentials  disciplining and  if necessary  the termination of privileges of medical staff members 
certificate of need requirements some states require state approval for construction  expansion and closure of health care facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over health care facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
as of december   we operated hospitals in seven states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals 
we are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where they are required  or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and  thereby  affect our competitive position 
in those states that do not have certificate of need requirements or that do not require review of health care capital expenditure amounts below a relatively high threshold  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
environmental matters our health care operations are subject to a number of federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations that govern  among other things  our disposal of solid waste  as well as our use  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous and toxic materials including radiological materials 
our operations also generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with laws and regulations that vary from state to state 
in addition  although we are not engaged in manufacturing or other activities that produce meaningful levels of greenhouse gas emissions  our operating expenses could be adversely affected if legal and regulatory developments related to climate change or other initiatives result in increased energy or other costs 
we could also be affected by climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy or result in severe weather or climate change events affecting the communities in which our facilities are located 
at this time  based on current climate conditions and our assessment of existing and pending environmental rules and regulations  as well as treaties and international accords relating to climate change  we do not believe that the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  including regulations relating to climate change issues  will have a material adverse effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or cash flows 
consistent with our commitment to meet the highest standards of corporate responsibility  we have formed a sustainability committee consisting of corporate and hospital leaders to regularly evaluate our environmental outcomes and share best practices among our hospitals and other facilities 
in  we published our second annual sustainability report  using the industry standard global reporting initiative framework 
in addition  we are a sponsor of the healthier hospitals initiative and will work with each of our hospitals in adopting components of the initiative s agenda  which focuses on improvements in sustainability governance  the provision of healthier foods  energy consumption  waste generation  the use of 
table of contents safer chemicals and purchasing decisions 
we are committed to report the results of our sustainability efforts on an annual basis 
regulations affecting conifer debt collection activities the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect  directly or indirectly  consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person 
certain of the accounts receivable handled by conifer s debt collection agency subsidiary  syndicated office systems  llc sos  are subject to the fdcpa  which establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors  including the time  place and manner of such communications 
further  the fdcpa prohibits harassment or abuse by debt collectors  including the threat of violence or criminal prosecution  obscene language or repeated telephone calls made with the intent to abuse or harass 
the fdcpa also places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt and sets forth specific procedures to be followed when communicating with such third parties for purposes of obtaining location information about the consumer 
in addition  the fdcpa contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors 
finally  the fdcpa imposes certain limitations on lawsuits to collect debts against consumers 
debt collection activities are also regulated at state level 
most states have laws regulating debt collection activities in ways that are similar to  and in some cases more stringent than  the fdcpa 
in certain situations  the activities of sos are also subject to the fair credit reporting act fcra  which regulates consumer credit reporting and which may impose liability on us to the extent that the adverse credit information reported on a consumer to a credit bureau is false or inaccurate 
state law  to the extent it is not preempted by the fcra  may also impose restrictions or liability on us with respect to reporting adverse credit information 
the us federal trade commission has the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to the fdcpa and the fcra  and to initiate or recommend enforcement actions  including actions to seek monetary penalties 
state officials typically have authority to enforce corresponding state laws 
in addition  affected consumers may bring suits  including class action suits  to seek monetary remedies including statutory damages for violations of the federal and state provisions discussed above 
in july  the president signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act into law 
under the dodd frank act  a new consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was formed within the us federal reserve to promulgate regulations to promote transparency  simplicity  fairness  accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services  including debt collection services 
the legislation gives significant discretion to the cfpb in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent to which the operations of sos could be affected by these developments 
credit card activities conifer accepts payments by credit cards from patients of its customers 
various federal and state laws impose privacy and information security laws and regulations with respect to the use of credit cards 
if conifer fails to comply with these laws and regulations or experiences a credit card security breach  its reputation could be damaged  possibly resulting in lost business  and it could be subjected to additional legal or financial risk as a result of non compliance 
compliance and ethics general our ethics and compliance department maintains our multi faceted  values based ethics and compliance program  which is designed to help staff in our corporate and conifer offices  hospitals  outpatient centers and physician practices meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations  as well as industry practice  and monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and others  and stress the importance of understanding and complying with our standards of conduct 
the ethics and compliance department operates with independence it has its own operating budget  it has the authority to hire outside counsel  access any tenet document and interview any of our personnel  and our chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 

table of contents program charter following the expiration of our five year corporate integrity agreement the cia with the oig in september  the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors approved an updated quality  compliance and ethics program charter intended to continue certain of the safeguards implemented by the cia and  among other things support and maintain our present and future responsibilities with regard to participation in federal health care programs  and further our goals of fostering and maintaining the highest ethical standards among all employees  officers and directors  physicians practicing at tenet facilities and contractors that furnish health care items or services  and valuing our compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations as a foundation of our corporate philosophy 
the primary focus of our quality  compliance and ethics program is compliance with the requirements of medicare  medicaid and other federally funded health care programs 
pursuant to the terms of the charter  our ethics and compliance department is responsible for the following activities annually assessing  critiquing and as appropriate drafting and distributing company policies and procedures  developing  providing and tracking ethics training for all employees  directors  contractors and agents  developing  providing and tracking job specific training to those who work in clinical quality  coding  billing  cost reporting and referral source arrangements  developing  providing and tracking annual training on ethics and clinical quality oversight to the members of each hospital governing board  creating and disseminating the company s standards of conduct and obtaining certifications of adherence to the standards of conduct as a condition of employment  maintaining and promoting tenet s ethics action line  which allows confidential reporting of issues on an anonymous basis and emphasizes tenet s no retaliation policy  responding to and resolving all compliance related issues that arise from the ethics action line and compliance reports received from our facilities  hospital compliance officers or any other source  ensuring that appropriate corrective and disciplinary actions are taken when non compliant conduct or improper contractual relationships are identified  monitoring and measuring the company s adherence to all applicable tenet policies and legal and regulatory requirements related to federal health care programs  directing an annual screening of individuals for exclusion from federal health care program participation as required by federal regulations  maintaining a database of all arrangements involving the payment of anything of value between tenet and any physician or other actual or potential source of health care business or referrals to or from tenet  and overseeing annual audits of clinical quality  referral source arrangements  outliers  charging  coding  billing and other compliance risk areas as may be identified from time to time

the standards reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies  procedures and practices 
our standards cover such areas as quality patient care  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  appropriate use of our assets  protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest 
as part of the program  we provide annual training sessions to every employee  as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors 
all employees are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the standards of conduct  and are encouraged to contact our hour toll free ethics action line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns

table of contents property and professional and general liability insurance property insurance we have property  business interruption and related insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of catastrophic events or perils that is subject to deductible provisions based on the terms of the policies 
these policies are on an occurrence basis 
for the policy periods april  through march  and april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding floods  earthquakes and windstorms  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values up to a maximum of million for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  and of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  with a maximum per claim deductible of million 
other covered losses  including fires and other perils  have a minimum deductible of million 
professional and general liability insurance as is typical in the health care industry  we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional liability insurance due to increased litigation 
in response  we formed and maintain captive insurance companies to self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability risk 
claims in excess of our self insurance retentions are insured with commercial insurance companies 
for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
our captive insurance company  the healthcare insurance corporation thinc  retains million per occurrence coverage above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
the next million of claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are reinsured by thinc with independent reinsurance companies  with thinc retaining or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
for the policy period june  through may   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred 
thinc retains million per occurrence coverage above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
the next million of claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are reinsured by thinc with independent reinsurance companies  with thinc retaining or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies with major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
if the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted  in whole or in part  it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
in addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries  we maintain reserves  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  for our self insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies aggregate limits  based on actuarial estimates of losses and related expenses 
also  we provide standby letters of credit to certain of our insurers  which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances  to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations 
if one or more of the events discussed in the following risks were to occur  actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the sec  and our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected  furthermore  the trading price of our common stock could decline and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain managed care contractual arrangements on acceptable terms  if we experience material reductions in the contracted rates we receive from managed care payers or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the year ended december  was billion  which represented approximately of our total net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
in the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
in addition  at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable were due from managed care payers 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us 
other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into acceptable managed care contractual arrangements or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions 
for example  some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us 
furthermore  managed care payers are continuing to demand discounted fee structures  and the trend toward consolidation among these payers tends to increase their bargaining power 
in some cases  commercial managed care payers rely on all or portions of medicare s severity adjusted diagnosis related group system to 
table of contents determine payment rates  which could result in decreased reimbursement from some of these payers if levels of payments to health care providers or payment methodologies under the medicare program are changed 
other changes to government health care programs  such as the increased obligations on managed care payers imposed by the affordable care act  may negatively impact commercial managed care volumes and payment rates from managed care payers 
any material reductions in the contracted rates we receive for our services  coupled with any difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect that the affordable care act may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the affordable care act was enacted to change how health care services in the united states are covered  delivered and reimbursed 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the law may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
on the other hand  the affordable care act provides for significant reductions in the growth of medicare spending and reductions in medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments 
a substantial portion of both our patient volumes and  as result  our revenues is derived from government health care programs  principally medicare and medicaid 
reductions to our reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs by the affordable care act could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in june  the us supreme court upheld the affordable care act s individual mandate and struck down its penalties for states that refused to comply with medicaid expansion provisions 
we remain unable to predict with certainty the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity and the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the law 
furthermore  many of the provisions of the affordable care act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until or later 
in addition  the affordable care act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to participate in medicaid expansion and the grants and other incentive opportunities under the law  and we are unable to predict the timing and impact of changes resulting from actions individual states have taken or might take with respect to expanding medicaid coverage at this time 
in general  there is significant uncertainty with respect to the positive and negative effects the affordable care act may have on reimbursement  utilization and the future designs of provider networks and insurance plans including pricing  provider participation  coverage  co pays and deductibles  and the multiple models that attempt to predict those effects may differ materially from our expectations 
further changes in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government health care programs could have an adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts were related to the medicare program  and approximately of our net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts were related to various state medicaid programs  in each case excluding medicare and medicaid managed care programs 
in addition to the changes affected by the affordable care act  the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to other statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities  which could in turn adversely affect our overall business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
any material adverse effects resulting from future reductions in payments from government programs could be exacerbated if we are not able to manage our operating costs effectively 
moreover  the economic downturn has increased budget pressures on most states  and these budget pressures have resulted  and likely will continue to result  in decreased spending for medicaid programs in many states 
most states began a new fiscal year on july  and  although most addressed projected shortfalls in their final budgets  some states are still facing budget gaps 
increased medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn  limits on the ability of states to reduce medicaid eligibility criteria enacted as part of the affordable care act  budget gaps and other factors could result in future reductions to medicaid payments or additional taxes on hospitals 
some states are considering proposals that would result in such reductions 
in general  we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents our business continues to be adversely affected by a high volume of uninsured and underinsured patients  as well as declines in commercial managed care patients 
like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with increased burdens of co payments and deductibles due to changes in their health care plans 
as a result  we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients as a result of the affordable care act or otherwise  the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  or the economy improves and unemployment rates decline  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase 
in addition  even after implementation of the affordable care act  we may continue to experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program 
over the past several years  we have experienced declines in our commercial managed care volumes  which in the aggregate generate substantially higher yields than medicare and medicaid volumes 
the declines in our commercial managed care volumes are due  in part  to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment 
in addition  we believe that the growth in high deductible health plans has adversely impacted commercial managed care volumes 
our hospitals  outpatient centers and other health care businesses operate in competitive environments  and competition is one reason increases in patient volumes have been constrained 
overall  our hospitals  outpatient centers and other health care businesses operate in competitive environments  and we believe increases in patient volumes have been constrained  in part  by competition for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
generally  other hospitals and outpatient centers in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer  and  in some cases  competing facilities are more established or newer than ours 
furthermore  competing facilities may offer a broader array of services to patients and physicians than ours  may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer patients  may have more favorable contracts with managed care plans  may have a better reputation in the community  or may be more centrally located with better parking or closer proximity to public transportation 
we also face increased competition from specialty hospitals some of which are physician owned and unaffiliated freestanding outpatient centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
furthermore  some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
these tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in addition  in certain markets in which we operate  large teaching hospitals provide highly specialized facilities  equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals 
if competing health care providers are better able to attract patients  recruit and retain physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  our patient volume levels may suffer 
if we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  our business may suffer 
the success of our business depends in significant part on the number  quality and specialties of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  the admitting practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets we serve  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals 
such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are causing them to consider alternatives  including leaving private practice for employed physician arrangements  relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of quality physicians by providing adequate support personnel  technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients  physicians may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities  admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
our labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing  the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity 
our hospital operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel  including nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians  as well as our employed physicians 
we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining physicians and qualified management responsible for the daily operations of our hospitals 
in addition  like others in the health care industry  we continue to experience a shortage of experienced nurses in certain 
table of contents key specialties and geographic areas 
as a result  from time to time  we may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain experienced nurses or hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel 
furthermore  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of experienced nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
in general  our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  experienced nurses and other medical support personnel  or to control labor costs  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
increased labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs 
at december   approximately of our employees were represented by various labor unions 
these employees primarily registered nurses and service and maintenance workers were located at of our hospitals  the majority of which are in california and florida 
we have no expired contracts at this time  however  we are in the process of negotiating new contracts where employees have recently chosen union representation 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from these agreements 
furthermore  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
ongoing organizing activities by labor unions could increase our level of union representation in  to the extent a greater portion of our employee base unionizes  it is possible our labor costs could increase materially 
conifer s future success also depends in part on our ability to attract  hire  integrate and retain key personnel 
competition for the caliber and number of employees we require at conifer is intense 
we may face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure 
in addition  we invest significant time and expense in training conifer s employees  which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them 
if we fail to retain our conifer employees  we could incur significant expenses in hiring  integrating and training their replacements  and the quality of conifer s services and its ability to serve its customers could diminish  resulting in a material adverse effect on that segment of our business 
our licensed hospital beds are heavily concentrated in certain market areas in florida  texas and california  which makes us sensitive to economic  regulatory  environmental and other conditions in those areas 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our hospitals were in florida  texas and california 
these concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other condition occur in these areas  our overall business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration  and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover our losses 
in the past  hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida and texas and the patient populations in those states 
our california operations could be adversely affected by a major earthquake or wildfires in that state 
our business and financial results could be harmed by violations of existing regulations or compliance with new or changed regulations 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  licensure  conduct of operations  privacy of patient information  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
if a determination is made that we were in violation of such laws  rules or regulations  we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  conifer s failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to it could result in reduced demand for its services  invalidate all or portions of some of conifer s services agreements with its customers  or give customers the right to terminate conifer s services agreements with them  among other things  any of which could have an adverse effect on conifer s business 
even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of law could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and our business reputation could suffer 
furthermore  health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are also required to comply with various federal and state labor laws  rules and regulations governing a variety of workplace wage and hour issues 
from time to time  we have been and expect to continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and private litigation concerning our application of such laws  rules and regulations 

table of contents the failure to comply with debt collection and consumer credit reporting regulations could subject conifer s sos subsidiary to fines and other liabilities  which could harm conifer s reputation and business  and could make it more difficult for conifer to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
the fair debt collection practices act regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect  directly or indirectly  consumer debts in default that are owed or asserted to be owed to another person 
certain of the accounts receivable handled by sos  conifer s debt collection agency subsidiary  are subject to the fdcpa 
many states impose additional requirements on debt collection communications  and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements 
moreover  regulations governing debt collection are subject to changing interpretations that may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions 
sos could incur costs or could be subject to fines or other penalties under the fdcpa  the fair credit reporting act and the federal trade commission act if it is determined to have mishandled protected information 
we or conifer s customers could be required to report such breaches to affected consumers or regulatory authorities  leading to disclosures that could damage conifer s reputation  making it more difficult to retain existing customers or attract new customers  or otherwise harm conifer s business 
we could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant legal actions 
we are subject to medical malpractice lawsuits  class action lawsuits and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
some of these actions may involve large demands  as well as substantial defense costs 
even in states that have imposed caps on damages  litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to such caps 
our professional and general liability insurance does not cover all claims against us  and it may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain at adequate levels  as the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of such insurance due to increased litigation 
we cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs 
additionally  all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations 
if the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted  in whole or in part  it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
furthermore  one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or their obligations to defend  pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due 
in that case or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
conifer operates in a highly competitive industry  and its current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than conifer does  which could have a material adverse effect on conifer s business  revenue  growth rate and market share 
we intend to continue expanding conifer s revenue cycle management  patient communications services and management services businesses by marketing these services to non tenet hospitals and other health care related entities 
however  the market for conifer s solutions is highly competitive  and we expect competition may intensify in the future 
conifer faces competition from existing participants and new entrants to the revenue cycle management market including software vendors and other technology supported revenue cycle management outsourcing companies  traditional consultants and information technology outsourcing firms  as well as from the internal staffs of hospitals and other health care providers who  as described above  handle these processes internally 
to be successful  conifer must respond more quickly and effectively than its competitors to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards  regulations and customer requirements 
moreover  existing or new competitors may introduce technologies or services that render conifer s technologies or services obsolete or less marketable 
even if conifer s technologies and services are more effective than the offerings of its competitors  current or potential customers might prefer competitive technologies or services to conifer s technologies and services 
furthermore  increased competition may result in pricing pressures  which could negatively impact conifer s margins  growth rate or market share 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats  catastrophic events and other disruptions affecting our information technology and related systems 
as a provider of health care services  we rely on our information technology in the day to day operation of our business to process  transmit and store sensitive or confidential data  including electronic health records  other protected health information  and financial  payment and other personal data of patients  as well as to store our proprietary and confidential business performance data 
our centralized information technology delivery model supports all of our hospitals  outpatient centers and other health care businesses  including conifer 
we utilize a diversified data and voice network  along with technology systems for billing  supply chain  clinical information systems and labor management 
although we have redundancies and other measures 
table of contents designed to protect the security and availability of the data we process  transmit and store  our information technology and infrastructure is vulnerable to computer viruses  attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance 
furthermore  our network and technology systems are subject to disruption due to events such as a major earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event 
any such breach or system interruption could result in the unauthorized disclosure  misuse or loss of confidential  sensitive or proprietary information  could negatively impact our ability to conduct normal business operations including the collection of revenues  and could result in potential liability and damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the economic downturn and other economic factors have impacted  and may continue to impact  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to be impacted by a number of industry wide challenges  including constrained growth in patient volumes and high levels of bad debt 
we believe factors associated with the economic downturn including higher levels of unemployment  reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  and patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and non emergency health care procedures have impacted our volumes and affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
if industry trends or general economic conditions worsen  we may not be able to sustain future profitability  and our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed 
furthermore  the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide has been limited in recent years 
our ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets  which could have a negative impact on our growth plans  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions  and our ability to refinance existing debt 
the economic downturn or other economic conditions could also adversely affect the counterparties to our agreements  including the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may require us to record charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of factors that have negatively affected our industry generally and our business specifically  we have been required to record various charges in our results of operations 
our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining operating results in our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospitals most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  future impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill 
any such charges could adversely affect our results of operations 
the amount and terms of our current and any future debt could  among other things  adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total long term debt  as well as approximately million in standby letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of all of our wholly owned acute care and specialty hospitals 
from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
the terms and conditions in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and senior secured notes  as well as our payment obligations under these agreements  could have important consequences to our business and to holders of our securities  including the following our credit agreement and the indentures contain  and any future debt obligations may contain  covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain a financial ratio relating to our ability to satisfy certain fixed expenses  including interest payments 
the indentures contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens  consummate asset sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions or consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our or their assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business  in the health care industry or in the economy generally  or if federal or state governments set further limitations on reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs 

table of contents we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for our operations  capital expenditures or acquisitions 
we have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to the restrictions contained in our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and senior secured notes 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
because of net operating losses we have experienced for federal income tax purposes  at december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion pretax available to offset future taxable income 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period 
these ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs  the offering of stock by us  the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders  as defined in the treasury regulations  or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock 
if such ownership changes by shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed percentage points during the three year period  then section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by our nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change 
the limitation may affect the amount of our deferred income tax asset and  depending on the limitation  a significant portion of our nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards could expire before we are able to use them 
in such an event  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we believe that we have not experienced an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code as of february   however  the amount by which our ownership may change in the future could be affected by purchases and sales of stock by shareholders  purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs and new issuances of stock by us  should we choose to do so

joint venture with john muir health in january  we announced the creation of a joint venture partnership between our san ramon regional medical center and john muir health  a not for profit integrated system of doctors  hospitals and other health care services in the san francisco bay area 
through this partnership  john muir health will invest approximately million to acquire a ownership interest in san ramon regional medical center 
strategy and trends we are committed to providing the communities our hospitals  outpatient centers and other health care facilities serve with high quality  cost effective health care while growing our business  increasing our profitability and creating long term value for our shareholders 
we believe that our success in increasing our profitability depends in part on our success in executing the strategies and managing the trends discussed below 
core business strategy our business is focused on providing high quality care to patients through our hospitals and outpatient centers  and providing business process solutions for health care providers through our conifer business 
with respect to our hospitals and outpatient facilities  we seek to offer superior quality and patient services to meet community needs  to make capital and other investments in our facilities and technology to remain competitive  to recruit and retain physicians  to expand our outpatient business  and to negotiate favorable contracts with managed care and other commercial payers 
with respect to business process services  we provide comprehensive operational management for revenue cycle functions  including patient access  health information management  revenue integrity and patient financial services 
we also offer patient communications solutions to optimize the relationship between providers and patients 
in addition  our management services offerings have expanded to support value based performance through clinical integration  financial risk management and population health management 
development strategies we remain focused on opportunities to increase our hospital and outpatient revenues through organic growth and acquisitions  and to expand our conifer business 
from time to time  we build new hospitals  make strategic acquisitions of hospitals and enter into joint venture arrangements or affiliations with health care businesses in each case in markets where we believe our operating strategies can improve performance and create shareholder value 
we recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire the emanuel medical center in turlock  california 
in addition  we are creating a joint venture partnership with john muir health  a not for profit integrated system of doctors  hospitals and other health care services in the san francisco bay area  through which john muir health will invest approximately million to acquire a ownership interest in san ramon regional medical center 
historically  our outpatient services have generated significantly higher margins for us than inpatient services 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately of our net patient revenues from outpatient services 
by expanding our outpatient business  we expect to increase our profitability over time 
we believe that growth by strategic acquisitions  when and if opportunities are available  can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets 
we continually evaluate collaboration opportunities with outpatient facilities  health care providers  physician groups and others in our markets to maximize effectiveness  reduce costs and build clinically integrated networks that provide quality service across the care continuum 
we intend to continue expanding conifer s revenue cycle management  patient communications services and management services businesses by marketing these services to non tenet hospitals and other health care related entities 
conifer provides services to more than tenet and non tenet hospital and other clients nationwide 
we believe this business has the potential over time to generate high margins and improve our results of operations 
in may  conifer entered into a year agreement with catholic health initiatives chi to provide revenue cycle services for over of chi s hospitals 
as part of this agreement  chi received a minority ownership interest in conifer 
in addition  in october and november  conifer acquired an information management and services company and a hospital revenue cycle management business  respectively 
our service offerings have also recently expanded to support value based performance through clinical integration  financial risk management and population health management  which are integral parts of the health care industry s movement toward accountable care organizations acos and similar risk based or capitated contract models 
in addition to hospitals  other clients for these services include health plans  self insured employees and other entities 
commitment to quality we have made significant investments in the last decade in equipment  technology  education and operational strategies designed to improve clinical quality at our hospitals and outpatient centers 
as a result of our efforts  our cms hospital compare core measures scores have consistently exceeded the national average since the end of  and the major national commercial payers have also recognized our achievements relative to quality 
these designations are expected to become increasingly important as the commercial market moves to narrow networks and other methods designed to 
table of contents encourage covered individuals to use certain facilities over others 
through our commitment to quality and medicare performance improvement initiatives  we continually work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based medicine techniques to improve the way we provide care  while using labor management tools and supply chain initiatives to reduce variable costs 
we believe the use of these practices will promote the most effective and efficient utilization of resources and result in shorter lengths of stay  as well as reductions in redundant ancillary services and readmissions for hospitalized patients 
in general  we believe that quality of care improvements may have the effect of reducing costs  increasing payments from medicare and certain managed care payers for our services  and increasing physician and patient satisfaction  which may improve our volumes 
realizing hit incentive payments and other benefits beginning in the year ended december   we achieved compliance with certain of the health information technology hit requirements under the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  as a result  we recognized approximately million of electronic health record ehr incentives related to medicaid arra hit in in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we recognized approximately million of medicare and medicaid ehr incentives in our consolidated statement of operations in the year ended december  these incentives partially offset the operating expenses we have incurred and continue to incur to invest in hit systems 
furthermore  we believe that the operational benefits of hit  including improved clinical outcomes and increased operating efficiencies  will contribute to our long term ability to grow our business 
general economic conditions we believe that high unemployment rates and other adverse economic conditions are continuing to have a negative impact on our bad debt expense levels and patient volumes 
however  as the economy recovers  we expect to experience improvements in these metrics relative to current levels 
improving operating leverage we are experiencing an increase in our adjusted patient admissions that we believe is primarily attributable to our focus on physician alignment and satisfaction  targeted capital spending on critical growth opportunities for our hospitals  emphasis on higher demand clinical service lines including outpatient lines  focus on expanding our outpatient business  the implementation of new payer contracting strategies  and improved quality metrics at our hospitals 
increases in patient volumes have been constrained by the slow pace of the current economic recovery  increased competition  utilization pressure by managed care organizations  the effects of higher patient co pays and deductibles  and demographic trends 
we continue to pursue integrated contracting models that maximize our system wide skills and capabilities in conjunction with our strong market positions to accommodate new payment models 
we are also committed to a clinical alignment strategy  which includes an emphasis on physician employment and on innovative arrangements with payers  physicians and other providers 
for example  during  we successfully completed our first year of operation of an aco in northern california with roughly  blue shield members as part of an integrated health care delivery system designed to compete with offerings from other providers in the local market 
in several other markets  we have formed clinical integration organizations  which are collaborations with independent physicians and hospitals to develop ongoing clinical initiatives designed to control costs and improve the quality of care delivered to patients 
these achievements provide a foundation for negotiating with plans under an aco structure or other risk sharing model 
impact of affordable care act we anticipate that we will benefit over time from the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of affordable care act that will extend insurance coverage through medicaid or private insurance to a broader segment of the us population 
although we are unable to predict the precise impact of the affordable care act on our future results of operations  and while there will be some reductions in reimbursement rates  which began in  we anticipate  based on the current timetable for implementing the law  that we should begin to receive reimbursement for caring for uninsured and underinsured patients as early as our ability to execute on these strategies and manage these trends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from expectations 
for information about these risks and uncertainties  see the forward looking statements and risk factors sections in part i of this report 
results of operations overview our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide and company specific challenges  including constrained volume growth  lower patient acuity levels for certain patient service lines  and high levels of bad debt  that have affected our revenue growth and operating expenses 
we believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect recent trends we are experiencing with respect to volumes  revenues and expenses  therefore  we have provided below information about these metrics for the three months ended december  and for all of our continuing operations hospitals  excluding the results of our creighton university medical center  which has been reclassified to discontinued operations

the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  utilization of licensed beds represents patient days divided by number of days in the period divided by average licensed beds 
total admissions were flat in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  total surgeries increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in  comprised of a increase in outpatient surgeries partially offset by a decrease in inpatient surgeries 
our emergency department admissions increased in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
we believe the current economic conditions continue to have an adverse impact on the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals  which constrained the overall change in our total admissions 
charity and uninsured admissions increased in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  three months ended december  outpatient visits increase decrease total visits paying visits excludes charity and uninsured charity and uninsured visits emergency department visits surgery visits paying visits as a percentage of total visits charity and uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  total outpatient visits increased  or  in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  all four of our regions reported increased outpatient visits in the three months ended december   with the strongest growth occurring in our california region 
outpatient surgery visits increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in charity and uninsured outpatient visits increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  
table of contents three months ended december  revenues increase decrease net operating revenues revenues from the uninsured net inpatient revenues net outpatient revenues net inpatient revenues and net outpatient revenues are components of net operating revenues 
net inpatient revenues include self pay revenues of million and million for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
net outpatient revenues include self pay revenues of million and million for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
net operating revenues increased by million  or  in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in net operating revenues in the three months ended december  included million of medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh and other state funded subsidy revenues compared to million in the same period in in addition to certain of the factors discussed above  net patient revenues increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in primarily as a result of managed care pricing improvement and increased outpatient volumes

net inpatient revenue per patient day and per admission increased and  respectively  in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in this pricing increase reflects improved terms in our contracts with commercial managed care payers  as well as the increase in dsh and other state funded subsidy revenues described above  partially offset by an adverse shift in payer mix 
the increase in net outpatient revenue per visit was primarily due to the improved terms of our managed care contracts  partially offset by the provision of lower acuity services by outpatient centers we acquired in the past several years  as well as an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix 
three months ended december  provision for doubtful accounts increase decrease provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts collection rate on self pay accounts collection rate on commercial managed care accounts the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  self pay accounts receivable are comprised of both uninsured and balance after insurance receivables 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to the increase in uninsured patient volumes in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december   partially offset by the impact of a basis point improvement in our collection rate on self pay accounts 
our self pay collection rate  which is the blended collection rate for uninsured and balance after insurance accounts receivable  was approximately at december  and at december  three months ended december  selected operating expenses increase decrease hospital operations and other salaries  wages and benefits supplies other operating expenses total conifer salaries  wages and benefits other operating expenses total total salaries  wages and benefits supplies other operating expenses total rent lease expense hospital operations and other conifer total hospital operations and other salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day supplies per adjusted patient day other operating expenses per adjusted patient day total per adjusted patient day salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient admission supplies per adjusted patient admission other operating expenses per adjusted patient admission total per adjusted patient admission included in other operating expenses 
adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
total selected operating expenses  which is defined as salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses  increased by and on a per adjusted patient day and per adjusted patient admission basis  respectively  in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  the increase on a per adjusted patient admission basis was lower than the increase on a per adjusted patient day basis due in part to the impact of our focus on reducing average length of stay 
salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient admission increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of physicians we employ  annual merit and contractual wage increases for our employees  increased contract labor costs  increased annual incentive compensation expense  increased health benefits costs and increased employee related costs associated with our hit implementation program  partially offset by a decrease in overtime expense 
salaries  wages and benefits expense for our conifer segment increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  due to an increase in employee headcount as a result of the growth in conifer s business primarily attributable to the new chi partnership and conifer s two recent business acquisitions 

table of contents supplies expense per adjusted patient admission decreased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  supplies expense was favorably impacted by lower pharmaceutical costs and a decline in orthopedic costs due to renegotiated prices  partially offset by increased costs of implants and surgical supplies 
other operating expenses per adjusted patient admission increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in this change is primarily due to increased costs of contracted services  increased systems implementation costs primarily related to our hit implementation program  increased consulting and legal expenses  costs related to agreements to fund indigent care services by certain of our texas hospitals beginning in the three months ended december   and increased rent and lease expenses  partially offset by decreased malpractice expense and decreased physician relocation expenses 
in the period  we also recognized a million gain on the sale of land and buildings 
malpractice expense in the period includes a favorable adjustment of approximately million due to a basis point increase in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities compared to an unfavorable adjustment of approximately million as a result of an eight basis point decrease in the interest rate in the period 
other operating expenses for our conifer segment increased by in the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december  primarily due to additional operating expenses related to the new chi partnership and conifer s two recent business acquisitions

sources of revenue we receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources  primarily managed care payers and the federal medicare program  as well as state medicaid programs  indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients that is  patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement 
the table below shows the sources of net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts for our general hospitals  expressed as percentages of net patient revenues before provision for doubtful accounts from all sources years ended december  net patient revenues from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other our payer mix on an admissions basis for our general hospitals  expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources  is shown below years ended december  admissions from medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services of the us department of health and human services hhs 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poor and most vulnerable individuals 
the affordable care act was enacted to change how health care services in the united states are covered  delivered and reimbursed 
one key provision of the affordable care act is the individual mandate  which requires most americans to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage 
for individuals who are not exempt from the individual mandate  and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program  the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company 
beginning in  those who do not comply with the individual mandate must make a shared responsibility payment to the federal government in the form of a tax penalty 
another key provision of the affordable care act is the expansion of medicaid coverage 
the current medicaid program offers federal funding to states to assist pregnant women  children  needy families  the blind  the elderly and the disabled in obtaining medical care 
the affordable care act  as enacted  expanded the scope of the medicaid program  increased the number of individuals the states must cover and penalized states that refused to comply with medicaid expansion with the possibility of losing of their federal medicaid funding 
however  the us supreme court struck down the medicaid expansion provision in june following the appeal of a lawsuit first filed in federal district court by states  several individuals and the national federation 
table of contents of independent business challenging the constitutionality of various provisions of the affordable care act 
the expansion of the medicaid program in each state will require state legislative action and the approval by cms of a state medicaid plan amendment 
there is no deadline for a state to undertake expansion and qualify for the enhanced federal funding available under the affordable care act 
we cannot provide any assurances as to whether or when the states in which we operate might choose to expand their medicaid programs 
we anticipate that health care providers will benefit over time from provisions of the affordable care act that will extend insurance coverage through medicaid  state sponsored  federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid  and private insurance to a broader segment of the us population 
however  the affordable care act also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce medicare and medicaid program spending  including negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for medicare inpatient  outpatient  long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems  which began in  as well as additional productivity adjustments that began in  and reductions to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in federal fiscal year ffy as the number of uninsured individuals declines 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity  the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of uninsured patients who will obtain insurance coverage  uncertainty regarding future negotiations with payers  and gradual or potentially delayed implementation 
furthermore  we are unable to predict what action  if any  congress might take with respect to the affordable care act or the actions individual states might take with respect to expanding medicaid coverage as originally contemplated by the affordable care act 
in addition to the changes affected by the affordable care act  the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative and judicial rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited  or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage sometimes called part c or ma plans  includes health maintenance organizations hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos  private fee for service medicare special needs plans and medicare medical savings account plans 
the major components of our net patient revenues  including our general hospitals and other operations  for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan for the years ended december   and are set forth in the following table years ended december  revenue descriptions medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group operating medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group capital outliers outpatient disproportionate share direct graduate and indirect medical education other adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances total medicare net patient revenues includes indirect medical education revenue earned by our children s hospital under the children s hospitals graduate medical education payment program administered by the health resources and services administration of hhs 
the other revenue category includes inpatient psychiatric units  inpatient rehabilitation units  one long term acute care hospital  other revenue adjustments  and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances 
a general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan is provided below 
recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found below under regulatory and legislative changes 

table of contents acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system pps 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a system of medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups ms drgs  which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each ms drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular ms drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all ms drgs 
the base payment amount for the operating component of the ms drg payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs  respectively 
using diagnosis and procedure information submitted by the hospital  cms assigns to each discharge an ms drg  and the base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the ms drg assigned 
the ms drg operating and capital base rates  relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually  with consideration given to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  the relative costs associated with each ms drg  and changes in labor data by geographic area 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals on individual claims for treating medicare patients whose medical conditions are costlier to treat than those of the average patient in the same ms drg 
to qualify for a cost outlier payment  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the ms drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
a medicare administrative contractor mac calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospital s most recently filed cost report 
generally  if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the ms drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all pps hospitals to be not less than or more than of total ms drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of ms drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify for outlier payments 
medicare rural floor budget neutrality adjustment settlement in april  we entered into an industry wide settlement the medicare budget neutrality settlement with hhs  the secretary of hhs and cms that corrects medicare payments made to providers for inpatient hospital services for a number of prior periods 
the balanced budget act of created the rural floor  which is intended to ensure that the wage adjusted ipps rates for providers in urban areas in a state are not lower than the wage adjusted ipps rates for rural providers in the same state 
congress required that the rural floor adjustment  which would otherwise increase aggregate ipps payments  be administered in a budget neutral manner 
cms included a rural floor budget neutrality adjustment in annual ipps updates to the base payment rate  however  it did so in a manner that went beyond what was required to achieve budget neutrality 
our settlement with the government  which is included in adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances in the table above  resulted in a net favorable adjustment in the three months ended march  of approximately million  of which million related to continuing operations revenues of million less million of legal fees 
substantially all of the cash proceeds to which the company is entitled under the settlement were received during the three months ended june  disproportionate share hospital payments in addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries  medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients 
dsh payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by cms and are calculated as a percentage add on to the ms drg payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for dsh payments 
the primary method for a hospital to qualify for dsh payments is based on a complex statutory formula that results in a dsh percentage that is applied to payments based on ms drgs 
the hospital specific dsh percentage is equal to the sum of the percentage of medicare inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for both the traditional medicare plan part a and supplemental security income ssi percentage  and the percentage of total inpatient days attributable to patients eligible for medicaid but not medicare part a 
hospitals receive interim dsh payments that are reconciled in the annual cost report 
cms develops and distributes the hospital specific ssi percentages  typically one year after the close of the federal fiscal year  however  the release of the ssi percentages was delayed several years as cms examined and refined the underlying data  in 
table of contents particular the data supporting cms policy of including medicare advantage days in the calculation of the ssi ratio 
during this time  cms instructed the macs to suspend the settlement of cost reports pending the completion of its review of the ssi data 
the ffy ssi ratios previously issued by cms generally included the medicare advantage days for teaching hospitals only 
cms initiated a data collection effort intended to ensure that the ssi ratios include the medicare advantage days for non teaching hospitals as well 
since  we have estimated the impact of including the medicare advantage days of our non teaching hospitals using internal estimates of the ssi ratios 
we accrued approximately million in reserves for potential ssi adjustments in prior reporting periods  including million in during the three months ended march   cms released revised ssi ratios for ffys and  and ssi ratios for ffys and  which  according to cms  include the medicare advantage days  based on these ratios  we increased the aforementioned reserves by approximately million related to our hospitals in continuing operations and approximately million related to our hospitals in discontinued operations 
during the three months ended september   cms released the ssi ratios for ffy  which also include the medicare advantage days  and removed the aforementioned suspension on issuing cost report settlements 
based on these ratios  we increased the aforementioned reserves by approximately million related to our hospitals in continuing operations and decreased the reserves by approximately million related to our hospitals in discontinued operations 
during the three months ended december   we received cost report settlements previously held in abeyance due to the aforementioned moratorium  resulting in a cash outflow of approximately million  substantially all of which is related to the ssi percentages 
we expect to be required to pay the remainder of the estimated liability related to the ssi percentages during the medicare dsh statutes and regulations have been the subject of various administrative appeals and lawsuits  and our hospitals have been participating in these appeals  including challenges to the inclusion of medicare advantage days in the ssi ratios 
these types of appeals generally take several years to resolve  particularly for multi hospital organizations  because of cms administrative appeal rules 
during the three months ended december   the federal district court in the district of columbia ruled that the secretary of hhs failed to follow the administrative procedures act when promulgating the regulation requiring the inclusion of the medicare advantage days in the ssi ratios 
the court remanded the matter to the secretary and vacated the regulation it found to be improperly promulgated 
subsequently  the secretary appealed the district court s order to the court of appeals 
the company s dsh appeals are still pending  however  the outcome of the aforementioned case could influence the disposition of our appeals 
we cannot predict the timing or outcome of our dsh appeals  however  a favorable outcome of our appeals could have a material impact on our future revenues and cash flows 
we are also not able to predict what additional action the secretary might take with respect to the regulation vacated by the district court 
direct graduate and indirect medical education payments the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte limits  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education dgme and indirect medical education ime payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit teaching hospitals to enter into medicare graduate medical education affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our teaching hospitals have entered into such agreements 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps is based on prospectively determined per diem rates and includes an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 
inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 

table of contents payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups 
to be paid under the irf pps  each hospital or unit must demonstrate on an annual basis that at least of its total population had either a principal or secondary diagnosis that fell within one or more of the qualifying conditions designated in the medicare regulations governing irfs 
as of december   all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required threshold 
physician services payment system medicare pays for physician and other professional services based on a list of services and their payment rates  called the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs 
in determining payment rates for each service on the fee schedule  cms considers the amount of work required to provide a service  expenses related to maintaining a practice  and liability insurance costs 
the values given to these three types of resources are adjusted by variations in the input prices in different markets  and then a total is multiplied by a standard dollar amount  called the fee schedule s conversion factor  to arrive at the payment amount 
medicare s payment rates may be adjusted based on provider characteristics  additional geographic designations and other factors 
the conversion factor updates payments for physician services every year according to a formula called the sustainable growth rate sgr system 
this formula is intended to keep spending growth a function of service volume growth consistent with growth in the national economy 
however  in the last several years  congress has specified an update outside of the sgr formula 
because of budget neutrality requirements  these payment updates have largely been funded by payment reductions to other providers  including hospitals 
cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
for filed cost reports  we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
medicaid medicaid programs and the corresponding reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated revenues under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care medicaid programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also receive dsh payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenues attributable to dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
because most states must operate with balanced budgets  and the medicaid program is generally a significant portion of a state s budget  states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting future legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
the economic downturn has increased budget pressures on most states  and these budget pressures have resulted  and likely will continue to result  in decreased spending for medicaid programs in many states 
in addition  some states are implementing delays in issuing medicaid payments to providers 
increased medicaid enrollment due to the economic downturn  budget gaps and other factors could result in future reductions to medicaid payments  payment delays or additional taxes on hospitals 
as an alternative means of funding provider payments  several states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting broad based provider taxes to fund the non federal share of medicaid programs 
most states have introduced provider fee arrangements  which are intended to enhance funding or partially mitigate reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
in september  the governor of california signed legislation that created a hospital fee program to provide supplemental medi cal payments to hospitals retroactive to july  and expiring on december  the month 
table of contents program 
during the three months ended june   the governor of california signed the state s budget  which included a change to the fee program 
this legislative change and approval by cms of the fee for service supplemental payment and assessment portions of the month program in june enabled us to record million of net revenues related to the month program in  of which million had not been received as of december  we recorded million of net revenues from similar california hospital fee programs during the year ended december  we expect the managed care portion of the month program to be approved in based on the most recent california hospital association estimates  the month program could result in approximately million of net revenues for our california hospitals 
at such time as cms approves the managed care portion of the fee program  we expect to make a one time adjustment to record the retroactive impact of the additional revenues net of assessments  and record the remaining net revenues for the program years ratably over the remaining term of the program 
we cannot provide any assurances regarding the final approval of the managed care portion of the month program by cms or the timing or amount of the payments we may ultimately receive or be required to make 
the state of georgia adopted an amended budget for the state fiscal year ended june  that included additional funding for payments to private hospitals from the indigent care trust fund ictf  the state s disproportionate share program 
as a result  we recognized ictf revenues of approximately million in during  we recorded million of ictf revenues 
we cannot provide any assurances regarding the amount  if any  of ictf payments we might receive in during the three months ended june   we received notification of our net revenues under a north carolina hospital fee program retroactive to january  through september  as a result  we recognized million of net revenues from this program during this program has no sunset date 
based on an audit of missouri s medicaid plan years  we had recorded a liability of approximately million as of september  related to estimated medicaid dsh overpayments 
we formally challenged the recovery of the overpayment and  during the three months ended december   we settled the matter for million 
as a result  we recognized a favorable adjustment to net operating revenues of approximately million during the three months ended december  during the three months ended december   certain of our texas hospitals began to participate in the texas demonstration waiver approved by cms in december to replace the state s upper payment limit program 
the waiver term covers state fiscal years september  through august   is funded by intergovernmental transfer payments from local government entities  and includes two funding pools uncompensated care and delivery system reform payment 
we recognized million of revenues associated with this waiver program during the three months ended december   which we have not yet received 
separately  during the same period we incurred million of expenses related to funding indigent care services by certain of our texas hospitals 
the state is also negotiating with local government entities the amount of intergovernmental transfer funding that will be provided for the state s medicaid dsh program 
in  we recognized million in revenues from the texas waiver and dsh programs 
we cannot provide any assurances as to the ultimate amount of revenues that our hospitals may receive from these programs in because we cannot predict what actions the federal government or the states may take under existing legislation and future legislation to address budget gaps or deficits  we are unable to assess the effect that any such legislation might have on our business  but the impact on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be material

the updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year 
on august   cms issued the changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for acute care hospitals and fiscal year rates final rule 
the final rule includes the following payment and policy changes a market basket increase of for ms drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data would receive an increase of  cms is also making certain adjustments to the estimated market basket increase that result in a net market basket update of  including the following adjustments to the market basket index market basket index and productivity reductions required by the affordable care act of and  respectively  a reduction of to permanently remove the remaining portion of the estimated documentation and coding adjustment resulting from the conversion to ms drgs based on cms analysis of ffy and ffy claims data  and restoration of a reduction that was required to complete the recovery in ffy of the estimated ms drg documentation and coding overpayments for ffys and  a net increase in the capital federal ms drg rate  and a decrease in the cost outlier threshold from  to  cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the final rule will yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
using the impact percentages in the final rule as applied to our ipps payments for the months ended september   the estimated annual impact for all changes in the final rule on our hospitals is an increase in our medicare inpatient revenues of approximately million

according to cms estimates  the projected annual impact of the payment and policy changes in the final opps rule on our hospitals is an million increase in medicare outpatient revenues 
because of the uncertainty associated with factors that may influence our future opps payments by individual hospital  including patient volumes and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
changes to the medicare physician fee schedule on november   cms issued the cy medicare physician fee schedule final rule detailing medicare physician payment policies for the rule confirmed that  unless congress intervened  medicare s physician payments were scheduled to decrease in january by

medicare prepayment reviews the improper payments information act of  amended by the improper payments elimination and recovery act of  requires the heads of federal agencies  including hhs  to annually review programs it administers to identify programs that may be susceptible to significant improper payments  estimate the amount of improper payments in those programs  submit those estimates to congress  and describe the actions the agency is taking to reduce improper payments in those programs 
cms has identified the medicare fee for service ffs program as a program at risk for significant erroneous payments 
in  the medicare ffs paid claims error rate was estimated to be  or approximately billion in improper payments 
as a result  in addition to the recovery audit contractor rac program  which currently performs post payment claims reviews  cms has recently established initiatives to prevent improper payments before a claim is processed 
these initiatives include a significant increase in the number of prepayment claims reviews performed by macs  and a three year demonstration project that expands the scope of the rac program to include prepayment reviews in states  these reviews  which commenced in august  are initially focusing on inpatient claims  in particular short stays 
claims selected for prepayment review are not subject to the normal medicare ffs payment timeframe 
furthermore  prepayment claims denials are subject to administrative and judicial review 
the degree to which our medicare ffs claims are subjected to prepayment reviews  the extent to which payments are denied  and our success in overturning denials could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 
affordable care act the affordable care act was enacted to change how health care services in the united states are covered  delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals  reduced growth and other reductions in medicare program spending  and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration 
in addition  the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance  expands existing efforts to tie medicare and medicaid payments to performance and quality  and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the affordable care act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
on the other hand  the affordable care act provides for significant reductions in medicare market basket updates and reductions in medicare and medicaid dsh payments 
given that approximately of our net patient revenues in were from medicare and medicaid  reductions to these programs may significantly impact us and could offset any positive effects of the affordable care act 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the affordable care act on our future revenues and operations at this time due to the law s complexity  the limited amount of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  uncertainty regarding the ultimate number of uninsured patients who will obtain insurance coverage and uncertainty regarding future negotiations with payers 

table of contents furthermore  many of the provisions of the affordable care act that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until or later 
in addition  the affordable care act will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to participate in medicaid expansion and the grants and other incentive opportunities under the law 
at this time  we are unable to predict the timing and impact of changes resulting from actions individual states have taken or might take with respect to expanding medicaid coverage 
because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increases in volumes and revenues and decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  the reductions in medicare spending  the reductions in medicare and medicaid dsh funding  and numerous other provisions in the affordable care act legislation that may affect us 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra was enacted to stimulate the us economy 
one provision of arra provides financial incentives to hospitals and physicians to become meaningful users of electronic health records 
the medicare incentive payments to individual hospitals are made over a four year  front weighted transition period 
the medicaid incentive payments  which are administered by the states  are subject to more flexible payment and compliance standards than medicare incentive payments  hospitals that achieve compliance between and will receive reduced incentive payments during the transition period 
we will be required to make investments in hit through in excess of million million of which had already been invested as of december  compared to approximately million of medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments  some of which we were able to recognize in and  as described below 
in addition to the expenditures we incur to qualify for these incentive payments  our operating expenses have increased and we anticipate will increase in the future as a result of these information system investments 
much or all of these expenditures may have been made by us as a part of our clinical systems enhancements  but would not have been incurred in the timeline to comply with the incentive payment requirements of arra 
however  we anticipate there will be other operational benefits that we can realize as a result of these hit enhancements that are not included in the above amounts 
hospitals that fail to become meaningful users of ehrs or fail to submit quality data by will be subject to penalties in the form of a reduction to medicare payments 
this reduction  which will be based on the market basket update  will be phased in over three years and will continue until a hospital achieves compliance 
should all of our hospitals fail to become meaningful users of ehrs and fail to submit quality data  the penalties would result in reductions to our annual medicare traditional inpatient net revenues of approximately million  million and million in   and and subsequent years  respectively 
during the year ended december   of our hospitals and certain of our employed physicians attested to meaningful use of certified ehr technology 
as a result  we recognized approximately million of ehr incentives related to the medicare and medicaid ehr incentive programs 
these incentives partially offset approximately million of operating expenses we incurred in related to our overall hit implementation program 
the final medicare ehr incentive payments are determined when the cost report that begins in the federal fiscal year during which the hospital achieved meaningful use is settled 
medicare and medicaid incentive payment amounts to which a provider is entitled are subject to post payment audits 
the complexity of the changes required to our hospitals systems and the time required to complete the changes will likely result in some or all of our hospitals not being fully compliant in time to be eligible for the maximum hit funding permitted under arra 
because of the uncertainties regarding the implementation of hit  including cms future ehr implementation regulations  the ability of our hospitals to achieve compliance and the associated costs  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the aforementioned estimates 
the american taxpayer relief act of the american taxpayer relief act of  which was enacted on january   includes the following provisions affecting hospital and physician medicare payments an extension of two months until april  of the automatic reduction referred to as sequestration in medicare payments required by the budget control act of  
table of contents the so called doc fix  which continues medicare payments under the mpfs at cy levels through december   this measure averts a reduction of as finalized in the mpfs final rule and as required by the sgr formula  and a requirement that the secretary of hhs recover billion in overpayments to providers related to ipps documentation and coding improvements over no more than four years beginning in ffy it remains uncertain as to whether the aforementioned sequestration adjustment will be triggered  however  additional action by congress will be required to prevent it from occurring or to terminate it 
it is likely that if sequestration is avoided or terminated  other payment reductions affecting our hospitals and physicians could be enacted 
we cannot predict what other action congress might take to address federal spending or the impact those actions could have on our operations or cash flows  however  it is likely that additional reductions to medicare payments to hospitals and modifications to health care entitlement program eligibility will be among the items considered in spending reduction discussions 
also  we cannot predict the timing of or how cms will administer the aforementioned documentation and coding overpayment recovery 
we expect the details of the recovery to be included in the ffy ipps rulemaking 
medicare and medicaid recovery audit contractor initiatives section of the tax relief and health care act of authorized a permanent program involving the use of third party recovery audit contractors racs to identify medicare overpayments and underpayments made to providers 
racs are compensated based on the amount of both overpayments and underpayments they identify by reviewing claims submitted to medicare for correct coding and medical necessity 
cms must approve new issues prior to widespread review by the racs 
historically  racs have conducted claims reviews on a post payment basis 
in february  cms announced that it is moving forward with a rac prepayment demonstration in states 
we have been advised by cms that only our hospitals located in texas and pennsylvania will be included in the rac prepayment review demonstration project 
at commencement of the demonstration in august  prepayment review was limited to short stays in a single ms drg  and cms has stated that it will be reviewing only a small percentage of claims within that ms drg 
once fully implemented  the demonstration project will conduct prepayment review of eight ms drgs 
we have established protocols to respond to rac requests and payment denials 
payment recoveries resulting from rac reviews are appealable through administrative and judicial processes  and we intend to pursue the reversal of adverse determinations where appropriate 
in addition to overpayments that are not reversed on appeal  we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials 
we expect that the racs will continue to seek cms approval to review additional issues 
in addition to increasing funding for the cms medicaid integrity program  which employs medicaid integrity contractors to audit medicaid claims  the affordable care act expanded the rac program s scope to include medicare advantage plans and medicaid claims beginning in we cannot predict with certainty the impact of these program safeguard activities on our future results of operations or cash flows 
medpac report to congress on january   the medicare payment advisory commission medpac issued its annual report to congress 
the report included one recommendation affecting hospitals  which is that congress should increase payment rates for the inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems in by 
although briefly addressed in its recommendations  medpac did not recommend that payments for evaluation and management services provided in the outpatient setting be reduced to match payments for such evaluation and management services paid under the physician fee schedule 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various hmos and ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide reduced benefits or reimbursement or none at all to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments  co insurance or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans  including high deductible health care plans that may have limited benefits  but cost the employee less in premiums 

table of contents the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
at december  and approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
based on reserves as of december   a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by approximately million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms  as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had improved year over year managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in future years 
it is not clear what impact  if any  the increased obligations on managed care and other payers imposed by the affordable care act will have on our commercial managed care volumes and payment rates 
in the year ended december  our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  do not have some form of private insurance and  therefore  are responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant portion of our self pay patients is admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment that is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe that our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including increased unemployment rates  reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems 
at both december  and  approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with 
table of contents insurance 
we provide revenue cycle management services through our conifer subsidiary  which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we have been increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts  as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance  that we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact with uninsured patients compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to certain uninsured patients  which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
a significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts 
under the compact  the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance  which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded 
the uninsured patient accounts  net of contractual allowances recorded  are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process 
in july  the president signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act into law 
under the dodd frank act  a new consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was formed within the us federal reserve to promulgate regulations to promote transparency  simplicity  fairness  accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services  including debt collection services 
the legislation gives significant discretion to the cfpb in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent to which conifer s operations could be affected by these developments 
our estimated costs based on selected operating expenses  which include salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues 
most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospital s eligibility for medicaid dsh payments 
revenues attributable to dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these payments are intended to mitigate our cost of uncompensated care  as well as reduced medicaid funding levels 
our estimated costs based on the selected operating expenses described above of caring for charity care patients for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our method of measuring the estimated costs uses adjusted self pay charity patient days multiplied by selected operating expenses per adjusted patient day 
the adjusted self pay charity patient days represents actual self pay charity patient days adjusted to include self pay charity outpatient services by multiplying actual self pay charity patient days by the sum of gross self pay charity inpatient revenues and gross self pay charity outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross self pay charity inpatient revenues 
the expansion of health insurance coverage under the affordable care act may result in a material increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage 
however  because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict with certainty the net effect on us of the expected increase in revenues and expected decrease in bad debt expense from providing care to previously uninsured and underinsured individuals  and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us 
in addition  even after implementation of the affordable care act  we may continue to experience a high level of bad debt expense and have to provide uninsured discounts and charity care due to the failure of states to expand medicaid coverage as originally contemplated by the affordable care act and for undocumented aliens who will not be permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government health care program

revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased  which included a increase in net patient revenues  compared to the year ended december  increases in pricing were the largest contributing factors  resulting in a increase in net patient revenues  while increases in our overall volumes resulted in a increase in net patient revenues 

table of contents our net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december   several factors impacted our net inpatient revenues in the period compared to the period  including improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  medicaid dsh and other state funded subsidy revenues of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   favorable adjustments of approximately million in the year ended december  related to the aforementioned medicare budget neutrality settlement  and an unfavorable shift in our total payer mix 
patient days decreased by and total admissions decreased by during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we believe the following factors contributed to the changes in our inpatient volume levels the current weak economic conditions  which we believe have adversely impacted the level of elective procedures performed at our hospitals  loss of patients to competing health care providers  and industry trends reflecting the shift of certain clinical procedures being performed in an outpatient setting rather than in an inpatient setting 
net outpatient revenues and total outpatient visits increased and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the growth in our outpatient revenues and volumes was related to both organic growth and growth from acquisitions 
net outpatient revenue per visit increased primarily due to the improved terms of our managed care contracts  partially offset by the provision of lower acuity services by outpatient centers we acquired in the past several years  as well as an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix 
our conifer subsidiary generated net operating revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a portion of which was eliminated in consolidation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the portion that was not eliminated in consolidation is primarily due to new clients  expanded service offerings and acquisitions 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in provision for doubtful accounts primarily related to increased uninsured patient volumes  partially offset by the impact of a basis point improvement in our collection rate on self pay accounts 

table of contents the table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at december  and december  december  accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net medicare medicaid net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances managed care self pay uninsured self pay balance after insurance estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to our conifer subsidiary other payers total continuing operations total discontinued operations we provide revenue cycle management and patient communications services  among others  through our conifer subsidiary  which has performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on the drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we have increased our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients as well 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts  as well as co payment and deductible amounts owed to us by patients with insurance  that we deem highly collectible 
we are dedicated to modifying and refining our processes as needed  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients  as well as co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past several years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
at december   our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately 
we experienced a relatively stable self pay collection rate during and as follows at march   at june   at both september  and december   at march   at june   and at september  these self pay collection rates include payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at december   a decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  which we believe could be a reasonably likely change  would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts 
we typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately at december  and at december  conifer continues to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve our cash flow 
these initiatives are focused on standardizing and improving patient access processes  including pre registration  registration  verification of eligibility and benefits  liability identification and collection at point of service  and financial counseling 
the goals of the effort are focused on reducing denials  improving service levels to patients and increasing the quality of accounts that end up in accounts receivable 
although we continue to focus on improving our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days  and accounts receivable by aging category 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our net accounts receivable from 
table of contents continuing operations of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations were days at both december  and  within our target of less than days 
ar days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our net operating revenues from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments to our conifer subsidiary dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts assigned to our conifer subsidiary is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from conifer s medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under the mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in the mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program  such as medicaid 
the following table shows the approximate amount of accounts receivable in the mep still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and by aging category december  days days days over days total salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient admission increased in the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of physicians we employ  annual merit and contractual wage increases for our employees  increased contract labor costs  increased annual incentive compensation expense  increased workers compensation expense  increased health benefits costs and increased employee related costs associated with our hit implementation program  partially offset by decreased overtime expense 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in is million of expense due to a basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future workers 
table of contents compensation liabilities  compared to a million unfavorable adjustment as a result of a basis point decrease in the interest rate in the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits expense for the years ended december  and also included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
salaries  wages and benefits expense for our conifer segment increased by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in employee headcount as a result of the growth in conifer s business primarily attributable to the new chi partnership and conifer s two recent business acquisitions 
as of december   approximately of our employees were represented by various labor unions 
these employees primarily registered nurses and service and maintenance workers were located at of our hospitals  the majority of which are in california and florida 
we have no expired contracts at this time  however  we are in the process of negotiating new contracts where employees have recently chosen union representation 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of the negotiations  but increases in salaries  wages and benefits could result from these agreements 
furthermore  there is a possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process  which could increase our labor costs and have an adverse effect on our patient admissions and net operating revenues 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  supplies expense per adjusted patient admission decreased in the year ended december  compared to the same period in supplies expense was favorably impacted by lower pharmaceutical costs and a decline in orthopedic and cardiology related costs due to renegotiated prices  partially offset by increased costs of implants and surgical supplies 
in general  supplies expense changes are primarily attributable to changes in our patient volume levels and the mix of procedures performed 
we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  contract compliance  improved utilization  bulk purchases and operational improvements 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedics and implants  and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of medassets  inc  a company that offers group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 
other operating expenses  net other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient admission increased by in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in other operating expenses for our hospital operations and other segment is primarily due to increased costs of contracted services million  primarily due to additional physician practices we acquired  higher consulting and legal costs of million  which includes costs related to the aforementioned medicare budget neutrality settlement and various managed care payer settlements  increased systems implementation costs million primarily related to our hit implementation program  increased rent and lease expenses million  million of costs associated with funding indigent care services by certain of our texas hospitals beginning in the three months ended december   and gains totaling million from the sale of land and buildings in the period compared to gains of million from the sale of a building at the former campus of one of our hospitals and a medical office building in the period 
these increases were partially offset by decreased physician relocation expenses million 
malpractice expense was million in the year ended december   which included an unfavorable adjustment of approximately million due to a basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities  compared to malpractice expense of million in the year ended december   which included an unfavorable adjustment of approximately million due to a basis point decrease in the interest rate 
the amount of malpractice expense in the year ended december  may not necessarily be indicative of malpractice expense amounts in future years due to changes in loss experience and interest rates used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities 
other operating expenses for our conifer segment increased by in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to additional operating expenses related to the new chi partnership and conifer s two recent business acquisitions 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million  consisting of million relating to the impairment of obsolete assets  million relating to other impairment charges  million of employee severance costs and million of other related costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
this amount included a million impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment 
material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time  consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believed the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
the aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was million as of december  after recording the impairment charge 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of million in connection with the sale of seven medical office buildings in texas  million related to a cost basis investment  million in employee severance costs  million in lease termination costs  million of acceleration of stock based compensation costs and million of other related costs 
our impairment tests presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining operating results in our hospitals  which are based on programs and initiatives being implemented that are designed to achieve the hospital s most recent projections 
if these projections are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  future impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we may incur additional restructuring charges 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the amount primarily related to costs associated with various legal proceedings and governmental reviews 
the amount primarily related to costs associated with our evaluation of an unsolicited acquisition proposal received in november which was subsequently withdrawn  changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  accruals for a physician privileges case and certain hospital related tort claims  the settlement of a union arbitration claim and costs to defend the company in various matters 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily related to a million favorable impact from an interest rate swap agreement we terminated in august during the year ended december   the interest rate swap agreement generated approximately million of cash interest savings and a million gain on the settlement of the agreement 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about this agreement 
loss from early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due that we purchased during the period 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due that we purchased during the period  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs 

table of contents income tax expense during the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million compared to million during the year ended december  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
discontinued operations impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge in discontinued operations of million related to the sale of creighton university medical center  consisting of million for the write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair values and a million charge for the write down of goodwill 
additional supplemental non gaap disclosures the financial information provided throughout this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  we use certain non gaap financial measures defined below in communications with investors  analysts  rating agencies  banks and others to assist such parties in understanding the impact of various items on our financial statements  some of which are recurring or involve cash payments 
in addition  from time to time we use these measures to define certain performance targets under our compensation programs

as is the case with all non gaap measures  investors should consider the limitations associated with this metric  including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another  and should recognize that adjusted ebitda does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance because it excludes many items that are included in our financial statements 
accordingly  investors are encouraged to use gaap measures when evaluating our financial performance

net outpatient revenues and total outpatient visits increased and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the growth in our outpatient revenues and volumes was substantially related to the acquisition of various outpatient centers during and outpatient revenue per visit declined primarily due to the provision of lower acuity services by outpatient centers we acquired in and  as well as an unfavorable shift in our total outpatient payer mix  including a decline in managed care outpatient visits as a percentage of total outpatient visits in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in our conifer subsidiary generated net operating revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a portion of which was eliminated in consolidation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  key factors contributing to the change in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december  compared to the same period in include i a million decrease in revenues from the uninsured in the period compared to the same period in  ii a million favorable adjustment in the period for medicare bad debts to be claimed on our cost reports compared to million in the period  and iii a lower collection rate on self pay accounts in the period compared to the period

based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance at december   a decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  which we believe could be a reasonable likely change  would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
our estimated collection rate from managed care payers was approximately and at december  and  respectively 
we experienced a temporary slowdown in collections related to commercial and governmental managed care accounts receivable in the year ended december  as a result of a revenue cycle operational realignment we initiated that resulted in the closure of two of our service centers

the following table shows the approximate amount of accounts receivable in conifer s medical eligibility program  still awaiting determination of eligibility under a government program at december  and by aging category december  days days days over days total salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient admission increased in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to annual merit increases for our employees  as well as an increase in the number of physicians we employ  increased overtime costs  increased health benefits costs  increased k plan expense and increased employee related costs associated with our hit implementation program  partially offset by reductions in workers compensation expense and annual incentive compensation expense  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in is million of expense due to a basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future workers compensation liabilities 
salaries  wages and benefits expense for the years ended december  and also included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  supplies expense per adjusted patient admission decreased by in the year ended december  compared to the same period in supplies expense was unfavorably impacted by the higher cost of pharmaceuticals and increased costs of surgical supplies  partially offset by decreases in cardiology related costs due to renegotiated prices and lower volume levels 
in general  supplies expense changes are primarily attributable to changes in our patient volume levels and the mix of procedures performed 
other operating expenses  net other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient admission increased by 
table of contents in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this change is due in part to a million increase in malpractice expense in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in malpractice expense is primarily attributable to several large unfavorable case reserve adjustments in the period as compared to the prior year period  as well as a million unfavorable adjustment due to a basis point decrease in the interest rate used to estimate the discounted present value of projected future malpractice liabilities in the year ended december  there were also increases in other operating expenses due to increased physician and medical fees million  increased costs of contracted services million  increased systems implementation costs and information technology service contract expenses primarily related to our hit implementation program million  increased rent and lease expense million  increased physician relocation and income guarantee costs million  a favorable adjustment of million in the period related to the estimated recovery of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes paid prior to april on behalf of medical residents  increased hospital provider fees assessed by certain states in which we operate million  which were substantially offset by additional dsh payments recognized in net patient revenues  increased repairs and maintenance expense million  and a reduction in information systems and business office costs allocable to discontinued operations million 
these increases were partially offset by million of lower consulting costs and gains of million from the sale of a building at the former campus of one of our hospitals and a medical office building 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and restructuring charges  net during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
this amount included a million impairment charge for the write down of buildings and equipment of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment 
material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time  consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believed the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
the aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was recorded was million as of december  after recording the impairment charge 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges of million in connection with the sale of seven medical office buildings in texas  million related to a cost basis investment  million in employee severance costs  million in lease termination costs  million of acceleration of stock based compensation costs and million of other related costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million 
this amount included a million net impairment charge for the write down of buildings  equipment and other long lived assets  primarily capitalized software costs classified in other intangible assets  of one of our previously impaired hospitals to their estimated fair values  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of real estate in the market in which the hospital operates and a decline in the estimated fair value of equipment 
material adverse trends in our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the hospital at that time  consistent with our previous estimates in prior years when impairment charges were recorded at this hospital  indicated the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets was not recoverable from the estimated future cash flows 
we believed the most significant factors contributing to the adverse financial trends at that time included reductions in volumes of insured patients  shifts in payer mix from commercial to governmental payers combined with reductions in reimbursement rates from governmental payers  and high levels of uninsured patients 
as a result  we updated the estimate of the fair value of the hospital s long lived assets and compared the fair value estimate to the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets 
because the fair value estimate was lower than the carrying value of the hospital s long lived assets  an impairment charge was recorded for the difference in the amounts 
we disclosed in our form k for the year ended december  that  unless the anticipated future financial trends of this hospital improved to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long lived assets  this hospital was at risk of future impairments  which impairments occurred in as described above  particularly if we spent significant amounts of capital at the hospital without generating a corresponding increase in the hospital s fair value or if the fair value of the hospital s real estate or equipment continued to decline 
the aggregate carrying value of assets held and used of the hospital for which an impairment charge was 
table of contents recorded was million as of december  after recording the impairment charge 
in addition  we recorded a million net impairment charge in connection with the sale of nine medical office buildings in florida and million in employee severance and other related costs 
these charges were partially offset by a million credit related to the collection of a note receivable due from a buyer of one of our previously divested hospitals  which had been fully reserved in a prior year 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the amount is comprised of costs associated with our evaluation of an unsolicited acquisition proposal received in november which was subsequently withdrawn  changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews described in note to the consolidated financial statements  accruals for a physician privileges case and certain hospital related tort claims  the settlement of a union arbitration claim  and costs to defend the company in various matters 
the costs primarily related to costs to defend the company in various matters and changes in reserve estimates established in connection with certain governmental reviews  as well as costs associated with our evaluation of the unsolicited acquisition proposal received in november interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense primarily relates to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during and the million favorable impact from an interest rate swap agreement we terminated in august during the year ended december   the interest rate swap agreement generated approximately million of cash interest savings and a million gain on the settlement of the agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this agreement 
loss from early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due that we purchased during the period  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due that we purchased during the period  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts  issuance costs and unrecognized interest rate hedge settlements associated with the notes 
in addition  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for total cash of million 
income tax expense benefit during the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of million compared to a million benefit during the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense in the period is primarily due to the elimination of substantially all of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the three months ended september  we now recognize income tax expense that includes little or no change in the deferred tax valuation allowance  whereas in the period the tax impact associated with our earnings was substantially offset by the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail about these amounts 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our obligations to make future cash payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as standby letters of credit and minimum revenue guarantees  are summarized in the table below  all as of december  years ending december  later total years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations long term non cancelable operating leases standby letters of credit guarantees asset retirement obligations academic affiliation agreements tax liabilities supplemental executive retirement plan obligations information technology contract services purchase orders total includes interest through maturity date lease termination 
includes minimum revenue guarantees  primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals  and operating lease guarantees 
these agreements contain various rights and termination provisions 
professional liability and workers compensation reserves have been excluded from the table 
at december   the current and long term professional and general liability reserves included in our consolidated balance sheet were approximately million and million  respectively  and the current and long term workers compensation reserves included in our consolidated balance sheet were approximately million and million  respectively 
standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is primarily dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers 
the standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility  as amended november  we consummated the following transactions affecting our long term commitments in the year ended december  we entered into a million commitment during the three months ended march  for future professional services to be provided to us and licensed software fees related to our initiative to achieve full compliance with the arra hit requirements 
we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in october the senior secured notes will mature on june   and the senior notes will mature on february  we will pay interest on the senior secured notes semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing on june  we will pay interest on the senior notes semi annually in arrears on february and august of each year  payments commenced on february  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due in a tender offer 
the remaining net proceeds were used for purchases of our other outstanding senior notes through public or privately negotiated transactions and for general corporate purposes  including strategic acquisitions and the repayment of indebtedness and drawings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we entered into non cancellable capital leases of approximately million  primarily for equipment 
as part of our long term objective to manage our capital structure  we may from time to time seek to retire  purchase  redeem or refinance some of our outstanding debt or equity securities subject to prevailing market conditions  our liquidity 
table of contents requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
these actions are part of our strategy to manage our leverage and capital structure over time  which is dependent on our total amount of debt  our cash and our operating results 
at december   using the last months of adjusted ebitda  our ratio of total long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalent balances  to adjusted ebitda was x 
we anticipate this ratio will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on earnings performance and other factors 
we intend to manage this ratio by following our business plan  managing our cost structure and through other changes in our capital structure  including  if appropriate  the issuance of equity or convertible securities 
our ability to achieve our leverage and capital structure objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  many of which are described in the forward looking statements and risk factors sections in part i of this report 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements including those required to achieve compliance with the hit requirements under arra  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new buildings  and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  which included million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for continuing operations for the year ending december  will total approximately million to million  including million that was accrued as a liability at december  our budgeted capital expenditures include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities pursuant to the terms of a negotiated consent decree 
we expect to spend approximately million more on such improvements over the next three years 
during the year ended december   we acquired as part of our hospital operations and other segment a diagnostic imaging center  an oncology center  an urgent care center  a health plan  a cyberknife center in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest  a majority interest in nine ambulatory surgery centers in one of which we had previously held a noncontrolling interest  as well as physician practice entities and a physician practice management company in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest 
also during the year ended december   our conifer segment acquired an information management and services company and a hospital revenue cycle management business 
the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisitions was million 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest payments were lower in the period due to our repurchases of outstanding senior notes during and the favorable impact from an interest rate swap agreement we terminated in august from time to time  we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates 
we were party to an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of million from february  through august  the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge 
it had the effect of converting our senior secured notes due from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid semi annually based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a floating rate spread of 
during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the senior secured notes were recorded in interest expense 
during the year ended december   our interest rate swap agreement generated million of cash interest savings and a million gain on the settlement of the agreement 
income tax payments  net of tax refunds  were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the year ended december  at december   our carryforwards available to offset future taxable income consisted of federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion pretax expiring in to  approximately million in alternative minimum tax credits with no expiration  general business credit carryforwards of approximately million expiring in to  and state nol carryforwards of billion expiring in to for which the associated deferred tax benefit  net of valuation allowance and federal tax impact  is million 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards to reduce future taxable income may be limited under section of the internal revenue code if certain ownership changes in our company occur during a rolling three year period 
these ownership changes include the offering of stock by us  the purchase or sale of our stock by shareholders  as defined in the treasury regulations  or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire our stock 
if such ownership changes by shareholders result in aggregate increases that exceed percentage points during the three year period  then section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our taxable income that may be offset by the nol carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change 
periodic examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authorities could result in the payment of additional taxes 
the irs has completed audits of our tax returns for all tax years ended on or before december  all disputed issues with respect to these audits have been resolved  and all related tax assessments 
table of contents including interest have been paid 
tax returns for years ended after december  are not currently under examination by the irs 
sources and uses of cash our liquidity for the year ended december  was primarily derived from net cash provided by operating activities  cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures  and our borrowing availability under our credit facility was million based on our borrowing base calculation as of december  our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted by lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt due to unfavorable shifts in payer mix  growth in admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients  and other factors 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the and periods include the following million of proceeds in the period related to our continuing operations from the aforementioned medicare budget neutrality settlement  income tax payments of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   higher payments on reserves for restructuring charges and litigation costs of million  and million less cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations 
we continue to seek further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet by generating incremental cash 
these initiatives may include the sale of excess land  buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets 
capital expenditures were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a share repurchase program expiring in december our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a separate share repurchase program in may under the program  as was the case with the program  shares may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in a manner consistent with applicable securities laws and regulations  including pursuant to a rule b plan maintained by the company  at times and in amounts based on market conditions and other factors 
pursuant to the share repurchase program  we paid approximately million to repurchase a total of  shares during the period from the commencement of the program through december   or an average of per share 
the share repurchase program  which was scheduled to expire on may   was completed in january pursuant to that share repurchase program  we paid approximately million to repurchase a total of  shares as adjusted to reflect a one for four reverse stock split in october  or an average of per share 
we record our investments that are available for sale at fair market value 
as shown in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
we have no investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the recent economic downturn that will materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants we have a senior secured revolving credit facility  as amended november  the credit agreement  that provides  subject to borrowing availability  for revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  with a million subfacility for standby letters of credit 
the credit agreement has a scheduled maturity date of november   subject to our repayment or refinancing on or before december  of approximately million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due approximately million of which was outstanding at december  
if such repayment or refinancing does not occur  borrowings under the credit agreement will be due december  we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our credit agreement 
there were no 
table of contents of cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   and we had approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding 
our borrowing availability under the credit agreement was million based on our borrowing base calculation as of december  in february  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes  which will mature on april  we will pay interest on the senior secured notes semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing on october  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior secured notes due in a tender offer and to call approximately million of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding of those notes 
in connection with the purchase  we expect to record a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately million primarily related to the difference between the purchase prices and the par values of the purchased notes  as well as the write off of unamortized note discounts and issuance costs 
in october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due in a tender offer 
in april  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due at a premium for million of cash proceeds and an additional million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a private financing related to our repurchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
we were party to an interest rate swap agreement for an aggregate notional amount of million from february  through august  the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge and was being used to manage our exposure to future changes in interest rates 
it had the effect of converting our senior secured notes due from a fixed interest rate paid semi annually to a variable interest rate paid semi annually based on the six month libor plus a floating rate spread of 
during the term of the interest rate swap agreement  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the senior secured notes were recorded in interest expense 
during the year ended december   our interest rate swap agreement generated million of cash interest savings and a million gain on the settlement of the agreement 
for additional information regarding our long term debt  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
we believe our existing debt agreements provide significant flexibility for future secured or unsecured borrowings 
in october  we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due in a tender offer 
the remaining net proceeds were used for purchases of our other outstanding senior notes through public or privately negotiated transactions and for general corporate purposes  including strategic acquisitions and the repayment of indebtedness and drawings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we continue to focus on opportunities to enhance the company s primary business lines and plan to expend approximately million in the near term to acquire acute care hospitals  outpatient facilities and business process services companies 
during the three months ended december   we spent approximately million on acquisitions 
our cash on hand fluctuates day to day throughout the year based on the timing and levels of routine cash receipts and disbursements  including our book overdrafts  and required cash disbursements  such as interest and income tax payments 
these fluctuations result in material intra quarter net operating and investing uses of cash that has caused  and in the future could cause  us to use our senior secured revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity 
we expect to be required to pay approximately million as a result of the ssi matter described under disproportionate share hospital payments under the caption sources of revenue during we will be required to make the payments at the time of the cost report settlements pending the final outcome of our appeals related to this matter  the macs commenced issuing the relevant cost report settlements during the three months ended september  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  availability under our revolving credit facility  anticipated future cash provided by operating activities  and our investments in marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet should be 
table of contents adequate to meet our current cash needs 
these sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash requirements could be materially affected by the use of cash in acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of securities  and also by a deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections of this report  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancings  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured 
we do not rely on commercial paper or other short term financing arrangements nor do we enter into repurchase agreements or other short term financing arrangements not otherwise reported in our period end balance sheets 
we do not have any significant european sovereign debt exposure 
we continue to aggressively identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  including the acquisition of outpatient businesses  physician recruitment and alignment strategies  expansion of our management services business within conifer  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals  and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  our performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements our consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and include million  million and million  respectively  of net operating revenues and million  million and million  respectively  of operating income generated from four general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements 
in accordance with gaap  the applicable buildings and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases 
the current terms of these leases expire between and  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
in february  we exercised our options under the leases to purchase three of the hospitals 
if these leases expire  and we do not purchase the hospitals  we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from such hospitals 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of december  recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts  including contractual allowances  provisions for doubtful accounts  electronic health record incentives  accruals for general and professional liability risks  accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans  
table of contents accruals for litigation losses  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts in the period in which our services are performed 
net operating revenues before provision for doubtful accounts primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans  as well as certain uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
retrospectively determined cost based revenues under these programs  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as dsh  dgme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
we have a system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be an approximately increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowances related to managed care plans 
based on reserves as of december   a increase or decrease in the estimated contractual allowance would impact the estimated reserves by approximately million 
some of the factors that can contribute to changes in the contractual allowance estimates include changes in reimbursement levels for procedures  supplies and drugs when threshold levels are triggered  changes in reimbursement levels when stop loss or outlier limits are reached  changes in the admission status of a patient due to physician orders subsequent to initial diagnosis or testing  final coding of in house and discharged not final billed patients that change reimbursement levels  secondary benefits determined after primary insurance payments  and reclassification of patients among insurance plans with different coverage levels 
contractual allowance estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms  as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated  however  there are various exceptions that can occur 
such exceptions can include  for example  instances where we are unable to obtain verification because the patient s insurance company was unable to be reached or contacted  a determination is made that a patient may be eligible for benefits under various government programs  such as medicaid or victims of crime  and it takes several days or weeks before qualification for such benefits is confirmed or denied  and under physician orders we provide services to patients that require immediate treatment 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an month look back period  and other relevant factors 
based on our accounts receivable from self pay patients and co payments and deductibles owed to us by patients with insurance as of december   a decrease or increase in our self pay collection rate  or approximately  which we believe could be a reasonable likely change  would result in an unfavorable or favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
there are various factors that can impact collection trends  such as changes in the economy  which in turn have an impact on unemployment rates and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients  the volume of patients through our emergency departments  the increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients with insurance  and business practices related to collection efforts 
these factors continuously change and can have an impact on collection trends and our estimation process 
our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to conifer between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned to conifer by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to conifer 
managed care accounts are collected through the regional business offices of conifer  whereby the account balances remain in the related hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years 
changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
electronic health record incentives under certain provisions of arra  federal incentive payments are available to hospitals  physicians and certain other professionals when they adopt  implement or upgrade aiu certified ehr technology or become meaningful users  as defined under arra  of ehr technology in ways that demonstrate improved quality  safety and effectiveness of care 
providers can become eligible for annual medicare incentive payments by demonstrating meaningful use of ehr technology in each period over four periods 
medicaid providers can receive their initial incentive payment by satisfying aiu criteria  but must demonstrate meaningful use of ehr technology in subsequent years in order to qualify for additional payments 
hospitals may be eligible for both medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments  however  physicians and other professionals may be eligible for either medicare or medicaid incentive payments  but not both 
hospitals that are meaningful users under the medicare ehr incentive payment program are deemed meaningful users under the medicaid ehr incentive payment program and do not need to meet additional criteria imposed by a state 
medicaid ehr incentive payments to providers are federally funded and administered by the states 
cms established calendar year as the first year states could offer ehr incentive payments 
before a state may offer ehr incentive payments  the state must submit and cms must approve the state s incentive plan 

table of contents we recognize medicaid ehr incentive payments in our consolidated statements of operations for the first payment year when cms approves a state s ehr incentive plan  and our hospital or employed physician acquires certified ehr technology ie  when aiu criteria are met 
medicaid ehr incentive payments for subsequent payment years are recognized in the period during which the specified meaningful use criteria are met 
we recognize medicare ehr incentive payments when the specified meaningful use criteria are met  and contingencies in estimating the amount of the incentive payments to be received are resolved 
the meaningful use information submitted to cms is subject to review  verification and audit 
additionally  the final medicare and medicaid ehr incentive payments under arra are based on financial and statistical data  which may be estimated using historical trends and current factors  in the settled medicare cost report for the cost reporting period that begins in the federal fiscal year in which the criteria are met 
we have acquired  developed and implemented systems to accumulate the information necessary to demonstrate meaningful use of ehr technology 
we also have a system and estimation process for recording the financial and statistical data utilized as part of the cost reporting process 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
cost report settlements are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
final settlement of cost reports  which could impact the financial and statistical data on which ehr incentives are based  or a determination that meaningful use was not attained could result in adjustment to previously recognized ehr incentive payments or retrospective recoupment of incentive payments 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims  to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors  including the number of expected claims  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments  and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments 
we consider the number of expected claims  average cost per claim and discount rate to be the most significant assumptions in estimating accruals for general and professional liabilities 
our liabilities are adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known 
malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our estimated reserves for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends 
we believe it is reasonably likely for there to be a increase or decrease in the number of expected claims or average cost per claim 
based on our reserves and other information as of december   a increase in the number of expected claims would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the number of expected claims would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
a increase in the average cost per claim would increase the estimated reserves by million  and a decrease in the average cost per claim would decrease the estimated reserves by million 
because our estimated reserves for future claim payments are discounted to present value  a change in our discount rate assumption could also have a significant impact on our estimated reserves 
our discount rate was  and at december   and  respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the estimated reserves by million 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
the table below shows the case reserves and incurred but not reported and loss development reserves as of december   and december  case reserves incurred but not reported and loss development reserves total undiscounted reserves several actuarial methods  including the incurred  paid loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods  are applied to our historical loss data to produce estimates of ultimate expected losses and the resulting incurred but not reported and loss development reserves 
these methods use our specific historical claims data related to paid losses and loss adjustment 
table of contents expenses  historical and current case reserves  reported and closed claim counts  and a variety of hospital census information 
based on these analyses  we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims  including the incurred but not reported and loss development reserve estimates 
the determination of our estimates involves subjective judgment and could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods if our actual experience is materially different than our assumptions 
malpractice claims generally take to years to settle from the time of the initial reporting of the occurrence to the settlement payment 
accordingly  the percentage of undiscounted reserves as of december  and representing unsettled claims is approximately and  respectively 
the following table  which includes both our continuing and discontinued operations  presents the amount of our accruals for professional and general liability claims and the corresponding activity therein years ended december  accrual for professional and general liability claims  beginning of the year expense income related to current year prior years expense from discounting total incurred loss and loss expense paid claims and expenses related to current year prior years total paid claims and expenses accrual for professional and general liability claims  end of year total malpractice expense for continuing operations  including premiums for insured coverage  was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
our discount rate for was and for was 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for by approximately million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease net periodic pension expense for by approximately million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  we calculate the amount of an impairment charge if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates 
table of contents of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the following risks future financial results of our hospitals  which can be impacted by volumes of insured patients and declines in commercial managed care patients  terms of managed care payer arrangements  our ability to collect accounts due from uninsured and managed care payers  loss of volumes as a result of competition  and our ability to manage costs such as labor costs  which can be adversely impacted by union activity and the shortage of experienced nurses  changes in payments from governmental health care programs and in government regulations such as reductions to medicare and medicaid payment rates resulting from government legislation or rule making or from budgetary challenges of states in which we operate  how the hospitals are operated in the future  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million  consisting of million relating to the impairment of obsolete assets  million relating to other impairment charges  million of employee severance costs and million of other related costs 
additionally  in our most recent impairment analysis as of december   we had two hospitals with an aggregate carrying value of long lived assets of approximately million whose estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets by an aggregate amount of approximately million 
these two hospitals had the smallest excess of future undiscounted cash flows on an annual basis necessary to recover the carrying value of their assets 
future adverse trends that result in necessary changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates of future undiscounted cash flows could result in the hospitals estimated cash flows being less than the carrying value of the assets  which would require a fair value assessment of the long lived assets and  if the fair value amount is less than the carrying value of the assets  impairment charges would occur and could be material 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by applicable accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable  improving or  in some cases  declining results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 

table of contents our continuing operations consist of two operating segments  our conifer subsidiary and our hospital and other operations 
our hospital and other operations are structured as follows our california region includes all of our hospitals in california  our central region includes all of our hospitals in missouri  tennessee and texas  our florida region includes all of our hospitals in florida  and our southern states region includes all of our hospitals in alabama  georgia  north carolina  pennsylvania and south carolina 
in addition to our conifer subsidiary  these regions are reporting units used to perform our goodwill impairment analysis and are one level below our operating segment level 
our hospitals in pennsylvania  which were previously part of a separate market  became part of our southern states region effective may  this change did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
future restructuring that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in future impairments of our goodwill 
our goodwill balance is primarily related to our southern states region  which totals approximately million  and our central region  which totals approximately million 
in our latest impairment analysis as of december   the estimated fair value of these regions exceeded the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill  by approximately and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative profits losses in recent years  adjusted for certain nonrecurring items  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  and the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
prior to the year ended december   we had not included projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance primarily as a result of negative evidence represented by our cumulative losses in recent years 
however  during the year ended december   our judgment about the need for a valuation allowance changed  and we concluded that the valuation allowance could be reduced to million 
as a result  the reduction in the valuation allowance of approximately billion was recorded as a benefit in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations 
our change in judgment resulted from our assessment that positive evidence outweighed negative evidence during thereby resulting in the inclusion of projections of future taxable income in the determination of the amount of the required valuation allowance 
the following factors were taken into account in our assessment 
table of contents cumulative profits for the three years ended december   projected profits for based on then current business plans  carryforward periods for utilization of federal net operating loss carryovers  significant improvement in operating performance in and as evidenced by improved cost controls  successful renegotiation of managed care contracts on favorable terms  successful quality control initiatives as reflected by improved clinical outcomes  successful execution of physician alignment strategies  and expansion of our outpatient business  and formulation of strategic initiatives to address uncertainties presented by the affordable care act and health information technology requirements under arra 
during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million based on profits and projected profits for during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million based on profits and projected profits for the remaining million balance in the valuation allowance as of december  is primarily attributable to certain state net operating loss carryovers that  more likely than not  will expire unutilized 
we consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions  and such judgments are subject to periodic review 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant dates and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected life  expected forfeiture rate  risk free interest rate range  early exercise threshold  and early exercise rate 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to unique events occurring during that time  which caused extreme volatility in our stock price  and two dates one in and one in with unusual volatility due to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon us treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 

table of contents the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of december  the fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments 
the average effective interest rates presented are based on the rate in effect at the reporting date 
the effects of unamortized premiums and discounts are excluded from the table 
maturity date  years ending december  thereafter total fair value dollars in millions fixed rate long term debt average effective interest rates at december   we had long term  market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries 
our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio 
at december   the net accumulated unrealized gains related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were less than million 
we have no affiliation with partnerships  trusts or other entities sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us 
thus  we have no exposure to the financing  liquidity  market or credit risks associated with such entities 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features
