item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a holding company which conducts operations through our wholly owned china subsidiaries 
our business is conducted and reported in three segments  namely  bromine  crude salt and chemical products 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  schc  we produce and trade bromine and crude salt 
we are one of the largest producers of bromine in china  as measured by production output 
elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture 
bromine also is used to form intermediary chemical compounds such as tmb bromine is commonly used in brominated flame retardants  fumigants  water purification compounds  dyes  medicines and disinfectants 
crude salt is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical  food beverage  and other industries 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  syci  we manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration  oil and gas distribution  oil field drilling  wastewater processing  papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals 
on december   we acquired  through a share exchange  upper class group limited  a british virgin islands holding corporation which then owned all of the outstanding shares of schc 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the share exchange is considered to be a capital transaction in substance  rather than a business combination 
that is  the share exchange is equivalent to the issuance of stock by upper class for the net assets of our company  accompanied by a recapitalization  and is accounted for as a change in capital structure 
accordingly  the accounting for the share exchange was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition  except no goodwill was recorded 
under reverse takeover accounting  the post reverse acquisition comparative historical financial statements of the legal acquirer  our company  are those of the legal acquiree  upper class group limited  which is considered to be the accounting acquirer 
share and per share amounts reflected in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on february   we  acting through schc  acquired syci 
since the ownership of gulf resources  inc and syci was then substantially the same  the transaction was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control  whereby we recognized the assets and liabilities of syci at their carrying amounts 
share and per share amounts stated in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the merger 
on august   syci completed the construction of a new chemical production line 
it passed the examination by shouguang city administration of work safety and local fire department 
this new production line focuses on producing environmental friendly additive products  solid lubricant and polyether lubricant  for use in oil and gas exploration 
the line has an annual production capacity of  tons 
formal production of this chemical production line started on september  on october  we completed a for reverse stock split of our common stock  such that for each four shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after the reverse stock split 
all shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split figures 
on october  our shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol gfre and on june  we changed our ticker symbol to gure to better reflection of our corporate name 
as a result of our acquisitions of schc and syci  our historical financial statements and the information presented below reflects the accounts of schc and syci 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

table of contents bromine segment the decrease in net revenue from our bromine segment was mainly due to the decrease in both the sales volume and selling price of bromine 
the sales volume of bromine decreased from  tonnes for the fiscal year to  tonnes for the same period in  a decrease of  despite the increase in the number of our bromine production plants in recent years  which maintained our production capacity 
as mentioned hereinbefore  the major reason for the decrease in the sales volume of bromine was mainly attributable to the drop in overall demand for bromine as a result of the recent macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government beginning in the second half of to slow down the economy  which has affected our customers industries 
due to the drop in demand of bromine  since the second half of  we needed to offer competitive selling prices to our customers to compete with other bromine manufacturers 
the average selling price of bromine decreased from  per tonne for the fiscal year to  per tonne for the same period in  a decrease of 
the average selling price for the first half of remained relatively stable at around  per tonne and further dropped to  per tonne in the fourth quarter of in order to retain our major customers 
we expect the average selling price of bromine will remain at current levels through the first quarter of should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remain in place 
the table below shows the changes in the average selling price and changes in the sales volume of bromine for the fiscal year from the same period in fiscal year decrease in net revenue of bromine as a result of vs 
decrease in average selling price decrease in sales volume total effect on net revenue of bromine crude salt segment the decrease in net revenue from our crude salt segment was mainly due to the decrease in both the average selling price and sales volume of crude salt 
the average selling price of crude salt decreased from per tonne for the fiscal year to per tonne for the same period in  a decrease of  and the sales volume of crude salt also decreased by from  tonnes for the fiscal year to  tonnes for the same period in the decrease in both the average selling price and sales volume was a result of the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government beginning in the second half of to slow down the economy 
this policy resulted in  among other things  the decrease in the demand for crude salt for downstream production of chlorine alkali and use in chemical  food and beverage industries 
the table below shows the changes in the average selling price and changes in the sales volume of crude salt for the fiscal year from the same period in fiscal year decrease in net revenue of crude salt as a result of vs 
decrease in average selling price decrease in sales volume total effect on net revenue of crude salt we noted a downward trend in the average selling price of crude salt since the first quarter of as we offered competitive selling prices to our customers in order to compete with other crude salt manufacturers 
the average selling price decreased sharply from per tonne in the first quarter of to per tonne in the third quarter of and then maintained at a relatively stable price levels at per tonne through the fourth quarter of we expect the average selling price of crude salt will remain at current levels through the first quarter of should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remain in place 

table of contents chemical products segment product mix of chemical product segment vs 
year ended year ended percent change december  december  of net revenue chemical products percent of total percent of total oil and gas exploration additives paper manufacturing additives pesticides manufacturing additives wastewater treatment chemical products total sales net revenue from our chemical products segment decreased from  for the fiscal year to  for the same period in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the drop in demand for our oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives 
our oil and gas exploration chemicals are the most popular products within the chemical products segment  which contributed  or and  or of the segment revenue for the fiscal year and  respectively  with a decrease of  or 
net revenue from our paper manufacturing additives decreased from  for the fiscal year to  for the same period in  a decrease of approximately 
we believe that as result of the recent macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  the overall demand for chemical products was reduced  which resulted in a decrease in our volume of both oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives sold  which decreased by and  respectively  for the fiscal year as compared with the same period in also  in june we stopped the production of our wastewater treatment chemical additives due to the profit margin lower than estimated by the management 
however  the effect of the decrease in net revenue from our chemical products segment was partially offset by the increase in the average selling price of our pesticides manufacturing additives products due to the strong demand for such products 
the average selling price per tonne for our pesticides manufacturing additives increased by for the fiscal year as compared with the same period in the prc government continued to support expansion of agricultural related products  which supported the growth in sales of our pesticides manufacturing additives 
also  we successfully converted the production equipment from wastewater treatment chemical additive to pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical additives  which contributed higher profit margins as compared to other chemical products 
the table below shows the changes in the average selling price and sales volume of major chemical products wastewater treatment chemical additives excluded for the fiscal year as compared to the same period in increase decrease in net revenue of major chemical products  for fiscal year vs

table of contents cost of net revenue reflects mainly the raw materials consumed and the direct salaries and benefits of staff engaged in the production process  electricity  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and other manufacturing costs 
our cost of net revenue was  for fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately compared to fiscal year the decrease in overall cost of net revenue was mainly attributable to the decrease in volume of raw materials purchased as a result of the decrease in volume of products sold in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  which was partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and increase in purchase price of raw materials 
bromine production capacity and utilization of our factories the table below represents the annual capacity and utilization ratios for all of our bromine producing properties annual production capacity in tonnes utilization ratio ii fiscal year i fiscal year variance of the fiscal year and iii i annual production capacity for the fiscal year was adjusted with the appraisal report carried out by an international appraisal firm  grant sherman appraisal limited  in october ii utilization ratio is calculated based on the annualized actual production volume in tonnes for the periods divided by the annual production capacity in tonnes 
iii the increase in  tonnes production capacity represents the management s estimated capacity of factory no 
acquired in late december our utilization ratio decreased by for the fiscal year as compared with the same period in the decrease in utilization was mainly attributable to the drop in overall demand for bromine as a result of the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  which reduced our sales and production volume since mid in view of the trend of a decrease in the bromine concentration of the brine water being extracted at our production facilities  and in order to reduce the leakage rate and attempt to recover the annual production capacity of bromine and crude salt to a higher level in the future  we decided to carry out large scale enhancement work to replace all the eroded protective shells within a four year timeframe  which commenced in the second quarter of from june through august  we resumed and completed the second phase enhancement works to our existing bromine extraction and crude salt production facilities 
the total cost of the second phase enhancement work to the extraction wells and protective shells to transmission channels and ducts in factories no 
to are approximately  and  respectively  which are capitalized as building and plant and machinery 
we will temporarily stop the third and fourth phase enhancement for factories no 
no 
to the extraction wells and protective shells for transmission channels and ducts  but will focus on enhancement on protective shells for transmission channels and ducts for factories no 
and no  which were acquired in december and november respectively  in order to improve the operation efficiency at estimated costs of million in we estimated that the amount of ordinary repair and maintenance expense will be approximately million in bromine segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our bromine segment was  a decrease of  or compared to  for the fiscal year the most significant components of our cost of net revenue for the bromine segment were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or for fiscal year the most significant components of our cost of net revenue for the bromine segment for fiscal year were cost of raw materials and finished goods consumed of  or  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and electricity of  or  a similar cost structure as compared with the same in the decrease in net cost of net revenue was attributable mainly to the decrease in raw material prices  which is partly offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the table below represents the major production cost component of bromine per ton for respective periods year ended year ended december  december  change percent of total percent of total raw materials depreciation and amortization electricity others production cost of bromine per ton 
table of contents our production cost of bromine per tonne was  for the fiscal year  an increase of or over the same period in  which was attributable mainly to the component of depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the significant percentage increase in depreciation and amortization per tonne by was due to i the enhancement projects since june to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shell and transmission channels and ducts from years to years in june  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery  ii the lower volume of bromine produced as a result of the decrease in demand  which increased the per tonne share of depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery  and iii the second phase enhancement projects in second quarter of to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the construction of new factory no 
in november and acquisition of factory no 
in december  which increased the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
the cost of raw materials consumed per tonne decreased by in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  which was mainly attributable to the decrease in the purchase price of raw materials due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government 
since january  included in our other production cost was a price adjustment fund  a levy charged by the prc government  of rmb approximately per tonne 

table of contents crude salt segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our crude salt segment was  representing an increase of  or  over the same period in the increase in cost was mainly due to the increase in the number of crude salt fields and enhancement projects performed in late june  acquisition of factory no 
in december and the second phase enhancement projects which commenced in june and were completed in august  which in turn increased the depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the significant costs were depreciation and amortization of  or  resource tax calculated based on the crude salt sold of  or and electricity of  or for the fiscal year the significant costs were depreciation and amortization of  or  resource tax calculated based on the crude salt sold of  or and electricity of  or for the fiscal year the table below represents the major production cost component of crude salt per ton for respective periods year ended year ended december  december  change percent of total percent of total depreciation and amortization resource tax electricity others production cost of crude salt per ton our production cost of crude salt per tonne was for the fiscal year  an increase of or as compared to the same period in  which was attributable mainly to the component of depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery 
the significant percentage increase in depreciation and amortization per tonne by was due to i the enhancement projects performed since june to our crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shell and transmission channels and ducts from years to years in late june  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery ii the second phase enhancement project to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts which commenced in june and completed in august  together with the acquisition of factory no 
in december  which increased the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery  and iii the lower volume of crude salt produced  which increased the per tonne share of depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
since the second quarter of  included in our other production cost was a price adjustment fund  a levy charged by prc government since january  of rmb approximately per tonne 
other production costs represented mainly salaries and welfare of labor worked in the crude salt fields 
chemical products segment for the fiscal year  the cost of net revenue for our chemical products segment was  representing a decrease of  or over the same period in the rate of decrease for the cost of net revenue for our chemical products segment was similar to that of net revenue 
the significant costs were cost of raw material and finished goods consumed of  or and  or and depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery of  or and  or for each of the fiscal years and  respectively 
as the components of our cost of net revenue are fixed levels of depreciation and amortization of manufacturing plant and machinery and the inflated purchase price of raw materials  the overall cost of net revenue for chemical products segment remained at a same level for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year gross profit gross profit was  or  of net revenue for fiscal year as compared to  or  of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a drop in margin percentage to all of our three segments 
gross profit by segment point year ended year ended change of december  december  gross profit segment percent of net revenue percent of net revenue bromine crude salt chemical products total gross profit 
table of contents bromine segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our bromine segment was  as compared to for the fiscal year as mentioned in the net revenue discussion above  due to the prc government s macro economic tightening policy to slow down the economy  our selling price and sales volume in the fiscal year was adversely affected 
we cut the average selling price of bromine from  per tonne for the fiscal year to  per tonne for the same period in  a decrease of  in order to compete with other bromine manufacturers 
nevertheless  the sales volume decreased from  tonnes for the fiscal year to  tonnes for the same period in  a decrease of 
also  we completed certain enhancements projects of our facilities since the second quarter of to pump brine water from deeper underground in order to improve the quality of brine water being extracted from our wells  which in turn increased the depreciation and amortization of the plant and equipment and hence the cost of net revenue of bromine 
we also completed the second phase enhancement project to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts in august  together with the acquisition of factory no 
in december  which increased the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
we expect that the average selling price and gross profit margin of bromine will remain at current level towards for the fiscal year should the prc government s macro economic tightening policy remain in place 
crude salt segment for the fiscal year  the gross profit margin for our crude salt segment was as compared to for the same period in this significant decrease in our gross profit margin is attributable to i the increase in depreciation and amortization of manufacturing facilities as a result of the enhancement projects performed since june to our crude fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  ii the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shells and transmission channels and ducts from years to years in late june  and iii the second phase enhancement project to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts which was commenced in june and completed in august  together with the acquisition of factory no 
in december  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery 
for the fiscal year  the average selling price of crude salt amounted to per tonne  as compared to per tonne for the same period in  a decrease of 
as previously mentioned  the decrease in gross profit was a result of the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  which decreased the demand for crude salt for downstream production of chlorine alkali and use in chemical  food and beverage industries 
chemical products segment the gross profit margin for our chemical products segment for the fiscal year was as compared to for the same period in  a decrease of 
as previously mentioned  the decrease in gross profit margin was a result of the decrease in demand for our oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives which in turn reduced the sales volume of these chemical products 
as sales of oil and gas exploration additives contributed more than of our total chemical products segment s net revenue  the decrease in demand largely reduced the gross profit margin of our chemical products segment 
however  the selling price fluctuation of individual chemical products is not expected to have a significant impact on our gross profit margin for overall chemical products as our factory is capable of producing diversified chemical products  such as pesticides manufacturing additives with higher profit margin 
research and development costs the total research and development costs incurred for the fiscal years and were  and  respectively  with a decrease of 
research and development costs for the fiscal year represented raw materials used by syci for testing the manufacturing routine and samples of the new chemical products production line 
research and development costs for the fiscal year were mostly related to the co op research and development center set up jointly with east china university of science and technology in june to develop new bromine based chemical compounds and products to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry  which amounted to  on june   syci and east china university of science and technology mutually agreed to terminate the co op research agreement due to the successful completion of the cooperative research and development tasks related to the development of bromine related chemical products for us 
exploration cost 
no exploration cost was incurred for the fiscal year as we are discussing and negotiating with the local government of daying county of the form of cooperation to further explore the brine water resources 
in the fiscal year  the exploration cost was  representing the drilling of exploratory wells and associated facilities by schc in sichuan province in order to confirm and measure the brine water resources in the province 
we completed the drilling of the first exploratory well in december and announced in mid january that we have discovered underground brine water resources in daying county  and provided preliminary concentration results after the testing by a third party independent testing expert 

table of contents write off impairment on property  plant and equipment 
write off on property  plant and equipment of  for the fiscal year represented the write off of i certain protective shells to transmission pipelines and ducts replaced of  during the second phase enhancement project that started in june and completed in august  and ii certain machinery and equipment replaced during the enhancement work to our bromine production facilities in factory no 
of  that started in july and completed in september the write off and impairment on property  plant and equipment for the fiscal year represented i the write off on property  plant and equipment that could not be relocated to the new factory no 
in the amount of  ii the impairment loss on property  plant and equipment related to the conversion of our production line from wastewater treatment chemical additives to the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical intermediates in the amount of  iii the impairment loss on property  plant and equipment under capital leases for idle plant and machinery in the amount of  and iv the write off of certain crude salt field protective shells and transmission pipelines replaced during enhancement projects in the amounts of  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or as compared to  for the same period in the significant decrease was primarily due to i non cash expenses of  for the fiscal year related to options granted to our employees in the amount of  recognition of non vested options which were cancelled in late september in the amount of  and a warrant issued to our investor relations firm in the amount of  related to a the service agreement signed in february  ii the non cash expenses related to options granted for the fiscal year amounted to  which resulted in a decrease of  or  as compared with the same period in  iii  of unrealized exchange loss in relation to the translation difference of inter company balances in usd and rmb recorded in fiscal year compared to  recorded in fiscal year  and iv  of consultancy fee paid to an unrelated prc agent in fiscal year for the purpose of searching suitable crude salt fields and bromine properties for acquisition 
the decrease in such general and administrative expenses was partially offset by the increase in land use right tax in the amount of  due to the increase in levy rate for fiscal year other operating income 
other operating income was  for the fiscal year  which represented the sales of wastewater to some of our customers in the amount of  the other operating income for the fiscal year represented i a sum of  for sales of wastewater  ii a sum of  for compensation received from a legal case  and iii a sum of  received from the local prc government as compensation for the demolition of our original factory no 
income from operations 
income from operations was  for the fiscal year or of net revenue  a decrease of  or approximately over income from operations for the fiscal year as mentioned hereinbefore  the decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in net revenue as a result of i the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy  which in turn decreased the demand and selling price of our products  and ii the increase in depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery due to the enhancement projects since june to our crude salt fields  extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts  together with the change in the estimated useful life of certain protective shell and transmission channels and ducts from years to years in late june iii the second phase enhancement project to our extraction wells and transmission channels and ducts which commenced in june and completed in august  together with the acquisition of factory no 
in december  which accelerated the depreciation and amortization of the plant and machinery

table of contents crude salt segment income from operations from our crude salt segment was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately as compared to the same period in this decrease was mainly due to i the decrease in both the average selling price and sales volume contributed an aggregate decrease of approximately million  and ii the decrease in the gross profit margin mainly due to the enhancement projects which increased the depreciation of manufacturing facilities of approximately million  which was partially offset by the decrease in write off impairment of property  plant and equipment of approximately million 
chemical products segment income from operations from our chemical products segment was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately over same period in this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in net revenue of our wastewater treatment chemical additives  oil and gas exploration additives and paper manufacturing additives of approximately million due to decreased demand  and ii the decrease in our research and development costs paid to east china university of science and technology of approximately million as explained hereinbefore  which was partially offset by i the increase in net revenue of our pesticides manufacturing additives of approximately million  ii the decrease in cost of net revenue of approximately million as explained hereinbefore and iii the decrease in write off impairment of property  plant and equipment of approximately million 
other income  net

net income was  for the fiscal year  a decrease of  or approximately as compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in demand for our products due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by the prc government to slow down the economy 
effective tax rate 
our effective tax rates for the fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year of differs from the prc statutory income tax rate of due to the us federal net operating loss incurred by the company contributed gap

liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  as of december  the components of this decrease of  are reflected below 
statement of cash flows years ended december net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net cash outflow inflow for the fiscal years and  we met our working capital and capital investment requirements mainly by using cash flows from operations and cash on hand 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities relating to bromine asset purchases and new bromine resource development 
net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended december  and  we had positive cash flow from operating activities of million and million respectively  primarily attributable to net income 

table of contents during the year ended december   cash flow from operating activities of million exceeded our net income of million  which is caused by our net income included substantial non cash charges of million  mainly in the form of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment and write off impairment loss on property  plant and equipment  partially offset by cash used in working capital of million for the fiscal year  mainly consisting of account receivable  inventory and tax paid 
during the year ended december   cash flow from operating activities of million exceeded our net income of million  which is caused by our net income included substantial non cash charges of million  mainly in the form of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization of property  plant and equipment and write off impairment loss on property  plant and equipment  partially offset by cash used in working capital of million for the fiscal year  mainly consisting of inventory and tax paid 
accounts receivable cash collections on our accounts receivable had a major impact on our overall liquidity 
the following table presents the aging analysis of our accounts receivable as of december  and december  december  of total of total aged days aged days aged days aged days aged days total the overall accounts receivable balance as of december  increased by  or  as compared to those as of december  such increase is mainly attributable to the extended settlement days by customers due to the macro economic tightening policy imposed by prc government to slow down the economy  which in turn lengthened the average turnover days of accounts receivable from customers from days for the fiscal year to days for the fiscal year normally  to days credit period is granted to customers with a good repayment history 
we are not aware of any allowances for doubtful debts required for the fiscal year as we have policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history 
for the balances of accounts receivable as of december  aged more than days  was settled in the two months ended february  inventory our inventory consists of the following december  december  percent of total percent of total raw materials finished goods allowance for obsolete and slowing moving inventory total the net inventory level as of december  increased by  or  as compared to the net inventory level as of december  raw materials slightly decreased by as of december  as compared to december  all of the raw materials are basic chemical industry materials  few of which have a possibility of loss over time  or major fluctuations in their prices 
so  we concluded that all of our raw materials as of december  are fully realizable for production of finished goods without any impairment 

table of contents our finished goods mainly composed of bromine  crude salt and chemical products 
our chemical products are similar to raw materials  as there is no loss over time and a stable market price with a positive gross profit margin of for the fiscal year for fiscal year 
therefore  we believe that the realization of the chemical products is 
similarly  as there is no depletion of bromine  we believe that the realization of it is also 
although the gross profit margin for the fiscal year decreased to  as compared with in fiscal year  we anticipate that the price in the fiscal year of will not fluctuate significantly to impair the cost of bromine 
the annual loss of crude salt due to evaporation is around 
although the market price of crude salt decreased from per tonne in first quarter of to per tonne in the fourth quarter of  the gross margin is still attractive as the relative cost of production is low  we believe that there will be no realizability problem for crude salt and its selling price should not be lower than its cost 
net cash used in investing activities in the fiscal year  we used approximately million cash for the prepayment of land leases 
we also used approximately million cash to acquire property  plant and equipment for the fiscal year  which included i the second phase enhancement project to the extraction wells and protective shells to transmission channels and ducts in factories no 
to in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  ii the enhancement work to the bromine production facilities in factory no 
at a cost of approximately million  iii the enhancement work to the chemical products production facilities at a cost of approximately million  iv the purchase of five stories of a commercial building  from a company in which mr 
ming yang  the chairman of the company  had a equity interest  as our new headquarters at a cost of approximately million  v the renovation for the five stories of a commercial building at a cost of million  and vi the acquisition of factory no 
at a cost of approximately million by cash 
the above investing activities were financed by the opening cash balances as of december  and cash generated from operation during the fiscal year net cash used in provided by financing activities we repaid approximately million cash for our capital lease obligation for the fiscal year in the fiscal year  we repaid approximately million cash for our capital lease obligation and used another million to repurchase  shares of common stock of the company under the approval of the board of directors 
we believe that our available funds and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs for the next twelve months 
however we will likely need to raise additional capital in order to fund the ongoing program of acquiring unlicensed bromine properties  increasing our chemical production capacity and developing new bromine and crude salt production line in sichuan province  prc 
we expect to raise those funds through credit facilities obtained with lending institutions 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such funding  whether through the issuance of debt or equity  on terms satisfactory to management and our board of directors 
working capital was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was mainly attributable to the cash provided by operating activities and the increase in accounts receivable during the fiscal year 
table of contents we had available cash of approximately million at december   most of which is in highly liquid current deposits which earn no or little interest 
we intend to retain the cash for future expansion of our bromine and crude salt businesses through acquisition  enhancement works to our existing bromine and crude salt business  and exploration cost of new brine water resources in sichuan province  and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in the future we intend to focus our efforts on the activities of schc and syci as these segments continue to expand within the chinese market 
we also intend to explore the possibility of cooperation with overseas large scale bromine manufacturers for expansion into overseas markets 
as a result  we may issue additional shares of our capital stock and incur new debt in order to raise cash for acquisitions and other capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
we may not be able to identify  successfully integrate or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire  or any expansion of our business 
an expansion may involve a number of risks  including possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management attention  inability to retain key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated events and the financial statement effect of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of operations 
in addition  if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase  the cost of acquiring businesses could increase materially 
we may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable  under managed  or in its early stages of development or growth
