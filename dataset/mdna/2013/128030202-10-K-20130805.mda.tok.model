item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities 
additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us  that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
market prices of wholesale shell eggs are volatile and decreases in these prices can adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
as a result  our prior performance should not be presumed to be an accurate indication of future performance 
small increases in production  or small decreases in demand  can have a large adverse effect on shell egg prices 
shell egg prices trended upward from calendar until late and early when they rose to historical highs 
in the early fall of calendar  the demand trend related to the increased popularity of high protein diets faded dramatically and prices fell 
during the time of increased demand  the egg industry geared up to produce more eggs  resulting in an oversupply of eggs 
since calendar  supplies appear to be more closely balanced with demand and egg prices again reached record levels in and egg prices have generally retreated from those record price levels due to increases in industry supply 
there can be no assurance that shell egg prices will remain at or near current levels or that the supply of and demand for shell eggs will remain level in the future retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest in the summer months 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
a decline in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business 
we believe fast food restaurant consumption  reports from the medical community regarding the health benefits of shell eggs  reduced shell egg cholesterol levels  high protein diet trends and industry advertising campaigns have all contributed to shell egg demand 
however  there can be no assurance that the demand for shell eggs will not decline in the future 
adverse publicity relating to health concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional value of shell eggs  as well as movement away from high protein diets  could adversely affect demand for shell eggs  which would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
feed costs are volatile and increases in these costs can adversely impact our results of operations 
feed cost represents the largest element of our shell egg farm production cost  ranging from to of total farm production cost in the last five years 
although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources  we have little  if any  control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase  which are affected by weather  various supply and demand factors  transportation and storage costs  and agricultural and energy policies in the us and internationally 
for example  the severe drought in the summer of and resulting damage to the national corn crop resulted in high and volatile feed costs 
increases in feed costs unaccompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
alternatively  low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction  possibly resulting in lower egg prices 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  our financial results from year to year and between different quarters within a single fiscal year may fluctuate 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
additionally  as a result of seasonal fluctuations  our financial results may fluctuate significantly between different quarters within a single fiscal year 
we purchase approximately of the shell eggs we sell from outside producers and our ability to obtain such eggs at prices and in quantities acceptable to us could fluctuate 
we produce approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us and purchase the remaining amount from outside producers 
as the wholesale price for shell eggs increases  our cost to acquire shell eggs from outside producers increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire shell eggs from outside producers in sufficient quantities and satisfactory prices  and our inability to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
our acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks 
we plan to continue to pursue a growth strategy  which includes acquisitions of other companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs 
for example  in fiscal year we completed the acquisitions of the commercial egg assets of pilgrim s pride corporation and maxim production co  inc acquisitions require capital resources and can divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct prior to our acquisition of a business that were unknown to us at the time of acquisition 
we could incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we anticipated at the time of its purchase 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  or can successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of an acquired business 
no assurance can be given that companies acquired by us in the future will contribute positively to our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  federal antitrust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance 
the consideration we pay in connection with any acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we pay cash  we could be required to use a portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisition 
to the extent we issue shares of our common stock  existing stockholders may be diluted 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt 
our largest customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume 
accordingly  our business may be adversely affected by the loss of  or reduced purchases by  one or more of our large customers 
for the fiscal years   and  two affiliated customers  wal mart stores and sam s clubs  on a combined basis  accounted for   and of our net sales dollars  respectively 
for fiscal years   and  our top ten customers accounted for   and of net sales dollars  respectively 
although we have established long term relationships with most of our customers  who continue to purchase from us based on our ability to service their needs  they are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources 
if  for any reason  one or more of our larger customers were to purchase significantly less of our shell eggs in the future or terminate their purchases from us  and we are not able to sell our shell eggs to new customers at comparable levels  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations  including environmental regulations  could harm our operating results  financial condition  and reputation 
further  we may incur significant costs to comply with any such regulations 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations relating to grading  quality control  labeling  sanitary control  and waste disposal 
as a fully integrated shell egg producer  our shell egg facilities are subject to usda and fda regulation  as well as regulation by various state and local health and agricultural agencies 
our shell egg processing facilities are subject to periodic usda and fda inspections 
all of our shell egg and feed mill facilities are subject to fda regulation and inspections 
our operations and facilities are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  handling  use  transportation  disposal  and remediation of hazardous materials 
under these laws and regulations  we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities  including  but not limited to wastewater discharge permits 
if we fail to comply with an applicable law or regulation  or fail to obtain necessary permits  we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions  our reputation could be harmed  and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future 
shell eggs and shell egg products are susceptible to microbial contamination  and we may be required to or voluntarily recall contaminated products 
shell eggs and shell egg products are vulnerable to contamination by pathogens such as salmonella 
shipment of contaminated products  even if inadvertent  could result in a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies 
in addition  products purchased from other producers could contain contaminants that may be inadvertently redistributed by us 
as such  we may decide or be required to recall a product if we or regulators believe it poses a potential health risk 
in fiscal  there were two separate occasions where we voluntarily recalled shell eggs that we purchased from other producers 
none of the recalled eggs were produced at cal maine facilities 
we do not maintain insurance to cover recall losses 
recall costs in fiscal were not material  but there is no guarantee future costs will not be 
any product recall could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products  adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
agricultural risks  including outbreaks of avian disease  could harm our business 
our shell egg production activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
unusual or extreme weather conditions  disease and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs we produce and distribute 
the company maintains controls and procedures to reduce the risk of exposing our flocks to harmful diseases 
despite our best efforts  outbreaks of avian disease can still occur and may adversely impact the health of our flocks 
in addition  an outbreak of avian disease could have a material adverse impact on our financial results by increasing government restrictions on the sale and distribution of our products 
negative publicity from an outbreak within our industry can negatively impact customer perception  even if the outbreak does not directly impact our flocks 
if a substantial portion of our production facilities are affected by any of these factors in any given quarter or year  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive 
the production and sale of fresh shell eggs  which have accounted for virtually all of our net sales in recent years  is intensely competitive 
we compete with a large number of competitors that may prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling shell eggs 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with any or all of these companies 
in addition  increased competition could result in price reductions  greater cyclicality  reduced margins and loss of market share  which would negatively affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
pressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices and protect our image with our customers 
we and many of our customers are facing pressure from animal rights groups  such as people for the ethical treatment of animals  or peta  and hsus  to require that all companies that supply food products operate their business in a manner that treats animals in conformity with certain standards developed or approved by these animal rights groups 
as a result  we are reviewing and changing our operating procedures with respect to our flocks of hens to address these concerns 
the treatment standards require  among other things  that we provide minimum cage space for our hens and modify beak trimming and forced molting practices the act of putting chickens into a regeneration cycle 
these groups have made legislative efforts to ban any form of caged housing in various states 
changing our procedures and infrastructure to conform to these guidelines has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs to our internal production of shell eggs  including cost increases from housing and feeding the increased flock population resulting from the modification of molting practices  and the cost for us to purchase shell eggs from our outside suppliers 
while some of the increased costs have been passed on to our customers  we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to pass on these costs  or additional costs we will face  in the future 
on july   the hsus and uep reached an agreement to work together toward the enactment of comprehensive federal legislation for all of the approximately million hens involved in us egg production 
the two groups jointly asked congress for federal legislation  which would require egg producers to increase the space per hen in a tiered phase in  with the amount of space hens are given increasing  in intervals  over the next to years 
currently  the majority of hens are each provided square inches of space  with roughly million receiving square inches 
the proposed phase in would culminate with hens nationwide being provided a minimum of square inches of space  along with certain other improvements noted in the july  agreement 
we cannot predict the likelihood that this legislation will become law  however  if this federal legislation is passed we could incur significant costs to conform our operations to meet the requirements of this proposed legislation 
we do not have a current estimate of what these costs will be if this legislation is passed 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may adversely affect the implementation of our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss or interruption of service of one or more of our key executive officers could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations effectively and or pursue our growth strategy 
we have not entered into any employment or non compete agreements with any of our executive officers nor do we carry any significant key man life insurance coverage on any such persons 
we are controlled by a principal stockholder 
fred r 
adams  jr  our founder and chairman emeritus  and his spouse own of the outstanding shares of our common stock  which has one vote per share 
in addition  mr 
adams owns and his son in law  adolphus b 
baker  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  owns of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock  which has ten votes per share 
mr 
baker and his spouse also own of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  currently mr 
adams and his spouse possess  and messrs 
adams and baker and their spouses collectively possess  of the total voting power represented by the outstanding shares of our common stock and class a common stock 
these stockholdings include shares of our common stock accumulated under our employee stock ownership plan for the respective accounts of messrs 
adams and baker 
the adams family intends to retain ownership of a sufficient amount of common stock and class a common stock to assure its continued ownership of over of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock 
such ownership will make an unsolicited acquisition of us more difficult and discourage certain types of transactions involving a change of control of our company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation require that our class a common stock be issued only to fred r 
adams  jr 
and members of his immediate family  and if shares of our class a common stock  by operation of law or otherwise  are deemed not to be owned by mr 
adams or a member of his immediate family  the voting power of any such shares shall be automatically reduced to one vote per share 
the adams family s controlling ownership of our capital stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
based on mr 
adams beneficial ownership of our outstanding capital stock  we are a controlled company  as defined in rule c of the nasdaq s listing standards 
accordingly  we are exempt from certain requirements of nasdaq s corporate governance listing standards  including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and the nomination of directors by independent directors 
current and any future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and although we believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters  we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
for example  on july  we announced that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle certain antitrust claims pending against us 
for a discussion of legal proceedings  including the settlement  see item below 
such lawsuits are expensive to defend  divert management s attention  and may result in significant judgments or settlements 
legal proceedings may expose us to negative publicity  which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference for our products and brands 
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
as of june   we had million of goodwill 
while we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired  any future goodwill impairment charges could materially adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period or our net worth 
the loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us 
we utilize intellectual property in our business 
for example  we own the trade names farmhouse  rio grande  sunups  sunny meadow and grain 
we also produce and market egg land s best and land o lakes under license agreements with ebllc 
we have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands 
the loss or expiration of any intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us by allowing our competitors to make and sell products substantially similar to those we offer 
this could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell the associated products  thereby adversely affecting our operations

we have the ability to hatch million pullet chicks annually  grow million pullets annually  house million laying hens  and control the production of million layers  with the remainder controlled by contract growers 
we own mills that can produce tons of feed per hour  and processing facilities capable of processing  cases of shell eggs per hour with each case containing dozen shell eggs 
over the past five fiscal years  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions of shell egg production and processing facilities from others  have totaled an aggregate amount of approximately million 
item legal proceedings chicken litter litigation cal maine farms  inc is presently a defendant in two personal injury cases in the circuit court of washington county  arkansas 
those cases are styled  mcwhorter vs 
alpharma  inc  et al  and carroll  et al 
vs 
alpharma  inc  et al 
cal maine farms  inc 
was named as a defendant in the mcwhorter case on february  it was named as a defendant in the carroll case on may  co defendants in both cases include other integrated poultry companies such as tyson foods  inc  cargill  incorporated  george s farms  inc  peterson farms  inc  simmons foods  inc  and simmons poultry farms  inc 
the manufacturers of an additive for broiler feed are also included as defendants 
those defendants are alpharma  inc and alpharma animal health  co 
both cases allege that the plaintiffs have suffered medical problems resulting from living near land upon which litter from the defendants flocks was spread as fertilizer 
the mcwhorter case focuses on mold and fungi allegedly created by the application of litter 
the carroll case also alleges injury from mold and fungi  but focuses primarily on the broiler feed ingredient as the cause of the alleged medical injuries 
each of these cases has now been largely resolved by settlements immaterial to the company  and management believes the risk of material loss to the company from resolution of the remaining matters in these cases is remote 
state of oklahoma watershed pollution litigation on june   the state of oklahoma filed suit  in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma  against cal maine foods  inc and cal maine farms  inc 
as well as tyson foods  inc and affiliates  cobb vantress  inc  cargill  inc 
and its affiliate  george s  inc and its affiliate  peterson farms  inc 
and simmons foods  inc cal maine farms  inc 
was dismissed from the case in september the state of oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the illinois river watershed 
this watershed provides water to eastern oklahoma 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages  but the claim for monetary damages has been dismissed by the court 
cal maine foods  inc discontinued operations in the watershed 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that cal maine foods  inc will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief unless the court orders substantial affirmative remediation 
since the litigation began  cal maine foods  inc purchased of the membership interests of benton county foods  llc  which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the illinois river watershed 
benton county foods  llc is not a defendant in the litigation 
the trial in the case began in september and concluded in february the case was tried to the court without a jury and the court has not yet issued its ruling 
management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote 
egg antitrust litigation since september   the company has been named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the united states shell egg industry 
in some of these cases  the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased eggs or egg products directly from a defendant and have sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated 
in other cases  the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products directly from one or more of the defendants but sue only for their own alleged damages and not on behalf of a putative class 
in the remaining cases  the named plaintiffs are individuals or companies who allege that they purchased shell eggs and egg products indirectly from one or more of the defendants that is  they purchased from retailers that had previously purchased from defendants or other parties and have sued on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others who claim to be similarly situated 
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated all of the putative class actions as well as certain other cases in which the company was not a named defendant for pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the pennsylvania court has organized the putative class actions around two groups direct purchasers and indirect purchasers and has named interim lead counsel for the named plaintiffs in each group 
there are now seven non class suits pending 
six of the non class suits are pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the other non class suit is pending in district court of wyandotte county  kansas 
the plaintiffs in two other non class suits originally filed in the eastern district of pennsylvania voluntarily dismissed their suits without prejudice 
the plaintiffs in two other non class suits originally filed in the eastern district of pennsylvania voluntarily dismissed their suits without prejudice 
the direct purchaser putative class action 
the direct purchaser cases were consolidated into in re processed egg products antitrust litigation  no 
md gp  in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss direct purchaser class plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations but did so without prejudice to the plaintiffs right to seek leave to further amend their complaint if they  in good faith  believe they can address the deficiencies noted by the court 
the direct purchasers filed an amended complaint  and the company filed a renewed motion to dismiss the claims in the new complaint that are barred by the four year statute of limitations 
the court has granted final approval to two settlements in these cases 
in one settlement  the settling party will not pay any money to the putative class 
instead  the settling defendant  while denying all liability and while remaining a defendant in certain non class cases  will provide cooperation in the form of documents and witness interviews to the direct class plaintiffs attorneys 
in the other settlement  the settling defendant will pay a total of million and would provide other consideration in the form of documents  witness interviews  and declarations 
this settling defendant denied all liability in its agreement with the direct purchaser class plaintiffs and stated publicly that it settled merely to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation 
on july   we announced that we have reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter 
see proposed settlement of the direct purchaser putative class action below the indirect purchaser putative class action 
the indirect purchaser cases were consolidated into in re processed egg products antitrust litigation  no 
md gp  in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the court granted with prejudice the defendants renewed motion to dismiss claims arising outside the limitations period applicable to most causes of action 
discovery is ongoing in this case 
the non class cases 
six of the cases in which plaintiffs do not seek to certify a class have been consolidated with the putative class actions into in re processed egg products antitrust litigation  no 
md gp  in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the direct plaintiffs claims for damages outside the four year statute of limitations but did so without prejudice to the plaintiffs right to seek leave to further amend their complaint if they  in good faith  believe they can address the deficiencies noted by the court 
the direct plaintiffs have filed further amended complaints  and the company has filed a renewed motion to dismiss the claims in the new complaint that are barred by the four year statute of limitations 
discovery is ongoing in this case 
on january   the company filed its answer and affirmative defenses in the non class case pending in kansas state court styled as associated wholesale grocers  inc  et al  v 
united egg producers  et al  no 
cv  and the company joined other defendants in the kansas case in moving to dismiss all claims for damages arising outside the three year statute of limitations period and all claims for damages arising from purchases of eggs and egg products outside the state of kansas 
the court took under advisement the limitations motion  pending a ruling in another case that will determine whether the limitations period in the kansas case will be three or five years 
the court reserved judgment on the motion to dismiss claims for damages arising from purchases of eggs and egg products outside the state of kansas until discovery reveals which sales occurred within kansas 
in reserving judgment  the court stated that only sales within kansas would be relevant to any calculation of alleged damages 
discovery is ongoing in this case 
allegations in each case 
in all of the antitrust cases described above  the plaintiffs allege that the company and certain other large domestic egg producers conspired to reduce the domestic supply of eggs in a concerted effort to raise the price of eggs to artificially high levels 
in each case  plaintiffs allege that all defendants agreed to reduce the domestic supply of eggs by a manipulating egg exports and b implementing industry wide animal welfare guidelines that reduced the number of hens and eggs 
both groups of named plaintiffs in the putative class actions seek treble damages and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and all other putative class members in the united states 
both groups of named plaintiffs in the putative class actions allege a class period starting on january  and running through the present 
the direct purchaser putative class action case alleges two separate sub classes one for direct purchasers of shell eggs and one for direct purchasers of egg products 
the direct purchaser putative class action case seeks relief under the sherman act 
the indirect purchaser putative class action case seeks injunctive relief under the sherman act and damages under the statutes and common law of various states and the district of columbia 
seven non class cases remain pending 
in five of the remaining non class cases  the plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under the sherman act 
in one of the remaining non class cases  the plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief under the sherman act and the ohio antitrust act known as the valentine act 
in the other remaining non class case  the plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under the kansas restraint of trade act 
the pennsylvania court has entered a series of orders related to case management  discovery  class certification  and scheduling 
the pennsylvania court has not set a trial date for any of the consolidated cases 
the kansas state court has entered a schedule for discovery and dispositive motions 
the kansas state court case is set for trial starting june  proposed settlement of the direct purchaser putative class action 
on july   the company announced that it has reached an agreement in principle to settle all direct purchaser class claims against the company in the above described direct purchaser putative class action 
pursuant to the agreement in principle  which is subject to finalization by the parties and court approval  the company would be obligated to pay million to fully and finally resolve these claims 
the other terms and conditions of the proposed settlement are not expected to have a material impact to the company s results of operations 
the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million  which amounts to million  per basic share  after tax with respect to the proposed settlement 
this settlement does not affect the indirect purchaser putative class action and does not necessarily resolve the seven non class cases still pending 
the company intends to continue to defend these cases as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the company believes are meritorious and provable 
while management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse outcome in the overall egg antitrust litigation has been significantly reduced  assuming the court approves the proposed settlement  there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome in the remaining egg antitrust litigation 
at the present time  however  it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure  if any  to the company because of these cases 
accordingly  adjustments  if any  which might result from the resolution of these remaining legal matters  have not been reflected in the financial statements 
florida civil investigative demand on november   the company received an antitrust civil investigative demand from the attorney general of the state of florida 
the demand seeks production of documents and responses to interrogatories relating to the production and sale of eggs and egg products 
the company is cooperating with this investigation and entered into a tolling agreement with the state of florida to extend any applicable statute of limitations for one year from the date of the agreement 
no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the company in this matter 
environmental information request in july  the company received an information request request from the united states environmental protection agency epa pursuant to section of the clean water act act 
the request stated that the information was sought by the epa to investigate compliance with the act and requested information pertaining to facilities involved in animal feeding operations  which are owned or operated by the company or its affiliates 
on october   the company timely responded to the request by providing information on each of the subject facilities 
the epa subsequently sent a notice of noncompliance notice dated march  to the company which involved allegations of potential non compliance with the request and or the act 
the notice related to the company s edwards  mississippi facility only 
the company timely responded to the notice on may  the epa and the mississippi department of environmental quality mdeq provided certain preliminary findings to the company alleging potential violations of the act and or the mississippi air and water pollution control law concerning unpermitted discharges of pollutants to water of the united states and or mississippi and violations of certain conditions established under the company s national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit for the edwards  mississippi facility 
the company is cooperating with the epa and mdeq in their investigations and  to facilitate settlement negotiations regarding the alleged violations  has entered into an amended tolling agreement for the period commencing january  and ending september   which would not be included in computing the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any action brought by the united states and or mississippi 
although management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility of loss in this matter  we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss due to the stage of the matter and complexity of the issues involved 
irs voluntary compliance the company has filed an irs voluntary compliance filing to correct salary deferral contribution discrepancies which were found during the audit 
the company is responsible for contributing makeup contributions and earnings to the cal maine foods  inc savings and retirement plan 
the total amount calculated to correct the contribution problem was million as of december  as part of the voluntary compliance correction  the company has already contributed  to the cal maine foods  inc savings and retirement plan as makeup contributions and lost earnings 
at issue is approximately  plus earnings on that amount from december  until a final correction is approved 
the internal revenue service could waive all or part of the additional makeup contribution and lost earnings as part of the voluntary compliance program filing correction 
the additional amount required to be contributed is being negotiated with the internal revenue service as part of the internal revenue service review of the correction filing 
miscellaneous in addition to the above  the company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business 
although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty  management  upon the advice of counsel  is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
at this time  it is not possible for us to predict the ultimate outcome of the matters set forth above

overview cal maine foods  inc we  us  our  or the company is primarily engaged in the production  grading  packaging  marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs 
our fiscal year end is the saturday nearest to may which was june  weeks  june  weeks  and may  weeks for the most recent three fiscal years 
our operations are fully integrated 
we hatch chicks  grow and maintain flocks of pullets young female chickens  under weeks of age  layers mature female chickens and breeders male or female birds used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks  manufacture feed  and produce  process and distribute shell eggs 
we are the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the us we market the majority of our shell eggs in the southwestern  southeastern  mid western  and mid atlantic regions of the us we market our shell eggs through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers  including national and regional grocery store chains  club stores  foodservice distributors  and egg product manufacturers 
our operating results are directly tied to egg prices  which are highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations  and are outside of our control 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
in the past  during periods of high profitability  shell egg producers tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs  which generally caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand returned to balance 
as a result  our financial results from year to year may vary significantly 
shorter term  retail sales of shell eggs historically have been greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months 
our need for working capital generally is highest in the last and first fiscal quarters ending in may and august  respectively  when egg prices are normally at seasonal lows 
prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal factors and a natural increase in shell egg production during the spring and early summer 
shell egg prices tend to increase with the start of the school year and are highest prior to holiday periods  particularly thanksgiving  christmas  and easter 
consequently  we generally experience lower sales and net income in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in august and may  respectively 
because of the seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons 
for fiscal  we produced approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us  with approximately of such shell egg production being provided by contract producers 
contract producers utilize their facilities in the production of shell eggs by layers owned by us 
we own the shell eggs produced under these arrangements 
for fiscal  approximately of the total number of shell eggs sold by us was purchased from outside producers for resale 
our cost of production is materially affected by feed costs 
for fiscal  feed costs averaged about of our total farm egg production cost 
changes in market prices for corn and soybean meal  the primary ingredients in the feed we use  result in changes in our cost of goods sold 
the cost of our feed ingredients  which are commodities  are subject to factors over which we have little or no control such as volatile price changes caused by weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs  demand and the agricultural and energy policies of the us and foreign governments 
drought conditions in the major crop growing areas of the us in the summer of significantly reduced yields for the corn and soybean crops in the crop year creating tight supplies and record prices 
improved weather and higher expected crop yields for the crop year should improve the supply situation and provide some price relief for our primary feed ingredients  although the outlook is for feed costs to remain volatile the purchases of the commercial egg assets of pilgrim s pride corporation and maxim production co  inc as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements are referred to below as the acquisitions 
our fiscal financial results include the results of pilgrim s pride beginning august  and maxim beginning november  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
percentage of net sales fiscal years ended june  june  may  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses legal settlement expense operating income other income income before taxes income tax expense net income including noncontrolling interests less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to cal maine foods  inc executive overview of results june   june   and may  our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices and feed costs  which can fluctuate widely and are outside of our control 
the majority of our shell eggs are sold at prices related to the urner barry spot egg market quotations for the southeastern region of the country  or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal 
the following table shows our net income  net average shell egg selling price  feed cost per dozen produced  and the average urner barry wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region  for each of our three most recent fiscal years 
fiscal year ended june  june  may  net income attributable to cal maine foods  inc in thousands net average shell egg selling price rounded feed cost per dozen produced average urner barry spot egg market quotations 

average daily price for the large market ie generic shell egg in the southeastern region 
the shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss 
the periods of high profitability reflect increased consumer demand relative to supply while the periods of significant loss reflect excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand 
historically  demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth 
as reflected above  our operating results correspond with changes in the spot egg market quote 
the net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
in fiscal and  shell egg demand increased at higher than normal trend rates due to the increased popularity of high protein diets 
this demand imbalance caused shell egg prices to increase 
in late fiscal  the popularity of these high protein diets began to diminish  but our egg production had been increased to meet the earlier higher demand levels 
lower egg prices followed  and we experienced net losses in fiscal and beginning in the latter part of fiscal  egg supplies became more aligned with demand 
since that time  the supply demand balance generally tightened 
in fiscal  our net average selling price increased slightly over the previous fiscal year  but due to higher feed costs our net income decreased 
for fiscal  our net average selling price increased and feed costs increased significantly from the prior year 
in fiscal year feed costs continued to increase significantly and our average net selling price increased compared to the prior year 
net income decreased significantly compared to the prior year  primarily due to the receipt of a special patronage dividend in fiscal related to a joint venture between eb and land o lakes  inc and legal settlement expenses in fiscal related to antitrust litigation see notes   and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales consisted of shell egg sales  approximately was for sales of egg products  with the balance consisting of sales of incidental feed and feed ingredients

our net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs  including non graded shell egg sales  breaking stock and undergrades 
our operating results are significantly affected by wholesale shell egg market prices  which are outside of our control 
small changes in production or demand levels can have a large effect on shell egg prices

off balance sheet arrangements the company owns of the membership interests in delta egg farm  llc delta egg

delta egg s long term debt is secured by substantially all the fixed assets of delta egg and is due in monthly installments through july delta egg is engaged in the production  processing  and distribution of shell eggs 
the other owner guarantees of the debt 
payment under the guarantee would be required if delta egg is not able to pay the debt

total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal over years long term debt principal    long term debt interest    legal settlement expense operating leases  total      impact of recently issued accounting standards for information on changes in accounting principles and new accounting principles  see impact of recently issued accounting standards in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management suggests our summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  generally for amounts more than days past due 
inventories inventories of eggs  feed  supplies and livestock are valued principally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower  we would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value 
the cost associated with flock inventories  consisting principally of chick purchases  feed  labor  contractor payments and overhead costs  are accumulated during the growing period of approximately weeks 
capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the productive lives of the flocks  generally one to two years 
flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal adjustments to write down flock inventories 
management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and improvements and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and improvements and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
we continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
investment in affiliates we have invested in other companies engaged in the production  processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from less than to 
therefore  these investments are recorded using the cost or the equity method  and accordingly  not consolidated in our financial statements 
changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used 
our investment in these companies amounted to million at june  the combined total assets and total liabilities of these companies were approximately million and million  respectively  at june  we are a guarantor of approximately million of long term debt of one of our affiliates 
goodwill at june   our goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill relates to the following fiscal period description amount acquisition of hudson brothers  inc  acquisition of hillandale farms  llc acquisition of green forest foods  llc revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale  revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale  acquisition of zephyr egg  llc  acquisition of tampa farms  llc  revision to purchase price for incremental purchase of hillandale acquisition of maxim production co 
 total goodwill  goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  if we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we do not perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment 
income taxes we determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we are periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s commodity price risk our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of eggs  corn and soybean meal  which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control 
for example  feed costs  which during fiscal averaged of our total farm egg production cost  increased per dozen produced year over year 
we are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as generic shell egg prices 
the following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed cost per dozen feed ingredient approximate change in feed ingredient cost approximate impact on feed costs per dozen approximate dollar impact on farm production cost for the current fiscal year corn change in the average market price per bushel soybean meal change in the average market price per ton interest rate risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain all of our debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a adverse move decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the net fair value of our debt by million at june  we are a party to no other material market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
