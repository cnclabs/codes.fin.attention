item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc we are a leading provider of automated solutions for medication and supply management in healthcare 
our automation and analytics solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical surgical supplies and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  reduce operating costs  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
approximately  hospitals utilize one or more of our products  of which more than  hospitals in the united states have installed our automated hardware software solutions for controlling  dispensing  acquiring  verifying  tracking and analyzing medications and medical and surgical supplies 
approximately  institutional and retail pharmacies utilize our medication adherence packaging solutions 
we sell our medication control systems together with related consumables and services  and medical and surgical supply control systems and generate the majority of our revenue in the united states 
however  we expect our revenue from our international operations to increase in future periods as we continue to grow our international business 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada  and for a portion of our products in the united kingdom and germany 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
we have not sold in the past  and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the us department of state  and are subject to economic sanctions and export controls 
in may  we completed our acquisition of medpak holdings  inc medpak 
medpak is the parent company of mts medication technologies  inc mts  a worldwide provider of medication adherence packaging systems 
this acquisition aligns us with the long term trends of the healthcare market to manage the health of patients across the continuum of care giving us the ability to serve both the acute and non acute markets 
omnicell and mts bring capabilities to each other that strengthen the product lines and expand the medication management coverage of both companies 
please refer to note  business acquisition to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information regarding the transaction 
in connection with this acquisition  we realigned our management reporting structure to identify those dispensing systems and other related business transactions that are sold into long term care pharmacies and facilities 
accordingly  the operations of this portion of our activities are now being reflected as a part of the non acute care segment for the year ended december  please refer to note  segments to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information regarding the results for both the acute care and non acute care segments 
in the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement with our distributor in the united kingdom to purchase of its outstanding equity for approximately million in cash to accelerate the adoption of medication and supply automation in the united kingdom 
in connection with the investment  we have the right  under certain circumstances  to appoint a member to this company board of directors as well as certain other voting rights 
as a result of these and other factors  we are accounting for this investment using the equity method 
our proportionate equity share of the income of this distributor recognized in our financial statements for the year ended december  was immaterial 
we are working to develop relationships with major providers of hospital information management systems with the goal of enhancing the interoperability of our products with their systems 
we believe that enhanced interoperability will help reduce implementation costs  time  and maintenance for shared clients  while providing new clinical workflows designed to enhance efficiency and patient safety 
our revenue increased by to million in the twelve month period ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the million increase in revenues from to  million was attributable to an increase in product revenues for as compared with  reflecting increased completed installations of 
table of contents our new automation products  increases in lease renewals from existing customers  and revenue derived from our acquisition of mts  during the second quarter of  which comprises the predominant portion of our non acute care segment 
service revenues increased by million in as compared with  primarily due to growth in the installed customer base 
for the year ended december   our acute care segment contributed million and million in product and service revenue  respectively 
this compares to product and service revenue of million and million for the acute care segment in for the year ended december   the non acute care segment contributed million and million in product and service revenue  respectively 
non acute care revenues were not significant for the year ended december  and  accordingly  have been included in the acute care segment for that period 
we believe that demand for our products in future periods will be based on our expectation that the overall market demand for healthcare services will increase as the population grows  life expectancies continue to increase  the quality of healthcare services increases and the availability of healthcare services increases  our expectation that the environment of increased patient safety awareness  increased regulatory control and increased need for workflow efficiency through the adoption of technology in the healthcare industry will make our solutions a priority in the capital budgets of healthcare facilities  our continued ability to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to provide the best customer experience in the healthcare industry  and our delivery of industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses  pharmacists  supply chain managers  chief information officers and hospital management 
our product backlog  consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  increased million  to million at december  from million as of december  this backlog is primarily attributable to our acute care segment 
we expect to operate through with our backlog within our objective of the next six to nine months  but we believe there will be variation from time to time 
we expect non acute care product backlog to be minimal 
our key business strategies include further penetrating the existing market for our products through sustaining technological leadership in our products by consistently innovating our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
increasing penetration of the international market by bringing new products and technologies to market that are specific to international markets  building direct sales  distribution or other capabilities when and where it is appropriate  partnering with companies that have sales  distribution  or other capabilities that we do not possess in non us geographies  and increasing customer awareness of safety issues in the administration of medications 
expanding our product offering through acquisitions and partnerships 
our healthcare customers expect a high degree of partnership involvement from their technology suppliers 
we provide extensive installation planning and consulting as part of every product sale 
our customers medication control systems are mission critical to their success and our customers require these systems to be functional at all times 
to help assure the maximum availability of our systems  our customers typically purchase maintenance and support contracts in one  two or five year increments 
our long term liabilities include long term deferred service revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  our deferred service revenue will be amortized to service revenue as the service contracts are executed 
in  our overall cash flow decreased million 
this was primarily due to our acquisition of mts for million  and offset by a million increase in net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation and amortization of million  and share based compensation of million and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
other factors during the year ended december  
table of contents impacting the change in cash were increases in accounts receivable of million  deferred service revenues of million  deferred gross profit of million  prepaid expenses of million and net investment in sales type leases of million 
additional uses of cash during the year ended december  included million for the acquisition and development of productive long lived assets and million for stock repurchase activities 
in  we generated positive overall cash flow of million 
this was primarily due to our million of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses associated with depreciation and amortization of million  and share based compensation of million  and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
additional factors were strong cash collections  reducing accounts receivable at year end by million as compared to and increases of million of deferred service revenue and million of deferred gross profit 
these increases to cash were offset by a million increase in inventory  primarily related to the g launch  million for the acquisition and development of productive long lived assets and million in stock repurchase activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was million  and our cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million as compared to million at december  we expect cash provided by operations to remain positive in our full time headcount of  on december  increased by from our full time headcount on december   primarily due to the addition of employees in connection with the acquisition of mts 
we record compensation expense from our share based awards  options and our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  stock compensation 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in gross profit from product revenues increased by million and gross profit from service revenues increased by million 
our gross profit increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   with gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreasing by to 
the increase in gross profits was attributable to our non acute care segment activities since the acquisition of mts in the second quarter of the decrease in margins were primarily attributable to lower margins associated with our non acute care segment  primarily a reflection of lower margins on the mts product lines 
we expect revenues to increase significantly in due to a full year of contribution from the acquired mts entity 
we do not anticipate any major fluctuations in our gross margins beyond normal fluctuations caused by changes in product mix 
revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected  however  as a result of unforeseen market price reductions and additional costs to expand our business 
net income increased to million in compared to million in due to an increase in gross profit of million  partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses primarily due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and an increase in research and development activities of million 
these increases were primarily driven by the acquisition of mts 
with the acquisition of mts  we have organized our business into two operating business segments acute care  which primarily includes products and services sold to hospital customers  and non acute care  which primarily includes products and services sold to customers outside of hospital settings 
the acute care segment is organized around the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
the non acute care segment includes primarily the manufacturing and selling of consumable medication blister cards  packaging equipment and ancillary products and services  but also includes medication dispensing systems sold to non acute care pharmacies and facilities 
we report segment information based on the management approach 
the management approach designates the internal reporting used by the chief operating decision maker the codm  for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our operating segments 
the codm is our chief executive officer 
the codm allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment  using information about its revenues  gross profit and income loss from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  
table of contents the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we earn revenues from sales of our medication control systems  together with related consumables and services  and medical surgical supply control systems with related services  which are sold in our principal market  which is the healthcare industry 
revenues related to consumable products are reported net of discounts provided to our customers 
our customer arrangements typically include one or more of the following deliverables products software enabled equipment that manages and regulates the storage and dispensing of pharmaceuticals  consumable blister cards and packaging equipment and other medical supplies 
software additional software applications that enable incremental functionality of our equipment 
installation installation of equipment as integrated systems at customers sites 
post installation technical support phone support  on site service  parts and access to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements  if and when available 
professional services other customer services  such as training and consulting 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
equipment and embedded software product delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter  providing evidence that we have delivered what a customer ordered 
in instances of a customer self installation  product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter 
if a sale does not require installation  we recognize revenue on delivery of products to the customer  including transfer of title and risk of loss  assuming all other revenue criteria are met 
we recognize revenue from sales of products to distributors upon delivery  assuming all other revenue criteria are met since we do not allow for rights of return or refund 
for the sale of consumable blister cards  we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss of the products shipped have transferred to the customer  which usually occurs upon shipment from our facilities 
assuming all other revenue criteria are met  we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment assuming all other revenue criteria are met 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  assuming all other revenue criteria are met  we recognize revenue for individual delivered items if they have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
effective for new or modified arrangements entered into beginning on january   the date we adopted the revised revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables on a prospective basis  we allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
this method requires us to determine the selling price at which each deliverable could be sold if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
when available  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value as the selling price 
vsoe represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately  or for a deliverable not yet being sold separately  the price established by management with the relevant authority 
we consider vsoe to exist when approximately or more of our standalone sales of an item are priced within a reasonably narrow pricing range plus or minus of the median rates 
we have established vsoe of fair value for our post installation technical support services and professional services 
when vsoe of fair value is not available  third party evidence tpe of 
table of contents fair value for similar products and services is acceptable  however  our offerings and market strategy differ from those of our competitors  such that we cannot obtain sufficient comparable information about third parties prices 
if neither vsoe nor tpe are available  we use our best estimates of selling prices besp 
we determine besp considering factors such as market conditions  sales channels  internal costs and product margin objectives and pricing practices 
we regularly review and update our vsoe and besp information and obtain formal approval by appropriate levels of management 
the relative selling price method allocates total arrangement consideration proportionally to each deliverable an element on the basis of its estimated selling price 
in addition  the amount recognized for any delivered elements cannot exceed that which is not contingent upon delivery of any remaining elements in the arrangement 
we also use the residual method of allocating the arrangement consideration in certain circumstances 
we use the residual method to allocate total arrangement consideration between delivered and undelivered items for any arrangements entered into prior to january  and not subsequently materially modified 
the use of the residual method is required by software revenue recognition rules that applied to sales of most of our products and services until the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance 
we also use the residual method to allocate revenue between the software products that enable incremental equipment functionality  and thus are not deemed to deliver its essential functionality  and the related post installation technical support  as these products and services continue to be accounted for under software revenue recognition rules 
under the residual method  the amount allocated to the undelivered elements equals vsoe of fair value of these elements 
any remaining amounts are attributed to the delivered items and are recognized when those items are delivered 
a portion of our sales are made through multi year lease agreements 
under sales type leases  we recognize revenue for our hardware and software products net of lease execution costs such as post installation product maintenance and technical support  at the net present value of the lease payment stream once our installation obligations have been met 
we optimize cash flows by selling a majority of our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis 
we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease has been sold 
some of our sales type leases  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house 
interest income on these leases is recognized as a component of product revenue using the interest method 
accounts receivable and notes receivable net investment in sales type leases 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we typically sell our products to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates that customer financial position and ability to pay 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer impaired ability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
uncollectible amounts are charged off against trade receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts when we make a final determination that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated amounts could differ materially from what will actually be uncollectible in the future 
the retained in house leases discussed above are considered financing receivables 
our credit policies and evaluation of credit risk and write off policies are applied alike to trade receivables and the net investment in sales type leases 
for both  an account is generally past due after thirty days 
the financing receivables also have customer specific reserves for accounts identified for specific impairment and a non specific reserve applied to the remaining population  based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
the retained in house leases are not stratified by portfolio or class 
financing receivables which are reserved are generally transferred to cash basis accounting so that revenue is recognized only as cash is received 
however  the cash basis accounts continue to accrue interest 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
for the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangibles resulting from acquisitions  we use the guidance in asc  business combinations 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are not subject to amortization 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
under the provisions of asc  goodwill and other  the recorded goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
in addition  the provisions of asc  require that an entity assign its recorded goodwill to each of its reporting units and test each reporting unit goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier in circumstances whereby certain events might trigger a decrease in the carrying value of goodwill 
we complete our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the first day of our fourth quarter 
in 
table of contents accordance with asc  we have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  or bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the goodwill impairment test 
we have elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
for both our reporting units  the acute care and non acute care segments  we considered the following qualitative factors when assessing if goodwill had been impaired for the year ended december  macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which we operate  an increased competitive environment  a decline in market dependent multiples or metrics consider in both absolute terms and relative to peers  a change in the market for our products or services  or a regulatory or political development  cost factors such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  other relevant entity specific events such as changes in management  key personnel  strategy  or customers  contemplation of bankruptcy or litigation  and events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all  or a portion  of a reporting unit  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
upon completion of our qualitative assessment conducted in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not the fair values of both the acute care and non acute care segments exceeded their carrying values including the respective amounts of goodwill 
in addition  we did not note any other indicators of goodwill impairment as of december  we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain purchased intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset carrying amount 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
significant management judgment is also required for initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangibles assets resulting from business combinations pursuant asc  business combinations 
management must assess the extent to which identified other intangibles assets are properly includable and with the appropriate fair value or properly excludable  by applying the recognition criteria 
this judgment affects not only the other intangible assets but the remainder calculation of goodwill 
the assessment of useful life for each acquired intangible asset impacts future financial position and operating performance through amortization expense 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  applying the first in  first out method  or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence  excess or unmarketable quantities equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about 
table of contents future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility  which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises  including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over their vesting period or requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc accounting for income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with gaap  the provision for income taxes is computed using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in the event that these tax rates change  we will incur a benefit or detriment with respect to our income tax expense in the period of change 
if we were to determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  we will record a valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
recently adopted accounting standards in may  fasb issued asu  fair value measurement  amending the fair value guidance in asc  and thereby achieving substantially converged fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the new guidance clarified some fair value measurement principles and expanded certain disclosure requirements 
we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of  without any impact to our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in july  fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which amends the guidance in asc on impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 
this guidance gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired 
an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to calculating the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of  earlier than required  without any significant impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows  as this update does not change how we calculate impairment loss 
recently issued accounting standards in february  fasb issued  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  which aims to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of aoci 
this update requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we intend to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of we do not anticipate this update will have any significant impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows

table of contents ability to meet customer needs and provide a quality installation experience and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis 
the timing of our acute care product revenues is primarily dependent on when our customers schedules allow for installations 
the overall increase in product revenues was driven by the increased installations of our new automation products  including customer product upgrades using our g platform and revenue derived from mts subsequent to its acquisition by omnicell during the second quarter of we anticipate that our revenues will continue to increase in as we fulfill our existing backlog of orders and as we experience higher customer product upgrades to the g platform in addition to having a full year of non acute care revenues from the acquisition of mts 
cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to this increase was primarily a result of non acute care product costs of million  which included million of acquisition related charges primarily associated with the step up to the estimated fair value of inventory acquired from mts and consumed in the normal manufacturing cycle of our business 
the increase in acute care product revenue and change in product mix resulted in an increase of million in costs 
gross profit on product revenue increased by million  or  in as compared to and gross profit as a percentage of product revenues decreased to in as compared to in the increase in gross profit on product revenue was primarily a result of the contribution from our non acute care segment described above  as well as increased gross profits in our acute care segment  which was driven primarily by product mix 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenue was due to the lower non acute care segment gross profit as a percent of revenue  which drove the overall gross profit as a percentage of revenue down

compared to product revenues increased million  or  in as compared to the overall increase in product revenues was driven by a combination of increased installations of our new automation products  increases in lease renewals from existing customers and a full year of revenues derived from our acquisition of pandora at the end of the third quarter of cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily a function of revenue growth  partially offset by the favorable impact of overall product mix and generally lower material costs from our cost reduction efforts during the year 
additionally  during the year we incurred higher product costs related to the manufacturing cost of the new g cabinet console platform  released in may the early production units of the g cabinet console were at a higher product cost than our previous generation product 
this was due to initial production line ramp up and longer production cycles to validate the manufacturability and quality of the new console

cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to these increases were primarily a result of the aforementioned addition of our non acute care segment of million  offset by a million decrease in the acute care segment service costs due to lower costs incurred related to advance replacement of material covered under maintenance contracts 
gross profit on service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to this increase was due to increased revenues from an expanded installed base attributable to our acute care segment with nominal growth in service costs as a result of service cost reduction efforts throughout we expect our service and other revenues and the associated gross profit to continue to increase in with the continued expansion of our installed base of automation systems and service and maintenance contracts 
compared to service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase in service and other revenues was primarily the result of an expansion in our installed base of automation systems and a resulting increase in the number of support service contracts 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in spending related to salaries and benefits associated with higher headcount and spare parts expense in support of the expanded service base

the overall increase in research and development expenses reflects an increase of million attributable to the non acute care segment since the acquisition of mts in the second quarter of  partially offset by an overall decrease of million attributable to the acute care segment 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue to invest in new products and services  but stay relatively flat as a percentage of revenues
