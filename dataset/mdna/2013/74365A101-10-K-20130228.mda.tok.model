item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis  particularly with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our proprietary procellex protein expression system 
using our procellex system  we are developing a pipeline of proprietary and biosimilar versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our plant cell based expression technology that target large  established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action 
our initial commercial focus has been on complex therapeutic proteins  including proteins for the treatment of genetic disorders  such as gaucher disease and fabry disease 
we believe procellex will enable us to develop proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically equivalent or superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications 
because we are primarily targeting biologically equivalent versions of highly active  well tolerated and commercially successful therapeutic proteins  we believe our development process is associated with relatively less risk compared to other biopharmaceutical development processes for completely novel therapeutic proteins 
on may   the fda approved our first commercial product  elelyso  as an ert for the long term treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type gaucher disease 
the israeli moh approved taliglucerase alfa in september and it also approved for sale in uruguay 
taliglucerase alfa is a proprietary  recombinant form of glucocerebrosidase gcd that is expressed or produced through procellex 
taliglucerase alfa is the first plant cell based recombinant therapeutic protein to be approved by each of the fda and the israeli moh 
gaucher disease is a rare and serious lysosomal storage disorder with severe and debilitating symptoms 
gaucher patients suffer from mutations in or deficiencies of gcd  an enzyme that is naturally found in human cells 
since may  taliglucerase alfa has been marketed in the united states by pfizer  our commercialization partner  as provided in the exclusive license and supply agreement by and between protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary  and pfizer  which we refer to as the pfizer agreement 
we granted pfizer an exclusive  worldwide license to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa under the pfizer agreement  but retained those rights in israel 
we have agreed to a specific allocation between protalix ltd 
and pfizer of the responsibilities for the continued development efforts for taliglucerase alfa outside of israel 
our share in the collaboration with pfizer for was a loss of approximately  we are cooperating with pfizer to obtain marketing approval for taliglucerase alfa in additional countries and jurisdictions 
currently  marketing authorization applications have been filed with anvisa as well as in other countries 
in november  we announced that the european commission issued a commission decision refusing the marketing authorization for taliglucerase alfa in the european union 
this decision is an endorsement of the chmp s june opinion recommending against the marketing authorization of taliglucerase alfa 
while the chmp gave a positive risk benefit assessment for taliglucerase alfa  its recommendation was based solely on the orphan market exclusivity granted to vpriv  shire gaucher disease treatment 
it was not based on the safety and efficacy profile of taliglucerase alfa 
in december  we entered into a clinical development agreement with pfizer under which we will continue to manage  administer and sponsor current  ongoing clinical trials relating to elelyso 
we are currently sponsoring adult and pediatric extension studies of elelyso 
new clinical trials for elelyso will be conducted and sponsored by pfizer 
under the terms of the agreement  we were eligible to receive a milestone payment of million upon the achievement of certain near term clinical development milestones 
the milestones were achieved prior to the end of fiscal year and have been paid in full 
the million milestone payment we received in connection with certain clinical development milestones will be recognized as a deduction from the relevant expenses we incur during the relevant periods 
this agreement helps to maintain the continuity of the ongoing clinical trials for gaucher patients and physicians and reinforces the companies mutual commitment to the gaucher community 
we performed a number of studies on taliglucerase alfa to supplement the pivotal phase iii clinical trial which we completed in september we initiated a double blind  follow on extension study in which consisted of eligible patients who had completed nine months of treatment in the pivotal phase iii clinical trial 
the patients were offered the opportunity to continue to receive taliglucerase alfa at the same dose they received in the pivotal trial for an additional months in a blinded manner 
we also conducted a nine month  worldwide  multi center  open label  switch over clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching gaucher patients currently treated with cerezyme  which is produced by genzyme  with taliglucerase alfa which was successfully completed in we also conducted a clinical trial of na ve and switchover pediatric patients which we concluded in patients in the extension trial and the switchover trial are still being treated with taliglucerase alfa 
currently  patients are being treated with elelyso on a commercial basis in the united states and in israel shortly 
globally  patients are being treated through our extension trials and related studies  compassionate use programs  special access agreements  named patient provisions and other programs designed to ensure that treatments are available to gaucher patients in light of recent shortages of approved treatments 
in france  gaucher patients are being treated with taliglucerase alfa through an atu 
in addition to the united states and france  taliglucerase alfa is currently being provided to gaucher patients under special access agreements or named patient provisions in brazil and in other countries 
hundreds of patients  in the aggregate  have been treated with taliglucerase alfa 
on august   pfizer entered into a million short term supply agreement with the brazilian moh pursuant to which protalix and pfizer have provided taliglucerase alfa to the brazilian moh for the treatment of gaucher patients 
during the remainder of and the first quarter of  we and pfizer completed the supply of products deliverable under the short term supply agreement 
during  the brazilian moh requested that pfizer consider the replacement of certain vials that might expire during during the third quarter of  we and pfizer resupplied a portion of the returned vials 
in addition  we and the brazilian moh are in discussions relating to a possible long term supply agreement that contemplates  among other matters  providing certain components of our manufacturing technology to the brazilian moh for implementation by it in brazil 
we are currently unable to assess whether these discussions will result in an agreement and we can make no assurance that we will be able to enter into such an agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
in any event  we do not expect to supply the brazilian moh taliglucerase alfa until anvisa grants marketing approval to taliglucerase alfa  if at all 
in addition to taliglucerase alfa  we are developing an innovative product pipeline using our procellex protein expression system 
our product pipeline currently includes  among other candidates prx  a therapeutic protein candidate for the treatment of fabry disease  a rare  genetic lysosomal disorder in humans  prx  a plant cell expressed pegylated recombinant acetylcholinesterase product candidate for biodefense and other indications  an orally administered glucocerebrosidase enzyme for the treatment of gaucher patients utilizing oral delivery of the recombinant enzyme produced within carrot cells  prx  or pr antitnf  a plant cell expressed recombinant fusion protein made from the soluble form of the human tnf receptor tnfr and an antibody portion  which is being developed as a treatment of certain immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  chrohn disease  placque psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders  and two additional undisclosed therapeutic proteins  both of which are being evaluated in animal studies 
we participated in a pre investigational new drug  or ind  meeting with respect to one of the undisclosed product candidates in the first quarter of and a pre ind meeting for the second candidate is planned for in march  we initiated a preliminary phase i clinical trial of prx which we completed in june in our preclinical studies we utilized an analogue to nerve gas 
however  we anticipate that we will use live nerve gas rather than an analogue in the proposed additional efficacy trials in animals 
in december  the first patient was treated in our phase i ii clinical study of prx in fabry patients 
we anticipate commencing a clinical trial in gaucher patients designed to demonstrate safety and achieve the first ever proof in concept regarding orally administrated glucocerebrosidase enzyme during the first half of in december  we held a pre ind meeting with respect to prx and we expect to submit an ind during except for the rights to commercialize taliglucerase alfa worldwide other than israel which we licensed to pfizer  we hold the worldwide commercialization rights to our proprietary development candidates 
we have built an internal marketing team designed to serve the israeli market for taliglucerase alfa and we intend to establish internal commercialization and marketing teams for our other product candidates in north america  the european union and in other significant markets  including israel  subject to required marketing approvals  as the need arises 
in addition  we continuously evaluate potential strategic marketing partnerships 
our business is conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  protalix ltd  which we acquired through a reverse merger transaction effective december  the merger transaction was treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes and  as such  the results of operations discussed below are those of protalix ltd 
prior to the merger transaction  we had not conducted any operations for several years 
protalix ltd 
was originally incorporated in israel in december and  since inception  it has generated significant losses in connection with its research and development  including the clinical development of taliglucerase alfa 
we expect that our expenditures in connection with the research and development activities will continue to represent a significant portion of our expenses for the next several years  and will require further financial resources if the activities are successful 
we believe that if taliglucerase alfa is launched successfully  it will generate revenues to offset any such expenses 
we may need to obtain additional funds for the commercialization of taliglucerase alfa and to further develop the research and clinical development of our other programs 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
functional currency the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the us dollar 
most of the company s revenues are derived in dollars 
in addition  most of the company s expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and the major source of the company s financing has been provided in dollars 
revenues currently  our sole source of revenues comes from sales of taliglucerase alfa pursuant to our license agreement with pfizer  our sales of taliglucerase alfa in israel and from milestone payments under the pfizer agreement 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  which is when revenue is realized or realizable and earned  there is persuasive evidence a revenue arrangement exists  delivery of goods or services has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received pursuant to the pfizer agreement in accordance with guidance regarding revenue recognition and accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
pursuant to this guidance  we determine whether our arrangement with pfizer involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting or separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if we determine that there are multiple units of accounting  the consideration from the arrangement is allocated among the separate units based on a relative fair value allocation 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue is recognized over the performance obligation period 
as the arrangement with pfizer requires our continued involvement with respect to the proposed commercialization of taliglucerase alfa  the non refundable  up front license payments we received from pfizer are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimated the performance period of years based on the date that the last relevant patent relating to taliglucerase alfa expires 
the million milestone payment received in connection with the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa in the united states was considered to be a substantive milestone for purposes of revenue recognition  and  accordingly  was recorded as revenue during the period in which the milestone was achieved 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we are entitled to of the net profits or loss from sales of taliglucerase alfa by pfizer and reimbursement of our certain related expenses we incur in connection with pfizer sales other than those related to sales in israel 
we retained all rights to taliglucerase alfa in israel 
we recognize our share of net profit or loss under the pfizer agreement based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms of the pfizer agreement  for its subsidiaries operating outside the united states  financial information is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december we recognize revenues received from the sale of a product to pfizer upon delivery to pfizer 
the revenues represent our cost with respect to the product sold 
research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to third party contract research organizations  investigative clinical sites and consultants  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the advancement of product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the following table identifies our current major research and development projects project status expected near term milestones prx alpha gal a phase i ii clinical trial complete enrollment oral glucocerebrosidase preclinical stage research performed initiate phase i clinical trial acetylcholinesterase phase i clinical trial additional phase i clinical trials pr antitnf research complete pre clinical development  file ind and initiate phase i clinical trials we anticipate incurring increasing costs in connection with our alpha galactosidase and oral treatment of gaucher disease projects 
in addition  we continue to incur costs in connection with our extension studies of taliglucerase alfa  although such costs are offset by the million payment we received in connection with our clinical development agreement with pfizer 
our other projects are in the early clinical  preclinical or research phases with relatively immaterial costs 
to date  most of our research and development costs were incurred in connection with our phase iii clinical trial of taliglucerase alfa 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across all of our projects 
we currently do not record and maintain research and development costs per project 
the costs and expenses of our projects are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
each grant is deducted from the related research and development expenses as the costs are incurred 
for additional information regarding the grant process  see business israeli government programs encouragement of industrial research and development law  in item of this annual report 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of the product candidates in our pipeline for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
see risk factors if we are unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates  our business will be adversely affected and we may not obtain the necessary us  ema or other worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in a timely manner  if at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and preclinical product development programs for our product candidates other than taliglucerase alfa 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
taliglucerase alfa has been approved for sale in the united states  israel and uruguay  and marketing authorization applications are outstanding for brazil and other countries 
due to the factors set forth above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
see risk factors clinical trials are very expensive  time consuming and difficult to design and implement and may result in unforeseen costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
share based compensation the discussion below regarding share based compensation relates to share based compensation paid by protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
in accordance with the guidance  we record the benefit of any grant to a non employee and remeasure the benefit in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants  as applicable 
in addition  we use the straight line accounting method for recording the benefit of the entire grant  unlike the graded method we use to record grants made to employees 
we measure share based compensation cost for all share based awards at the fair value on the grant date and recognition of share based compensation over the service period for awards that we expect will vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined based on the number of shares granted and the price of our ordinary shares  and calculated based on the black scholes valuation model 
we recognize such value as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the restricted shares of common stock granted to employees during the fiscal year ended december   our management used the fair value of our common stock which was the closing sale price of our common stock on the nyse mkt on the date of grant 
the guidance requires companies to estimate the expected term of the option rather than simply using the contractual term of an option 
because of lack of data on past option exercises by employees  the expected term of the options could not be based on historic exercise patterns 
accordingly  we adopted the simplified method  according to which companies may calculate the expected term as the average between the vesting date and the expiration date  assuming the option was granted as a plain vanilla option 
in performing the valuation  we assumed an expected dividend yield in the previous years and in the next years 
we do not have a dividend policy and given the lack of profitability  dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
the guidance stipulates a number of factors that should be considered when estimating the expected volatility  including the implied volatility of traded options  historical volatility and the period that the shares of the company are being publicly traded 
the risk free interest rate described above has been based on the implied yield of us federal reserve zero coupon government bonds 
the remaining term of the bonds used for each valuation was equal to the expected term of the grant 
this methodology has been applied to all grants valued by us 
the guidance requires the use of a risk free interest rate based on the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed  with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
this requirement has been applied for all grants valued as part of this report 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the million milestone payment we received from pfizer in connection with the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa in the united states 
the increase was also due to the increase in the supply of taliglucerase alfa vials to pfizer during the year ended december  revenues also include the amortization of the million upfront and milestone payments received from pfizer 
the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
our share in the collaboration agreement we recorded a loss of  as our share in the collaboration under the pfizer agreement during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the million of loss recorded for the year ended december  our share in the collaboration loss for the year ended december  represents our share of the net loss generated during the period  which was primarily the result of the expenses incurred during the period mainly in connection with activities related to the us launch of taliglucerase alfa which exceeded the revenues generated by pfizer in the united states  and resupply in brazil 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we record income or loss equal to of the profit or loss realized from sales of taliglucerase alfa and related expenses incurred based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the pfizer agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  financial information of pfizer s subsidiaries that operate outside the united states is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to the cost of revenues of million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for the year ended december  includes approximately million for royalties due to the ocs and a certain academic institution in connection with gross sales of taliglucerase alfa during the period and million for certain fixed costs relating mainly to our manufacturing facility  including rent  depreciation  salary and maintenance expenses  and to a much lesser extent  the direct cost of products delivered to pfizer during the period 
prior to the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa  manufacturing costs related to taliglucerase alfa were not capitalized  rather  such costs were expensed as research and development expenses 
effective as of the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa on may   we capitalize all manufacturing costs associated with taliglucerase alfa 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of million in expenses related to consulting and subcontractors  and a decrease of million in certain expenses  such as rent  depreciation and maintenance  that were classified as cost of revenues or capitalized as inventory after the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa on may  such decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in salaries expense associated with research and development activities mainly due to share based compensation  bonuses paid in connection with the fda s approval of taliglucerase alfa and the initiation of the phase i ii clinical trial of prx for fabry disease 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of preclinical and clinical trials for certain of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in salaries expense primarily due to bonuses paid in connection with the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa on may  and share based compensation 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of  in legal and accounting expenses 
financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the higher average cash balance during the year compared to which earned interest 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increases in the supply of taliglucerase alfa vials to pfizer during the year ended december  revenues also include the amortization of the million upfront and milestone payments received from pfizer 
the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
our share in the collaboration agreement we recorded million of loss as our share in the collaboration under the pfizer agreement during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the million of income recorded for the year ended december  our share in the collaboration loss for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our share of the allowance for sales return of taliglucerase alfa recorded by pfizer in connection with the short term supply agreement between pfizer and the brazilian moh 
during  the brazilian moh requested that pfizer consider the replacement of certain vials that might expire during as a result  pfizer recorded an allowance for sales return 
the allowance was partially offset by our share in the income generated through sale of taliglucerase alfa via the atu program in france 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we record income or loss equal to of the profit or loss realized from sales of taliglucerase alfa and related expenses incurred based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the pfizer agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  financial information of pfizer s subsidiaries that operate outside the united states is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of  from million for the year ended december  the research and development expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by grants received from the ocs of approximately million  and million of reimbursements for certain expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of preclinical and clinical trials for certain of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase  from million for the year ended december  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we become a commercial company 
financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from the devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar and lower interest rates available for short term deposits during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of significant product sales revenue due to the recent launch of taliglucerase alfa in the united states and israel  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since our inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds equal to million from the sale of shares of convertible preferred and ordinary shares of protalix ltd  and an additional million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the sale of such shares  through december  in addition  on october   we generated gross proceeds of million in connection with an underwritten public offering of our common stock and on each of march  and february   we generated gross proceeds of million and million  respectively  in connection with underwritten public offerings of our common stock 
we believe that the funds currently available to us as are sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for at least months 
the following table summarizes our public funding sources since security year number of shares amount common stock   common stock   common stock   in addition to the foregoing  pfizer paid protalix ltd 
million as an upfront payment in connection with the execution of the pfizer agreement and subsequently paid to protalix ltd 
an additional million upon protalix ltd 
s meeting a certain milestone 
protalix ltd 
also received a milestone payment of in connection with the fda approval of taliglucerase alfa in may protalix ltd 
is also entitled to payments equal to of the net profits earned by pfizer on its global sales of taliglucerase alfa except in israel 
in calculating net profits there are certain agreed upon limits on the amounts that may be deducted from gross sales for certain expenses and costs of goods sold 
pfizer has also paid protalix ltd 
million in connection with the successful achievement of certain milestones under the clinical development agreement between pfizer and protalix ltd 
cash flows net cash provided by operations was  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  of million decreased primarily due to million in share based compensation and million in depreciation and a million increase in accounts payable  which was partially offset by a an increase of million in inventory 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting primarily of net proceeds from our february underwritten public offering of common stock 
net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  the net loss for of million was further increased by an increase in deferred revenues of approximately million 
the net loss was partially offset by non cash charges for share based compensation of  depreciation of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was million and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided from financing activities during was approximately million primarily due to our underwritten public offering of common stock in the first quarter of future funding requirements we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures in the near future 
however  we anticipate that we will generate revenues to offset such losses as pfizer commercialization efforts for taliglucerase alfa progress after the fda approval in may  and as we begin to generate revenues from the commercialization of taliglucerase alfa in israel after the israeli moh approval in september we also anticipate that we will generate additional revenues after additional anticipated marketing approvals of taliglucerase alfa are granted outside of the united states and israel  including  primarily  in brazil 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and the advancement of prx and oral glucocerebrosidase and any other product candidates in our pipeline into clinical trials 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will marginally increase as we expand our administrative staff  add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to the continued progression of the commercialization of taliglucerase alfa 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that are subject to change and may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of pfizer commercialization efforts in the united states  the progress of our commercialization efforts in israel and  if anticipated marketing approvals of taliglucerase alfa are granted in other jurisdictions  the progress of pfizer global commercialization efforts  the progress and results of our clinical trials  the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution 
we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we currently do not have any commitments for future external funding 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
effects of inflation and currency fluctuations inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or currency fluctuations could affect us by increased or decreased costs mainly for goods and services acquired outside of israel 
we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and recently issued accounting pronouncements none

since the dollar is the functional currency  monetary items maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and non monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expense items are remeasured at the average rate of exchange in effect during the period in which they occur 
foreign currency translation gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
approximately of our costs  including salaries  expenses and office expenses  are incurred in nis 
inflation in israel may have the effect of increasing the us dollar cost of our operations in israel 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
a revaluation of of the nis will affect our income before tax by less than 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows year ended december  average rate for period rate at year end to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all short term  highly liquid investments  which include short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase  that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  to be cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we invest any cash balances primarily in bank deposits and investment grade interest bearing instruments 
we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
our interest gains may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets
