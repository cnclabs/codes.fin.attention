we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statements 
overview virtualscopics  inc is a leading provider of imaging solutions to accelerate drug and medical device development 
we have developed a robust software platform for analysis and modeling of both structural and functional medical images 
in combination with our industry leading experience and expertise in advanced imaging biomarker measurement  this platform provides a uniquely clear window into the biological activity of drugs and devices in clinical trial patients  allowing our customers to make better decisions faster 
since inception  revenues have been derived primarily from image processing services in connection with pharmaceutical drug trials 
for these services  we have been concentrating in the areas of oncology and osteoarthritis 
we have also derived a small portion of revenue from consulting services  and pharmaceutical drug trials in the neurology and cardiovascular areas 
we expect that the concentration of our revenue will continue in these services and in those areas in revenues are recognized as the medical images that we process are quantified and delivered to our customers and or the services are performed 
beginning in  we began to pursue the personalized medicine market  however  we do not anticipate significant revenues from this market opportunity in as we are in the early stages of commercialization including our strategy relative to regulatory approval and validation of our software 
as of december   the amount remaining to be earned from active projects and awards was approximately million 
the reduction in backlog when compared to prior year is due to the generation of revenue from the backlog  softness in new project awards in and the ordinary close out of projects with balances remaining 
once we enter into a new contract for participation in a drug trial  there are several factors that can effect whether we will realize the full benefits under the contract  and the time over which we will realize that revenue 
customers may not continue our services due to performance reasons with their compounds in development 
furthermore  the contracts may contemplate performance over multiple years 
therefore  revenue may not be realized in the fiscal year in which the contract is signed or the award is made 
recognition of revenue under the contract may also be affected by the timing of patient recruitment and image site identification and training 
additionally  the majority of contracts we have with customers are cancelable for any reason by giving days advance notice 
results of operations results of operations for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues we had revenues of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   representing a decrease 
the decrease in revenues is related to a slowdown in the amount of new projects awarded in and delays in decisions being made by new and reoccurring customers on outstanding proposals as well as delays in the initiation of previously awarded and contracted projects 
in july of we hired two individuals to augment our sales efforts in europe and the us west coast  two areas which we believed had been underserviced in the past 
we believe these individuals will help enable us to better attack the market and provide us greater visibility in those regions 
in addition to hiring sales representatives  we have reorganized our sales function which will allow our sales personnel more time to pursue opportunities and interface with existing and prospective customers 
although the amount of new project awards has been slower than we experienced in previous years  we did see an increased number of requests for proposals in  in particular through the ppd channel 
we believe that this increase in requests for proposals and our strategic alliance with ppd  inc will help increase the level of business activity from what we have experienced in and as of december   we had active projects with of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the world 
gross profit we had a gross profit of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in the gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  our margins declined year over year primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues encountered during as discussed above

this compares to   and  respectively  for research and development research and development costs increased in by  or  to  when compared to the increase was due to hiring within our software development group and consultant and professional fees in support of our personalized medicine initiative  along with our efforts to secure our first k with the fda 
our research and development efforts within our core business center around refining our processes through the use of our software platform in order to gain efficiencies which we believe will better allow us to standardize our processes and improve our gross margin 
additionally  we continue to invest in the commercialization of new imaging techniques across various imaging modalities and therapeutic areas 
as of december  and  there were and employees in our research and development group  respectively  which includes the algorithm and software development groups 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs increased in by  or  to  when compared to the increase was the result of hiring two experienced sales individuals to cover the european and west coast us territories in the third quarter of our sales and marketing efforts include conference attendance and presentations  technically focused webinars  customer webinars and related travel along with advertising in key scientific journals 
during  we made further investments in driving awareness of our strategic alliance with ppd and the benefits it provides the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
the ppd alliance was expanded in january to include cardiovascular  central nervous system and medical device studies 
as december  and  there were and individuals in our sales and marketing department  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  representing a decrease of  or  when compared to the decrease was driven by a reduction in non cash stock compensation costs and general cost controls within our core business offset by hiring within our quality control group and consultant fees in support of our personalized medicine initiative 
general and administrative expenses include both personnel and non personnel costs 
departments included within general and administrative function are finance  information technology  quality  human resources and the ceo position 
non payroll related costs included within general and administration include stock option expense  audit and legal fees  regulatory and compliance fees  nasdaq listing fees  board fees  non capitalizable hardware and software costs and licenses and non sales related travel costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization charges decreased for the year ended december  by  or  to  when compared to the reduction is due to the complete amortization of our right to use an mri unit at the university of rochester a related party during offsetting this reduction was higher depreciation charges related to recent capital purchases  including the purchase and installation cost of an erp system in the amortization and depreciation costs are based on the timing and life of patents and property and equipment 
we continue to invest in our patent portfolio  however  we do not anticipate significant expenditures are necessary to support our current business and future strategies 
our it systems are the basis of our operating platform  therefore  we will continue to invest in our it infrastructure to ensure we have a robust and reliable operating system 
other income expense  net interest income for the year ended december  was  representing interest derived on the company s operating and savings accounts  compared to interest income of  in the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates earned on the account balances in other expense for the years ended december  and remained relatively consistent  decreasing to  from  additionally  we recognized an unrealized loss of  related to the fair value of certain warrants that were issued in connection with our series b offering see financial statement note 
during  we recognized an unrealized gain of  related to the fair value of those warrants 
the aggregate decrease of  when compared to is attributable to the higher average price of our common stock prior to closing the series c financing in april and the decrease in the number of derivative instruments outstanding due to the elimination of the anti dilution adjustment provision in certain series b warrants as part of the series c financing 
as of december   the company had  warrants outstanding subject to the anti dilution adjustment provision as compared to the  at december  net income loss our net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  the decrease in our net income over the prior period was attributable to lower revenues and gross profit in addition to the non cash unrealized loss on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital was primarily a result of the financing agreement we entered into during with merck ghi that resulted in the receipt of net proceeds of approximately  additionally  there was cash provided by operating activities of  in as compared to  in due to the timing differences of non cash expenses and the receipt of accounts receivables during the years 
we invested  in the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of patents in  compared to  for the investment in these items in the decrease represents prior year investments in our it and is infrastructure and the costs associated with the acquisition of a new it storage system to support our services that did not reoccur in we anticipate that our it related costs will increase in as we continue to invest in our operating system and infrastructure in connection with our personalized medicine initiative and support of our core business 
during we incurred  in patent costs associated with filing costs for intellectual property  as compared to  in the increase is due to the timing of office actions within our existing patent filings 
net cash provided in financing activities was  and  in and  respectively 
the increase is a result of proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants and the closing of the financing with merck ghi during the terms of the merck ghi financing provide for a second closing of series c preferred stock  if  among other things  we meet certain milestones toward the development of a quantitative imaging center on or before april  we do not expect that this second closing will occur  however  we intend to continue to pursue our efforts in support of obtaining fda acceptance 
we currently expect that existing cash will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for the next months and foreseeable future 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to continue our efforts to commercialize our personalized medicine solutions in the short term  our capital requirements will depend on the feedback we receive from the fda and insurance providers payers 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital available to successfully commercialize our personalized medicine applications 
if in the future our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
if we need to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise sufficient funds on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail our level of expenditures and our rate of expansion 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases as described in contractual obligations below that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures
