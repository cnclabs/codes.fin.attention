item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with state regulations  pge s retail customer prices are determined through general rate case proceedings and various tariffs filed with the opuc from time to time  and are based on the company s cost of service 
additionally  the company offers different pricing options that include a daily market price option  renewable energy options  which are offered to residential and small commercial customers  and time of use options 
for additional information on customer options  see retail customer choice program within the regulation and rates section of this item additional information on the customer classes follows 
residential customers include single family housing  multiple family housing such as apartments  duplexes  and town homes  mobile homes  and small farms 
residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather  with demand historically highest during the winter heating season 
due to the increased use of air conditioning in pge s service territory  the summer peaks have increased in recent years 
economic conditions can also affect demand from the company s residential customers  as historical data suggests that high unemployment rates contribute to a decrease in demand 
residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  however  the company s decoupling mechanism is intended to mitigate the financial effects of such measures 
while the number of residential customers increased during  total residential deliveries decreased compared to driven by warmer weather conditions during the heating season in during  as a result of cooler weather during the heating season and an increase in the average number of customers  total residential deliveries increased compared to commercial customers consist of non residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers 
this customer class consists of most businesses  including small industrial companies  and public street and highway lighting accounts 
demand from the company s commercial customers is somewhat less susceptible to weather conditions than the residential class  although weather does have an effect on commercial demand 
economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to corresponding changes in energy demand from commercial customers 
commercial demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  the financial effects of which are partially mitigated by the company s decoupling mechanism 
in  the unfavorable weather effects compared with nearly offset the addition of an average of over new customers  contributing to the decrease in deliveries to commercial customers compared with  while oregon non farm employment increased 
in  the favorable weather effects combined with the addition of an average of nearly new customers contributed to the increase in deliveries to commercial customers compared with  as oregon non farm employment increased 
industrial customers consist of non residential customers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers  with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered and the applicable tariff 
demand from industrial customers is primarily driven by economic conditions  with weather having little impact on this customer class 
a change in economic activity can lead to a change in energy demand from the company s industrial customers 
in  the company s industrial energy deliveries increased compared to  driven primarily by expansion in the high tech sector 
in  industrial deliveries rose compared to as demand increased from certain paper production customers  and the general economic conditions improved 
other accrued revenues  net include items that are not currently in customer prices  but are expected to be in prices in a future period 
such amounts include deferrals recorded under the rac  the pcam  and the decoupling mechanism

table of contents wholesale revenues pge participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers 
interconnected transmission systems in the western united states serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power  hydro conditions  and daily and seasonal retail demand 
wholesale revenues represented of total revenues in each of and the majority of pge s wholesale electricity sales is to utilities and power marketers and is predominantly short term 
the company may net purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power  with only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations physically settled 
other operating revenues other operating revenues consist primarily of gains and losses on the sale of excess natural gas  as well as revenues from transmission services  excess transmission capacity resales  excess fuel oil sales  pole contact rentals  and other electric services provided to customers 
other operating revenues represented of total revenues in each of and seasonality demand for electricity by pge s residential and  to a lesser extent  commercial customers is affected by seasonal weather conditions  as discussed above 
the company uses heating and cooling degree days to determine the effect of weather on the demand for electricity 
heating and cooling degree days provide cumulative variances in the average daily temperature from a baseline of degrees  over a period of time  to indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use  or have used  electricity for heating or air conditioning 
the higher the number of degree days  the greater the expected demand for heating or cooling 
the following table indicates the heating and cooling degree days for the most recent three year period  along with year averages for the most recent year provided by the national weather service  as measured at portland international airport heating degree days cooling degree days year average for 
table of contents pge s all time high net system load peak of  megawatts mw occurred in december the company s all time summer peak of  mw occurred in july the following tables present the company s average winter and summer loads for the periods indicated along with the corresponding peak load and month in which it occurred winter loads mw average peak month january january november summer loads mw average peak month august september august the company tracks and evaluates both load growth and peak load requirements for purposes of long term load forecasting and integrated resource planning as well as for preparing general rate case assumptions 
behavior patterns  conservation  energy efficiency initiatives and measures  weather effects  economic conditions  and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate capacity reserves 

table of contents power supply pge relies upon its generating resources as well as short and long term power and fuel purchase contracts to meet its customers energy requirements 
the company executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation  and participates in the wholesale market as a result of those economic dispatch decisions  in an effort to obtain reasonably priced power for its retail customers  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts 
the company also promotes energy efficiency measures to meet its energy requirements 
pge s generating resources consist of five thermal plants natural gas and coal fired turbines  seven hydroelectric plants  and a wind farm located at biglow canyon in eastern oregon 
the volume of electricity the company generates is dependent upon  among other factors  the capacity and availability of its generating resources 
capacity of the thermal plants represents the mw the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions  net of electricity used in the operation of the plant 
the capacity of the company s thermal generating resources is also affected by ambient temperatures 
capacity of both hydro and wind generating resources represent the nameplate mw  which varies from actual energy expected to be received as these types of generating resources are highly dependent upon river flows and wind conditions  respectively 
availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations  which reflects the impact of planned and forced outages 
for a complete listing of these facilities  see generating facilities in item properties 
pge s resource capacity in mw was as follows as of december  capacity capacity capacity generation thermal natural gas coal total thermal hydro wind total generation purchased power long term contracts capacity exchange hydro wind solar other total long term contracts short term contracts total purchased power total resource capacity capacity represents nameplate and differs from expected energy to be generated  which is expected to range from mwa to mwa  dependent upon river flows 
capacity represents nameplate and differs from expected energy to be generated  which is expected to range from mwa to mwa  dependent upon wind conditions 

table of contents for information regarding actual generating output and purchases for the years ended december   and  see the results of operations section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
generation the portion of pge s retail load requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors  including planned and forced outages  availability and price of coal and natural gas  precipitation and snow pack levels  the market price of electricity  and wind variability 
thermal pge has a ownership interest in boardman  which it operates  and a ownership interest in colstrip units and colstrip  which is operated by a third party 
these two coal fired generating facilities provided approximately of the company s total retail load requirement in  compared with in and in the company s three natural gas fired generating facilities  port westward  beaver  and coyote springs  provided approximately of its total retail load requirement in  compared with in and in the thermal plants provide reliable power for the company s customers and capacity reserves 
these resources have a combined capacity of  mw  representing approximately of the net capacity of pge s generating facilities 
thermal plant availability  excluding colstrip  was in  compared with in and in  while colstrip plant availability was in  compared with in and in hydro the company s ferc licensed hydroelectric projects consist of pelton round butte on the deschutes river near madras  oregon discussed below  four plants on the clackamas river  and one on the willamette river 
the licenses for these projects expire at various dates ranging from to although these plants have a combined capacity of mw  actual energy received is dependent upon river flows 
energy from these resources provided of the company s total retail load requirement in   and  with availability of in  compared with in and in northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region s power supply  with water conditions significantly impacting pge s cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases 
pge has a ownership interest in the mw pelton round butte hydroelectric project on the deschutes river  with the remaining interest held by the confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation of oregon tribes 
a year joint license for the project  which is operated by pge  was issued by the ferc in the tribes have an option to purchase an additional undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion on or after december  the tribes have a second option to purchase an undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion on or after april  if both options are exercised by the tribes  the tribes ownership percentage would exceed 
wind biglow canyon wind farm biglow canyon  located in sherman county  oregon  is pge s largest renewable energy resource with wind turbines with a total nameplate capacity of approximately mw 
it was completed and placed in service in three phases between december and august the energy from biglow canyon provided of the company s total retail load requirement in both and  and in availability for biglow canyon was in  compared with in and in the expected energy from wind resources differs from the nameplate capacity and is expected to range from mwa to mwa for biglow canyon  dependent upon wind conditions 
dispatchable standby generation dsg pge has a dsg program under which the company can start  operate  and monitor customer owned standby generators when needed to meet peak demand 
the program helps provide operating reserves for the company s generating resources and  when operating  can supply most or all of dsg customer loads 
as of december   there were projects that together can provide approximately mw 
table of contents of diesel fired capacity at peak times 
in addition  there were projects under construction that are expected to provide an additional mw 
fuel supply pge contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the company s thermal generating plants  with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil if needed 
in addition  the company uses forward  swap  and option contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
coal boardman pge has fixed price purchase agreements that provide coal for boardman into the coal is obtained from surface mining operations in wyoming and montana and is delivered by rail under two separate ten year transportation contracts which extend through pge expects to begin seeking requests for proposal in for the purchase of coal to fill open positions for and beyond 
the terms of any contracts and quality of coal are expected to be staged in alignment with the timing of the installation of required emissions controls 
for additional information on boardman s emissions controls  see capital requirements in the liquidity and capital resources section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of coal are available to meet anticipated operations of boardman for the foreseeable future 
natural gas port westward and beaver pge manages the price risk of natural gas supply for port westward through financial contracts up to months in advance 
physical supplies for port westward and beaver are generally purchased within months of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plants 
pge owns  and is the operator of record  of the kelso beaver pipeline  which directly connects both generating plants to the northwest pipeline  an interstate natural gas pipeline operating between british columbia and new mexico 
currently  pge transports gas on the kelso beaver pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement  with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the company 
pge has access to  dth per day of firm gas transportation capacity to serve the two plants 
pge also has contractual access through april to natural gas storage in mist  oregon  from which it can draw in the event that gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use 
this storage may be used to fuel both port westward and beaver 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available to meet anticipated operations of both plants for the foreseeable future 
the beaver generating plant has the capability to operate on no 
diesel fuel oil when it is economical or if the plant s natural gas supply is interrupted 
pge had an approximate day supply of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel oil at the plant site as of december  the current operating permit for beaver limits the number of gallons of fuel oil that can be burned daily  which effectively limits the daily hours of operation of beaver on fuel oil 
coyote springs pge manages the price risk of natural gas supply for coyote springs through financial contracts up to months in advance  while physical supplies are generally purchased within months of delivery and based on anticipated operation of the plant 
coyote springs utilizes  dth per day of natural gas when operating at full capacity  with firm transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in alberta  canada 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available for coyote springs for the foreseeable future  based on anticipated operation of the plant 
although coyote springs was designed to also operate on fuel oil  such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations 
purchased power pge supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its retail load requirements 
the company utilizes short and long term wholesale power purchase contracts in an effort to 
table of contents provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis 
such contracts have original terms ranging from one month to years and expire at varying dates through pge s medium term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions 
the strategy allows the company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery 
by purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period  pge mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel 
the company s major power purchase contracts consist of the following also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts capacity exchange pge has two contracts that provide pge with firm capacity to help meet the company s peak loads 
the contract representing mw of capacity expires in may and the contract representing mw of capacity expires in december hydro the company has three contracts that provide for the purchase of power generated from hydroelectric projects with an aggregate capacity of mw and which expire between and in addition  pge has the following mid columbia hydro pge has long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington for a portion of the output of three hydroelectric projects on the mid columbia river 
the contract representing mw of capacity expires in and the contract representing mw of capacity expires in although the projects currently provide a total of mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon river flows 
confederated tribes pge has a long term agreement under which the company purchases  at market prices  the tribes interest in the output of the pelton round butte hydroelectric project 
although the agreement provides mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon river flows 
the term of the agreement coincides with the term of the ferc license for this project  which expires in the tribes may elect to sell its output to another party with a one year notice to pge 
wind pge has three contracts that provide for the purchase of renewable wind generated electricity and which extend to various dates between and although these contracts provide a total of mw of capacity  actual energy received is dependent upon wind conditions 
solar pge has three agreements to purchase power generated from photovoltaic solar projects  which expire between and these projects have a combined generating capacity of mw 
in addition  the company operates  and purchases power from four solar projects with an aggregate of approximately mw of capacity 
other these primarily consist of long term contracts to purchase power from various counterparties  including other pacific northwest utilities  over terms extending into short term contracts these contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length 
they are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the company s load requirement 
pge also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers 
such purchases are made under contracts that range in duration from minutes to less than one month
