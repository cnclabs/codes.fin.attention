item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results 

table of contents advisory fees we earn advisory fees on the accounts that we manage for institutional clients  retail clients  mutual funds and other investment funds 
on our institutional accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of our clients pay us performance fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a lower base fee  but allows for us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
as of december   we sub advised twelve sec registered mutual funds that each have an initial two year term and are subject to annual renewal by each fund s board of directors pursuant to the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
nine of these twelve sub investment advisory agreements are beyond their initial two year terms as of december  in addition  we sub advise nine offshore funds 
pursuant to these agreements  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule  in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of assets under management  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts 
the majority of the advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts are based on the value of aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or in advance 
advisory fees on certain of our institutional accounts  and with respect to all of the mutual funds that we sub advise  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value of the account 
advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ  as described above 
our client relationships and distribution approach we manage separate accounts on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals and  as of december   acted as sub investment adviser for twelve sec registered mutual funds and nine offshore funds 
we believe that strong relationships with our clients are critical to our ability to succeed and to grow our aum 
in building these relationships  we have focused our efforts where we can efficiently access and service large pools of sophisticated clients with our team of dedicated marketing and client service professionals 
we distribute our products to institutional and retail clients primarily through the efforts of our internal sales team  who calls on them directly and on the consultants who serve them  as well as through the marketing programs of our sub investment advisory partners 
since our objective is to attract long term investors with an investment horizon in excess of three years  our sales and client service efforts focus on educating our investors regarding our disciplined value investment process and philosophy 
our marketing effort is led by our eight person business development team  which is responsible for identifying and marketing to prospective institutional clients  responding to requests for investment management proposals  and developing and maintaining relationships with independent consultants 
direct institutional relationships since our inception  we have directly offered institutional investment products to public and corporate pension funds  endowments  foundations and taft hartley plans 
wherever possible  we have sought to develop direct relationships with the largest us institutional investors  a universe we define to include plan sponsors with greater than million in plan assets 
over the past few years  we have focused on expanding this direct calling effort to potential institutional clients outside of the united states 

table of contents investment consultants we estimate that approximately of all retirement plan assets are advised by investment consultants  with a relatively small number of these consultants representing a significant majority of these relationships 
as a result of a consistent servicing effort over our history  we have built strong relationships with those consulting firms that we believe are the most important and believe that most of them rate our investment strategies favorably 
new accounts sourced through consultant led searches have been a large driver of our historical growth and are expected to be a major component of our future growth 
we seek to develop direct relationships with accounts sourced through consultant led searches by our ongoing marketing and client service efforts  as described below under client service 
sub investment advisory distribution we have established relationships with mutual fund and fund providers domestically and internationally  who offer us opportunities to efficiently access new market segments through sub investment advisory roles 
we sub advise a mutual fund that is advised by john hancock advisers  namely the john hancock classic value fund 
as of december   this fund represented billion  or  of our aum 
for the years ended december    and approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenue was generated from our sub investment advisory agreement with john hancock advisers 
we currently sub advise three mutual funds that are advised by the vanguard group 
in august  we expanded our sub advisory relationship with the vanguard group as we were hired as a co manager to manage approximately of the vanguard windsor fund 
as of december   these three mutual funds represented billion  or  of our aum 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was generated from our sub investment advisory agreement with the vanguard group 
our sub investment advisory agreement with the vanguard windsor fund represented substantially all of this revenue during this period 
for the years ended december  and  less than of our total revenue was generated from our sub investment advisory agreement with the vanguard group 
high net worth advisory firms we have accessed the high net worth segment of the investing community through relationships with wealth advisers who utilize our investment strategies in investment programs they construct for their clients 
similar to our approach with consultants  we have targeted select firms around the world serving the family office and ultra high net worth market 
we believe this approach leads to an efficient client servicing model and strong relationships with wealth advisers  who ultimately view us as partners in their investment programs 
occasionally  we establish direct separate account relationships with high net worth individuals 
client service our client service team s efforts are instrumental to maintaining our direct relationships with institutional and individual separate account clients  and developing direct relationships with separate accounts sourced through consultant led searches 
we have a dedicated client service team  which is primarily responsible for addressing all ongoing client needs  including periodic updates and reporting requirements 
our business development team assists in providing ongoing client service to existing institutional accounts 
our institutional distribution  sales and client service efforts are also supported  as necessary  by members of our investment team 
our client service team consists of individuals with both general business backgrounds and investment research experience 
our client service team members are fully integrated into our research team  attending both research and company management meetings to ensure our clients receive primary information 
as appropriate  we introduce members of our research and portfolio management team into client portfolio reviews to ensure that our clients are exposed to the full breadth of our investment resources 
we also provide quarterly reports to our clients in order to share our investment perspectives with them 
we additionally meet and hold conference calls regularly with clients to share perspectives on the portfolio and the current investment environment 

table of contents competition we compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms  commercial banks  broker dealers  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
in order to grow our business  we must be able to compete effectively to maintain existing aum and attract additional aum 
historically  we have competed for aum principally on the basis of the performance of our investment strategies  our clients perceptions of our drive  focus and alignment of our interests with theirs  the quality of the service we provide to our clients and the duration of our relationships with them  our brand recognition and reputation within the investing community  the range of products we offer  and the level of advisory fees we charge for our investment management services 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to attract highly qualified investment professionals and retain our existing employees 
for additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face  see item a risk factors risks related to our business the investment management business is intensely competitive 
employees at december   we had full time employees  consisting of research department personnel  traders  client service and marketing personnel  employees in operations  and legal  compliance and finance personnel

table of contents item a 
risk factors we face a variety of significant and diverse risks  many of which are inherent in our business 
described below are the risks we currently believe could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
risks related to our business our primary source of revenue is derived from management fees  which are directly tied to our assets under management 
fluctuations in aum may directly impact our revenue and earnings 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from management fees paid by our clients  based on a percentage of the market value of our aum 
any decline and or significant impairment in aum may greatly affect our revenue and earnings and could occur due to a variety of factors  including poor performance of our strategies poor performance of our investment strategies may result in decreased market value of aum 
in addition  underperformance could impact our ability to maintain our existing client base and develop new relationships  both of which could negatively impact aum 
poor market environment we could expect our business to generate lower revenue in a depressed equities market or general economic downturn 
any decline in the market value of securities held in client portfolios due to such adverse conditions could lower aum significantly and lead to a decrease in revenue 
investor sentiment in a poor equities market environment could also decrease inflows and increase outflows from our investment strategies in favor of investments perceived as more attractive 
geo political conditions as a company that invests in both us and non us markets  and with a global client base  our business is subject to changing conditions in the global financial markets  and may also be affected by worldwide political  social and economic conditions  all of which could negatively impact aum 
termination of significant relationships as of december   four client relationships represented of our aum 
for the year ended december   these relationships represented of our total revenue 
our clients can generally terminate our advisory agreements or reduce assets managed upon short notice and for any reason  and there can be no assurance that our agreements with respect to these relationships will remain in place 
the termination of any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenue and earnings  and we may not be able to establish relationships with other clients in order to replace the lost revenue and earnings 
intermediary dependence new accounts sourced through consultant led searches have been a large driver of our inflows in the past  and are expected to be a major component of our inflows going forward 
in addition  we have established relationships with certain mutual fund providers who have offered us opportunities to access certain market segments through sub investment advisory roles 
we have also accessed the high net worth segment of the investing community through relationships with well respected wealth advisers who utilize our investment strategies in investment programs they construct for their clients 
our intermediaries routinely review and evaluate our organization and the services we offer  and poor evaluations may result in client outflows and impact our ability to attract new assets through such intermediaries 
during  the majority of our investment strategies have outperformed their benchmarks  particularly those with european exposure 
improved market conditions for the year have significantly contributed to asset inflows 
however  no assurance can be given that improved market conditions will continue indefinitely  and there can be no assurance that there will not be declines in our aum  revenue and profitability in the future 
market pressures to lower our advisory fees could lead to a decline in our profit margin and increase the volatility of our revenue and earnings 
market pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower fees in the asset management industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure going 
table of contents forward 
additionally  a shift in the composition of our aum from higher to lower fee generating client relationships may result in a decrease in revenue  even if our aggregate level of aum remains unchanged or increases 
a small portion of our investment advisory revenue is currently derived from performance fees 
we generally earn performance fees under certain client agreements according to the performance in the accounts relative to an agreed upon benchmark 
this fee structure results in a lower base fee but allows for us to earn higher fees if the investment strategy outperforms the benchmark 
in addition  some performance based fee arrangements include high water mark provisions  which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target  it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance based fees 
therefore  if we fail to achieve the performance target for a particular period  we will not earn a performance fee for that period and  for accounts with a high water mark provision  our ability to earn future performance fees may be impaired 
during fiscal years and  we earned million and million in performance fees  respectively 
an increase in performance fees  or in performance based fee arrangements with clients  could create greater fluctuations in our revenue and earnings 
the potential decreases in management fees and uncertainty in performance fee income could lead to volatility in our profit margins and impact our revenue and earnings 
loss of key employees  and difficulties in attracting qualified investment professionals  could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our strategies  which may lead to a decrease in revenue and profitability 
the success of our business largely depends on the participation of richard s 
pzena  john p 
goetz  william l 
lipsey  antonio despirito  iii  and michael d 
peterson  our ceo  two presidents  and two executive vice presidents  respectively 
their professional reputations  expertise in investing  and relationships with our clients and within the investing community in the us and abroad are critical to executing our business strategy and attracting and retaining clients 
accordingly  the retention of these individuals is crucial to our future success 
there is no guarantee that they will not resign  join our competitors or form a competing company 
the terms of the current operating agreement of our operating company restrict each of these individuals from competing with us or soliciting our clients or employees during the term of their employment with us and for a certain period thereafter 
the penalty for breach of these restrictive covenants will be the forfeiture of a number of class b units held by the individual and his permitted transferees as of the earlier of the date of his breach or the termination of his employment  unless our board of directors  in its sole discretion  determines otherwise 
although we may also seek specific performance of these restrictive covenants  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this relief 
further  after this post employment restrictive period  we will not be able to prohibit them from competing with us or soliciting our clients or employees 
if any of these individuals were to join a competitor or form a competing company  some of our current clients or other prominent members of the investing community could choose to invest with that competitor rather than us 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to retain the senior members of our investment team and to recruit additional qualified investment professionals 
however  we may not be successful in our efforts to retain them  as the market for investment professionals is extremely competitive 
our portfolio managers possess substantial experience and expertise in investing and  in particular  our classic value investment approach  which requires significant qualitative judgments as to the future earnings power of currently underperforming businesses 
our portfolio managers also have significant relationships with our clients 
accordingly  the loss of any of our senior investment professionals could limit our ability to successfully execute our classic value investment approach and  therefore  sustain the performance of our investment strategies  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of revenue and earnings 

table of contents future growth of our business may place significant demands on our resources and employees  and may increase our expenses 
future growth of our business may place significant demands on our infrastructure  our investment team and other employees  which may increase our expenses 
in addition  we are required to continuously develop our infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market  as well as compliance with legal and regulatory developments 
we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and operational controls  implementing new or updated information and financial systems  and procedures and training  and managing and appropriately sizing our work force  and other components of our business on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the growth of our business effectively  or that we will be able to continue to grow  and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses 
the potential inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
in recent years  we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology  and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand these capabilities in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
we face risks  and corresponding potential costs and expenses  associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries 
we offer investment management services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
in order to remain competitive  we must be proactive and prepared to deploy necessary resources when growth opportunities present themselves 
the necessary resources and or personnel may be unavailable to take full advantage of strategic opportunities when they appear  or that strategic decisions can be efficiently implemented 
local regulatory environments may vary widely  as well as the adequacy and sophistication of each 
local requirements or needs may also place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources  such as meeting local requirements and complying with local industry standards 
finding and hiring additional  well qualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies  procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain a challenge as we expand our operations internationally 
moreover  regulators in non us jurisdictions could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our investment products in their respective markets 
any of these local requirements  activities  or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenue and income from operating in the jurisdiction 
the investment management business is intensely competitive 
competition in the investment management business is based on a variety of factors  including investment performance  investor perception of an investment manager s drive  focus and alignment of interest  quality of service provided to  and duration of  relationships with clients  business reputation  and level of fees charged for services 
we compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms  commercial banks  broker dealers  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
our competitive risks are heightened by the fact that some of our competitors may invest according to different investment styles or in alternative asset classes which the markets may perceive as more attractive than our investment approach in the public equity markets 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could be reduced  and our business could be materially affected 
a change of control could result in termination of our sub investment advisory and investment advisory agreements 
pursuant to the investment company act  each of the sub investment advisory agreements for the sec registered mutual funds that we sub advise automatically terminates upon its deemed assignment  and a fund s board and shareholders must approve a new agreement in order for us to continue to act as its sub investment adviser 
in addition  pursuant to the investment advisers act  each of our investment advisory 
table of contents agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client 
a sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an assignment pursuant to both the investment company act and the investment advisers act 
such an assignment may be deemed to occur in the event that the holders of the class b units of our operating company exchange enough of their class b units for shares of our class a common stock such that they no longer own a controlling interest in us 
if such a deemed assignment occurs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients whose funds are managed pursuant to separate accounts  or the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the sec registered funds that we sub advise 
an assignment  actual or constructive  would trigger these termination and consent provisions and  unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained  could adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts  resulting in the loss of aum and a corresponding loss of revenue 
extensive regulation of our business has been and will be expensive and time consuming  and exposes us to the potential for significant penalties  including fines or limitations on our ability to conduct our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation of our investment management business and operations 
as a registered investment adviser  the sec oversees our activities pursuant to its regulatory authority under the investment advisers act 
in addition  we must comply with certain requirements under the investment company act with respect to the sec registered funds for which we act as sub investment adviser 
each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services  including the authority to grant  and  in specific circumstances to cancel  permissions to carry on particular businesses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines  censure  suspensions of personnel or other sanctions  including revocation of our registration as an investment adviser 
even if a sanction imposed against us is small in monetary amount  the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of such sanctions by regulators could harm our reputation  result in withdrawal by our clients and or impede our ability to retain clients and develop new client relationships 
as we expand into the international market  we will also be under the regulatory scope of local regulatory authorities and non compliance with any of these authorities may result in fines  sanctions and inability to operate in that local market 
we also face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities  including extended investigation and surveillance activity  adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations  and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us  and are not designed to protect our stockholders 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to ongoing modification and further regulation 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act is one such example 
while we do not believe that the dodd frank act will fundamentally change the investment management industry  certain provisions may have unintended consequences on the financial market as a whole that could negatively affect our business 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are still subject to rulemaking and will continue to take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate both the impact on the manner in which we conduct business as well as the increased regulatory requirements and related compliance costs 
also  we are required to implement specific corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley or sox 
our management is required to conduct an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and include a report on our internal controls in our annual reports on form k pursuant to section of sox 
in addition  we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we will continue to incur costs in order to maintain our internal control over financial reporting and comply with section of sox  including necessary auditing and legal fees  and costs associated with accounting  internal audit  information technology  compliance and administrative staff 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal 
table of contents control over financial reporting  this could lead to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  thus adversely affecting the value of our common stock 
changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to income as well as non income based taxes  in both the us and us jurisdictions 
we are also subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions 
tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these potential audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential audits  and the actual outcomes of these potential audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition 
changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate and earnings 
certain changes in accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec or other standard setting bodies could have a material impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
we are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
as such  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting and or financial reporting standards issued by recognized accounting standard setters or regulators  such as the fasb and the sec 
in addition  the fasb is currently working with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and to facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs 
these projects may result in different accounting principles under gaap  which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results 
a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs would also have a material impact on our financial statements should ifrs be incorporated into the financial reporting system for us companies 
inadequate business continuity plans could lead to material financial loss  reputational harm and inability to continue business 
we rely heavily on our financial  accounting  trading  compliance and other data processing systems 
any failure or interruption of these systems  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  act of terrorism or war  security breach or otherwise  could result in a disruption of our business  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage  and thus materially adversely affect our business 
although we have back up systems in place and have taken other protective measures  our back up procedures and capabilities in the event of a failure or interruption may not be adequate and our technology system may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other events that have a security impact 
we depend on our headquarters in new york city for the continued operation of our business 
a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business  or directly affecting our headquarters  may have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption 
we have a sound business continuity plan in place that is tested on a yearly basis  but there can be no assurance that this plan will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption 
operational risks  including any significant limitation  failure or security breach of our software applications  technology or other systems critical to our operations  may disrupt our business or cause us to lose sensitive and confidential information 
as part of our normal operations  we rely on secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential client and firm information through computer systems and networks 
breach of such systems and networks could lead to loss of confidential client and proprietary information  liability for stolen information  additional cost to repair damage and prevent future incidents and litigation cost from loss of information 
we maintain 
table of contents and rely on a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is prevented or timely detected 
however  our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access or may be corrupted by computer virus  malicious software or access by unauthorized individuals especially when related to portable devices 
we take precautions to password protect all portable devices but that will not prevent unauthorized access if the device is misplaced or lost 
loss of confidential information will greatly harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to maintain current or attract new relationships 
the investment management industry faces substantial litigation risks which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us 
we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for integrity and high caliber professional services to attract and retain clients 
as a result  dissatisfaction with our services could be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses 
if our clients suffer significant losses  or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services  such as for breach of trading guidelines and or perceived conflicts of interest  we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct  breach of fiduciary duty  or breach of contract 
these risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  or cause significant reputational harm to us 
for information on our legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
insurance coverage may not protect us from all of the liabilities that could arise from the risks inherent in our business 
we maintain insurance coverage focused on reducing potential losses related to our operations 
we purchase insurance in amounts  and against risks  that we consider appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  that a claim or claims will be completely covered by insurance or  if covered  will not exceed the limits of our existing insurance coverage 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  we may be exposed to substantial liability 
insurance costs are impacted by market conditions  our risk profile  and may increase significantly over relatively short periods 
renewals of insurance policies may result in additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co insurance liability 
furthermore  we do not carry any key man insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key employees 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and could impact our future performance 
in addition  insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses in the event our business continuity plan fails and our operations are significantly disrupted 
risks related to our investment strategies our classic value investments subject the performance of our investment strategies to the risk that the companies in which we invest may not achieve the level of earnings recovery that we initially expect  or at all 
we generally invest in companies after they have experienced  or are expected by the market to soon experience  a shortfall in their historic earnings  due to an adverse business development  management error  accounting scandal or other disruption  and before there is clear evidence of earnings recovery or business momentum 
while very few investors are willing to invest when companies lack earnings visibility  our classic value investment approach seeks to capture the return that can be obtained by investing in a company before the market has confidence in its ability to achieve earnings recovery 
however  our investment approach entails the risk that the companies included in our portfolios are not able to execute as we had expected when we originally invested in them  thereby reducing the performance of our strategies 
since our positions in these investments are often substantial  there is the risk that we may be unable to find willing purchasers for our investments when we decide to sell them 
many of our strategies construct concentrated portfolios  
table of contents generally ranging from to holdings  of companies underperforming their historical earnings power  which is subject to a higher risk of underperformance relative to benchmarks than the investment approaches of some of our competitors 
since we apply the same investment process across all of our investment strategies  utilizing one analyst team  and given the overlapping universes of many of our investment strategies  we could have common positions and industry or sector concentrations across many of our investment strategies at the same time 
as such  factors leading one of our investment strategies to underperform may lead other strategies to underperform simultaneously 
our investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions 
our products are best suited for investors with long term investment horizons 
in order for our classic value investment approach to yield attractive returns  we must typically hold securities for an average of three to five years 
our investment strategies may not perform well during certain periods of time 
the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the economy and the financial markets beginning in the second half of  and continuing through early  created difficult conditions for most companies  including many of those in which we invest 
in addition  our strategies may not perform well during points in the economic cycle when value oriented stocks are relatively less attractive 
for instance  during the late stages of an economic cycle  investors may purchase relatively expensive stocks in order to obtain access to above average growth  as was the case in the late s 
value oriented strategies may also experience weakness during periods when the markets are focused on one investment thesis or sector 
even when securities prices are rising generally  portfolio performance can be affected by our investment approach 
the classic value approach has outperformed the market in some economic and market environments and underperformed it in others 
in particular  a prolonged period in which the growth style of investing outperforms the value style may cause our investment strategy to go out of favor with clients  consultants and sub advised relationships 
our investment strategy may be less favored during certain time periods for other reasons as well  including due to perceived riskiness or volatility of our approach 
poor performance relative to peers  coupled with changes in personnel  extensive periods in particular market environments  or other difficulties may result in decline in aum 
our investment process requires us to conduct extensive fundamental research on any company before investing  which may result in missed investment opportunities and reduce the performance of our investment strategies 
we take a considerable amount of time to complete the in depth research projects that our investment process requires before adding any security to our portfolio 
our process requires that we take this time to understand the company and the business well enough to make an informed decision as to whether we are willing to own a significant position in a company that does not yet have earnings visibility 
however  the time we take to make this judgment may cause us to miss the opportunity to invest in a company that has a sharp and rapid earnings recovery 
any such missed investment opportunities could adversely impact the performance of our investment strategies 
our global focused value  international ex us focused value  global expanded value  international ex us expanded value  european focused value and emerging markets focused value strategies consist primarily of investments in the securities of issuers located outside of the united states  which may involve foreign currency exchange  political  social and economic uncertainties and risks 
our global focused value  international ex us focused value  global expanded value  international ex us expanded value  european focused value and emerging markets focused value strategies  which together represented billion  billion  and billion of our aum as of december   and  respectively  are primarily invested in securities of companies located outside the united states 
investments in non us issuers may be affected by political  social and economic uncertainty affecting a country or region in which we are invested 
many emerging financial markets are not as developed  or as efficient  as the us financial market  and  as a result  liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may 
table of contents increase 
the legal and regulatory environments  including financial accounting standards and practices  may also be different  and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies 
these risks could adversely impact the performance of our strategies that are invested in securities of non us issuers 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will affect aum as we do not engage in any hedging activities for these portfolios and continue to market these products as unhedged 
due to these factors  our aum may fluctuate from one reporting period to another causing volatility in earnings 
risks related to our structure we are dependent upon distributions from our operating company to make distributions to our class a stockholders  and to pay taxes and other expenses 
we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership units of our operating company 
we have no independent means of generating revenue and cash flow 
our operating company is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and  as such  is not itself subject to us federal income tax 
instead  its taxable income is allocated to its members  including us  pro rata according to the number of membership units each owns 
accordingly  we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of our operating company 
we also incur expenses related to our operations 
we intend to have our operating company distribute cash to its members in an amount at least equal to that necessary to cover their tax liabilities  if any  with respect to the earnings of our operating company 
to the extent we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations  and our operating company is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable laws or regulations  or contractual restrictions  or does not have sufficient earnings to make these distributions  we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and run our business and  thus  our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available to borrow under such circumstances on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we are required to pay certain former and current members of our operating company who sold to us membership units of our operating company in october  and the other holders of class b units of our operating company who subsequently have exchanged and will exchange their class b units for shares of our class a common stock  most of the tax benefit of any amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with these sales of membership units and any future exchanges of class b units 
as part of the reorganization we implemented with our initial public offering ipo  we purchased membership units of our operating company from three of its members  or the selling members 
in addition  holders of class b units may  at least once each year  exchange their class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock 
these purchases and subsequent exchanges have and are expected to continue to result in increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company that otherwise would not have been available 
these increases in tax basis have and are expected to continue to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future  although the internal revenue service irs might challenge all or part of this tax basis increase  and a court might sustain such a challenge 
pursuant to a tax receivable agreement dated october   among the selling members  all holders of class b units after our october ipo  and us  we are required to pay the selling members  and any holders of class b units who elect to exchange their class b units for shares of our class a common stock  of the amount of the cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increases in amortizable tax basis due to the sale to us of their membership units 
the actual increase in tax basis  as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement  will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the price of our class a common stock at the time of the exchange  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable  the amount and timing of our income  and the tax rates then applicable 
payments under the tax receivable agreement are expected to give rise to certain additional tax benefits attributable to further increases in basis 
any such benefits are covered by the tax receivable agreement and will increase the amounts due thereunder 
we expect that  as a 
table of contents result of the size and increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company attributable to our interest therein  the payments that we may make to these members likely will be substantial 
if we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement early  we will be obligated to make an early termination payment to the selling and converting shareholders  based upon the net present value of all payments that would be required to be paid by us 
if certain change of control events were to occur  we would also be obligated to make an early termination payment 
were the irs to successfully challenge the tax basis increases described above  we would not be reimbursed for any payments made under the tax receivable agreement 
as a result  in certain circumstances  we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings 
risks related to our class a common stock the market price and trading volume of our class a common stock may be volatile  which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our class a common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume of our class a common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
if the market price of our class a common stock declines significantly  you may be unable to resell your shares of our class a common stock at or above your purchase price  if at all 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our class a common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
the market price of our class a common stock could decline due to the large number of shares of our class a common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of class b units of our operating company 
pursuant to the operating agreement of our operating company  on at least one date designated by us each year  certain holders of class b units may exchange up to of their class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the operating agreement 
also  as of october   the fourth anniversary of our initial public offering  the non employee members of our operating company may exchange all of their vested class b units  in accordance with the timing restrictions set forth in the operating agreement 
pursuant to the resale and registration rights agreement  dated october   among the holders of class b units and us  on at least one date designated by us each year these holders may resell the shares of class a common stock issued to them upon the exchange of up to of their class b units  or  in the case of non employee members  all of their class b units 
we filed a form s registration statement  which became effective in february  in order to register our issuance to these holders of  shares of class a common stock issuable upon exchange of all class b units outstanding immediately after the consummation of our operating company s reorganization 
on january   the sec declared effective a subsequent registration statement on form s which registers the resale of  shares of our class a common stock by the selling stockholders named therein 
we designated august   march   september  and march  as the   and exchange dates 
certain executive officers  employee members  and non employee members  elected to exchange an aggregate of    and  respectively  of their class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock  which  with the exception of those held by our executive officers  are freely tradable 
the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales pursuant to the form s registration statements  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future  at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor  which could also adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock and to designate the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of our preferred stock  each without any vote or action by our stockholders 
we could issue a series of preferred stock to impede the consummation of a merger  tender offer or other takeover attempt 
the anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may impede takeover attempts  or other transactions  that may be in the best interests of our stockholders and  in particular  our class a stockholders 
in addition  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts  or other transactions  that our stockholders may favor 
control by our class b stockholders of of the combined voting power of our common stock may give rise to conflicts of interest 
our class b stockholders collectively hold approximately of the combined voting power of our common stock 
these stockholders consist of five of our named executive officers  of our other employees  certain other members of our operating company  including one of our directors and his related entities  and six former employees 
holders of shares of our class b common stock have entered into a class b stockholders agreement with respect to all shares of class b common stock then held by them and any additional shares of class b common stock they may acquire in the future 
pursuant to this agreement  they will vote these shares of class b common stock together on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders 
to the extent that we cause our operating company to issue additional class b units  which may be granted  subject to vesting  to our employees pursuant to the pim llc equity incentive plan  these employees will be entitled to receive an equivalent number of shares of our class b common stock  subject to the condition that they agree to enter into this class b stockholders agreement 
each share of our class b common stock entitles its holder to five votes per share for so long as the class b stockholders collectively hold of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
when a class b unit is exchanged for a share of our class a common stock  an unvested class b unit is forfeited due to the employee holder s failure to satisfy the conditions of the award agreement pursuant to which it was granted  or any class b unit is forfeited as a result of a breach of any restrictive covenants contained in our operating company s amended and restated operating agreement  a corresponding share of our class b common stock will automatically be redeemed by us 
for so long as our class b stockholders hold at least of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding  they will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs  including determinations with respect to acquisitions  dispositions  borrowings  issuances of securities  and the declaration and payment of dividends 
in addition  they will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval of stockholders  and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors  and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company 
our class b stockholders have the ability to prevent the consummation of mergers  takeovers or other transactions that may be in the best interests of our class a stockholders 
in particular  this concentration of voting power could deprive class a stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of class a common stock as part of a sale of our company  and could ultimately affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our common stock may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock 
each share of our class a common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally  while each share of our class b common stock entitles its holder to five votes for so long as the number of shares of class b common stock represents of the total number of shares of our 
table of contents common stock outstanding 
the difference in voting rights could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors view  or any potential future purchaser of our company views  the superior voting rights of the class b common stock to have more value

however  our board of directors may  in its discretion  decrease the level of dividends  or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely 
in addition  as a holding company  we depend upon the ability of pzena investment management  llc to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders 
we expect to cause pzena investment management  llc to make distributions to its members  including us 
however  the ability of pzena investment management  llc to make such distributions is subject to its operating results  cash requirements and financial condition  and applicable delaware laws which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members  as well as any contractual restrictions 
if  as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we are unable to generate sufficient distributions from our business  we may not be able to make  or may have to reduce or eliminate  the payment of dividends on our class a common stock 
because of these various limitations and restrictions  we have  in the past  had to suspend our quarterly dividend payment

we use non gaap measures  discussed in further detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation non gaap net income in part ii of this annual report to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business 
we believe non gaap measures provide information to better analyze our operations between periods  and over time 
we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders  if any 
when and if our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends  or any of our financing facilities or other agreements restrict us from doing so 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise

our advisory fee income is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided 
following the preferred method identified in the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  income from performance fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period  when all contingencies are resolved 
our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum 
our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof 
in order to increase our aum and expand our business  we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients  and provide attractive returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our aum  and our ability to continue to attract clients  will depend on a variety of factors including  among other things our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service  the relative investment performance of our investment strategies  as compared to competing products and market indices  
table of contents competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors  general economic conditions  investor sentiment and confidence  and our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients 
for our institutional accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule  which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
pursuant to our sub investment advisory agreements with our retail clients  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of aum  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts 
certain of our clients pay us fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a lower base fee  but allows us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
the majority of advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts is based on the value of our aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or advance 
advisory fees on certain of our institutional accounts  and with respect to all of our retail accounts  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value 
advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ as described above 
our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios  and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients  distribution of aum among our investment strategies  which have differing fee schedules  distribution of aum between institutional accounts and retail accounts  for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees  and the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid performance fees 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense  as well as general and administrative expense 
our largest expense is compensation and benefits  which includes the salaries  bonuses  equity based compensation  and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our employee members and employees 
compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked against relevant industry and geographic peer groups in order to attract and retain qualified personnel 
general and administrative expense includes office rent and other expenses  professional and outside services fees  depreciation  and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research  trading  and portfolio accounting systems 
our occupancy related costs and professional services expenses  in particular  generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the overall size and scale of our business operations 
we incur additional expenses associated with being a public company for  among other things  director and officer insurance  director fees  sec reporting and compliance including sarbanes oxley and dodd frank compliance  professional fees  transfer agent fees  and other similar expenses 
these additional expenses have and will continue to reduce our net income 

table of contents our expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  awards of equity to our employees and employee members of our operating company  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  and general and administrative expenses  such as rent  professional service fees and data related costs  incurred  as necessary  to run our business 
other income expense other income expense is derived primarily from investment income or loss arising from our consolidated subsidiaries  income or loss generated by our investments in third party mutual funds  and interest income generated on our cash balances 
other income expense is also affected by changes in our estimates of the liability due to our selling and converting shareholders associated with payments owed to them under the tax receivable agreement which was executed in connection with our reorganization and initial public offering on october  as discussed further below under tax receivable agreement  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state  and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from our acquisitions of our operating company s units from our selling and converting shareholders 
we expect the interest and investment components of other income expense  in the aggregate  to fluctuate based on market conditions and the performance of our consolidated investment partnerships and other investments 
non controlling interests our operating company has historically consolidated the results of operations of the private investment partnerships over which we exercise a controlling influence 
we are the sole managing member of our operating company and control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and outside investors interest in our operating company  we have reflected their membership interests as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
operating results assets under management and flows as of december   our approximately billion of aum was invested in a variety of value oriented investment strategies  representing distinct capitalization segments of us and us equity markets 
the performance of our largest investment strategies as of december  is further described below 
as of july   we launched a large cap expanded value strategy which  by asset size  is now one of our largest investment strategies 
we follow the same investment process for each of these strategies 
our investment strategies are distinguished by the market capitalization ranges from which we select securities for their portfolios  which we refer to as each strategy s investment universe  as well as the regions in which we invest and the degree to which we concentrate on a limited number of holdings 
while our investment process includes ongoing review of companies in the investment universes described below  our actual investments may include companies outside of the relevant market capitalization range at the time of our investment 
in addition  the number of holdings typically found in the portfolios of each of our investment strategies may vary  as described below

our revenues are generally correlated with the levels of our weighted average aum 
our weighted average aum fluctuates based on changes in the market value of accounts advised and managed by us  and on our fund flows 
since we are long term fundamental investors  we believe that our investment strategies yield the most benefits  and are best evaluated  over a long term timeframe 
we believe that our investment strategies are generally evaluated by our clients and our potential future clients based on their relative performance since inception  and the previous one year  three year  and five year periods 
there has typically been a correlation between our strategies investment performance and the size and direction of asset flows over the long term 
to the extent that our returns for these periods outperform client benchmarks  we would generally anticipate increased asset flows over the long term 
correspondingly  negative returns relative to client benchmarks could cause existing clients to reduce their exposure to our products  or hinder new client acquisition 
in addition  an increase in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in higher operating income and net income  while a decrease in weighted average aum and in revenues typically results in lower operating income  net income  and operating margins 
we would expect pressure on our operating income  net income and operating margins in the future if average aum and revenues were to decline

as discussed above  due to the substantially

this shift in mix was driven by retail inflows primarily associated with our assignment to manage of the vanguard windsor fund as of the beginning of august as well as net outflows in our institutional accounts 
to the extent that we experience further shifts in weighted average aum  our revenue could be affected 
our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

weighted average assets in retail accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in weighted average fees in retail accounts was due to the full year effect of the expiration of a prior year voluntary partial fee waiver for the john hancock classic value fund  and a higher mix of assets in our retail emerging markets focused value strategy  which carries a higher fee rate 
the timing of asset flows in our other retail accounts also contributed to the change in our retail weighted average fee rate

the million decrease in other non cash compensation was primarily due to a shift in compensation mix and a reduction in amortization associated with previously issued awards 
we would expect non cash compensation expense in subsequent years to depend on the size and composition of awards granted under our equity incentive plans 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in rent and real estate costs recognized during during the year ended december   we entered into a noncancelable sublease agreement for certain excess office space associated with our operating lease agreement

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through the cash generated by our operations 
distributions to members of our operating company are our largest use of cash from financing activities 
investing activities have historically been investments in our own investment strategies  purchases and sales of investments to fund our deferred compensation program  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents was million  inclusive of million in cash held by our consolidated subsidiaries 
advisory fees receivable was million 
we also had approximately million in investments and million in our cash and cash equivalents set aside to satisfy our obligations under our deferred compensation program 
we expect to fund the liquidity needs of our business in the next twelve months  and over the long term  primarily through cash generated from operations 
as an investment management firm  our business has been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
our liquidity is highly dependent on the revenue and income from our operations  which is directly related to our levels of aum 
for the year ended december   our weighted average aum and revenues decreased by and  respectively  compared to our weighted average aum and revenues for the year ended december  in determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including  among other things  cash  working capital  investments  long term liabilities  lease commitments  debt obligations  and operating company distributions 
compensation is our largest expense 
to the extent we deem necessary and appropriate to run our business  recognizing the need to retain our key personnel  we have the ability to change the absolute levels of our compensation packages  as well as change the mix of their cash and non cash components 
historically  we have not tied our level of compensation directly to revenue  as many wall street firms do 
correspondingly  there is not a linear relationship between our compensation and the revenues we generate 
this generally has the effect of increasing operating margins in periods of increased revenues  but can reduce operating margins when revenue declines 
we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data 
the result of this review directly influences management s recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels 
we anticipate that tax allocations and dividend equivalent payments to the members of our operating company  which consisted of of our employees  certain unaffiliated persons  former employees  and us  will continue to be a material financing activity 
cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations would increase should the taxable income of the operating company increase 
dividend equivalent payments will depend on our dividend policy and the discretion of our board of directors  as discussed below 
we do not anticipate meaningful outlays for internal investment or capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we believe that our lack of long term debt  and ability to vary cash compensation levels  have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs 
dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders 
when  and if  our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared 
our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations  particularly with respect to liquidity 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common shareholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not 
table of contents have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
on an annual basis  our board of directors has targeted a cash dividend payout ratio of approximately to of our non gaap net income  subject to growth initiatives and other funding needs 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the board of directors discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law

tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrent with our initial public offering  and the subsequent and future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company s operating agreement  has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company  which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us 
these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced  and are expected to continue to reduce  the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future

the operating company has made a provision for new york city unincorporated business tax ubt 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to go unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
each quarter  we re evaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future taxable income 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the million valuation allowance  recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company membership units  is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes  or variances in future projected operating performance  could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to earnings would result 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the institutional separate accounts we manage and the retail clients for which we act as sub investment adviser 
as noted in item a  risk factors  we could experience declines in aum due to poor performance of our investment strategies or a general economic downturn 
these conditions could lead to declines in revenue and profitability  and there can be no assurance that there will not be declines in our aum  revenue and profitability again in the future 
an economic downturn  and volatility in the global financial markets  could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
our revenue for the three years ended december  was generally derived from advisory fees  which are typically based on the market value of our aum  which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline  due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries  which consist primarily of marketable securities and investments in mutual funds 
at december   the fair value of these assets was million and million  respectively 
assuming a increase or decrease  the fair value would increase or decrease by million and million  respectively  at december  interest rate risk since the company does not have any debt that bears interest at a variable rate  it does not have any direct exposure to interest rate risk at december
