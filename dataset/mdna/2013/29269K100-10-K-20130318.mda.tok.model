overview the trust is a statutory trust created under the delaware statutory trust act in may the business and affairs of the trust are managed by the trustee 
the trustee has no authority over or responsibility for  and no involvement with  any aspect of the oil and gas operations or other activities on the underlying properties 
the delaware trustee has only minimal rights and duties that are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the delaware statutory trust act 
in connection with the closing of the initial public offering  on november   enduro contributed the net profits interest to the trust in exchange for  newly issued trust units 
the net profits interest entitles the trust to receive of the net profits from the sale and production of oil and natural gas attributable to the underlying properties that are produced during the term of the conveyance  which commenced on july  the trust is not subject to any pre set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the passage of time 
the trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following the trust  upon approval of the holders of at least of the outstanding trust units  sells the net profits interest  the annual cash proceeds received by the trust attributable to the net profits interest are less than million for each of any two consecutive years  the holders of at least of the outstanding trust units vote in favor of dissolution or the trust is judicially dissolved 
the trust is required to make monthly cash distributions of substantially all of its monthly cash receipts  after deducting the trust s administrative expenses  to holders of record generally the last business day of each calendar month on or before the th business day after the record date 
the net profits interest will be entitled to a share of the profits from and after july  attributable to production occurring on or after june  during  the trust paid one distribution  which was announced on november  the trust s first distribution related to net profits generated during the calculation period from july  through september  as provided in the conveyance 
the distribution primarily represented oil and natural gas production during the months of june and july and a portion of oil production related to august  while expenses were included for the full three months in the calculation period 
the amount of trust revenues and cash distributions to trust unitholders depends on  among other things oil and gas sales prices  volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold attributable to the underlying properties  production and development costs  price differentials  potential reductions or suspensions of production  and the amount and timing of trust administrative expenses 
results of operations year ended december  and period from inception through december  the trust was formed in may in connection with the closing of the initial public offering  on november   enduro contributed the net profits interest to the trust in exchange for  newly issued trust units

table of contents computation of net profits income received by the trust the trust s net profits income consists of monthly net profits attributable to the net profits interest 
net profits income for the year ended december  and the period from inception through december  was determined as shown in the following table year ended december  inception may  through december  gross profits oil sales natural gas sales total costs direct operating expenses lease operating expenses compression  gathering and transportation production  ad valorem and other taxes development expenses total settlement of hedge contracts net profits percentage allocable to net profits interest income from net profits interest trust general and administrative expenses and cash withheld for expenses distributable income excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and development expenses from the underlying properties was approximately million in this amount includes settlements of approximately million related to hedge contracts 
applying the net profits interest percentage of to the excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and development expenses results in income from the net profits interest to the trust prior to trust general and administrative expenses and cash withheld for expenses of approximately million for the year ended december  excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and development expenses from the underlying properties was approximately million from inception through december  this amount includes settlements of approximately million related to hedge contracts 
applying the net profits interest percentage of to the excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and development expenses results in income from the net profits interest to the trust prior to trust general and administrative expenses and cash withheld for expenses of approximately million for the period 
as the trust was not formed until may  and the conveyance of the net profits interest was not completed until november   the trust did not receive or disburse funds during the first ten months of total capital expenditures included in the net profits calculation during the year ended december  were approximately million as compared to capital expenditures of million during the period from inception through december  the period represented capital expenditures incurred during one quarter in capital expenditures increased during as a result of the full year of the net profits calculation but also due to certain capital expenditures that were excluded from the period for development drilling projects in the haynesville shale 
per the conveyance  enduro agreed to pay for up to million of 
table of contents estimated development expenses related to certain projects in the haynesville shale  thereby reducing the trust s share of development expenses 
during the period  capital totaling approximately million was incurred related to these projects that is not reflected in the calculation 
total lease operating expenses included in the net profits calculation during the twelve months ended december  were approximately million per boe 
for the period from inception through december   total lease operating expenses were approximately million 
production  ad valorem and other taxes included in the net profits calculation during the twelve months ended december  were approximately million  or of revenues 
for the period from inception through december   production  ad valorem and other taxes were million  or of revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  production  ad valorem and other taxes were higher during the period as the period only included revenues from months of oil and natural gas receipts  while expenses were included for three months  resulting in a higher percentage 
the trust paid general and administrative expenses of million during the year ended december  expenses paid during the period primarily consisted of fees for the preparation of tax information for unitholders  preparation of the trust s reserve report and annual report on form k for  financial statement audit fees  trustee fees  and new york stock exchange listing fees 
due to the limited period of activity during  the trustee paid general and administrative expenses of  from inception through december  during the period  the trust withheld million for general and administrative expenses 
outlook in  enduro expects capital to range from million million net to the trust s npi  focused on projects in the permian basin 
this capital primarily relates to four permian basin oil wells being drilled in the lost tank field in southeastern new mexico  in which enduro owns a working interest 
two of the lost tank wells were spud in december and are expected to be completed and producing in early these projects are anticipated to grow oil production during the year 
discussion and analysis of historical results of the underlying properties the following table sets forth revenues  direct operating expenses and the excess of revenues over direct operating expenses relating to the underlying properties for the six months ended june  and for the year ended december  derived from the historical revenues and direct operating expenses of the underlying properties included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

table of contents discussion and analysis of pro forma combined historical results of the underlying properties pro forma combined historical results for the year ended december  excess of revenues over direct operating expenses for the underlying properties was million for the year ended december  as a result of an increase in the average price received for the oil and natural gas sold 
revenues 
revenues from oil and natural gas sales were million as a result of an increase in the average price received for crude oil sold to per bbl for the year ended december  in addition  the average price received for natural gas sold was per mcf for the year ended december  lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses were million for the year ended december   which represented an per boe increase in the lease operating expense rate from the prior year 
gathering and processing expenses 
gathering and processing expenses were million for the year ended december  production and other taxes 
production and other taxes were million based on the increase in revenues from oil and natural gas sales on which these taxes are based 
liquidity and capital resources the trust s principal sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from the net profits interest and borrowing capacity under the letter of credit described below 
other than trust administrative expenses  including any reserves established by the trustee for future liabilities  the trust s only use of cash is for distributions to trust unitholders 
available funds are the excess cash  if any  received by the trust from the net profits interest and other sources such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the trustee in that month  over the trust s expenses paid for that month 
available funds are reduced by any cash the trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future expenses 
the trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for future liabilities of the trust 
if the trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are  or will be  insufficient to cover the trust s liabilities  the trustee may authorize the trust to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the trust that exceed cash held by the trust 
the trustee may authorize the trust to borrow from the any person  including the trustee or the delaware trustee or an affiliate thereof  although none of the trustee  the delaware trustee or any affiliate of either of them intends to lend funds to the trust 
the trustee may also cause the trust to mortgage its assets to secure payment of the indebtedness 
the terms of such indebtedness and security interest  if funds were loaned by the entity serving as trustee or delaware trustee or an affiliate thereof  would be similar to the terms which such entity would grant to a similarly situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship 
in addition  enduro has agreed to provide the trust with a million letter of credit to be used by the trust in the event that its cash on hand including available cash reserves is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses 
further  if the trust requires more than the million under the letter of credit to pay administrative expenses  enduro has agreed to loan funds to the trust necessary to pay such expenses 
if the trust borrows funds  draws on the letter of credit or enduro loans funds to the trust  no further distributions will be made to trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed or drawn are repaid 
except for the foregoing  the trust has no source of liquidity or capital resources 
the trustee has no current plans to authorize the trust to borrow money 
during the year ended december   the trust increased its cash reserve for future trust expenses by  to  at december   the trust had withheld  as cash reserves for future trust expenses 
since its formation  the trust has not borrowed any funds and no amounts have been drawn on the letter of credit 

table of contents cash held by the trustee as a reserve against future liabilities or for distribution at the next distribution date must be invested in interest bearing obligations of the united states government  money market funds that invest only in united states government securities  repurchase agreements secured by interest bearing obligations of the united states government  or bank certificates of deposit 
alternatively  cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a noninterest bearing account 
as substantially all of the underlying properties are located in mature fields  enduro does not expect future costs for the underlying properties to change significantly as compared to recent historical costs other than changes due to fluctuations in the cost of oilfield services generally 
the amounts received by enduro from the hedge contract counterparty upon settlement of the hedge contracts will reduce the operating expenses related to the underlying properties in calculating the net profits 
however  if the hedge payments received by enduro under the hedge contracts and other non production revenue exceed operating expenses during a period  the ability to use such excess amounts to offset operating expenses will be deferred  with interest accruing on such amounts at the prevailing prime rate  until the next period where the hedge payments and the other non production revenue are less than such expenses 
in addition  the aggregate amounts paid by enduro on settlement of the hedge contracts will reduce the amount of net profits paid to the trust 
the trust pays the trustee an administrative fee of  per year 
the trust pays the delaware trustee a fee of  per year 
the trust also incurs  either directly or as a reimbursement to the trustee  legal  accounting  tax and engineering fees  printing costs and other expenses that are deducted by the trust before distributions are made to trust unitholders 
the trust also is responsible for paying other expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity  including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to trust unitholders  tax return and form preparation and distribution  nyse listing fees  independent auditor fees and registrar and transfer agent fees 
the trust does not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the trust s liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements the trust has no off balance sheet arrangements 
the trust has not guaranteed the debt of any other party  nor does the trust have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt  losses or contingent obligations other than the commodity hedge contracts disclosed in the section quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
contractual obligations a summary of the trust s contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table payments due by year after total in thousands trustee administrative fee a a delaware trustee fee a a total a a 
table of contents a under the terms of the trust agreement  the trust pays an annual administrative fee of  to the trustee and  to the delaware trustee 
because the term of the net profits interest and the trust are not limited  the aggregate amounts of future payments cannot be calculated 
new accounting pronouncements as the trust s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis  most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the trust s financial statements  therefore  no new accounting pronouncements have been adopted or issued that would impact the financial statements of the trust 
critical accounting policies and estimates the trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report trust receipts of the net profits interest and payments of expenses incurred 
the net profits interest represents the right to receive revenues oil and natural gas sales  less direct operating expenses lease operating expenses and production and property taxes and development expenses of the underlying properties plus any payments made or net of payments received in connection with the settlement of certain hedge contracts  multiplied by 
cash distributions of the trust will be made based on the amount of cash received by the trust pursuant to terms of the conveyance creating the net profits interest 
the financial statements of the trust  as prepared on a modified cash basis  reflect the trust s assets  liabilities  trust corpus  earnings and distributions as follows a income from net profits interest is recorded when distributions are received by the trust  b distributions to trust unitholders are recorded when paid by the trust  c trust general and administrative expenses which includes the trustee s fees as well as accounting  engineering  legal  and other professional fees are recorded when paid  d cash reserves for trust expenses may be established by the trustee for certain expenditures that would not be recorded as contingent liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  e amortization of the investment in net profits interest is calculated on a unit of production basis and is charged directly to trust corpus 
such amortization does not affect cash earnings of the trust  and f the net profits interest in oil and natural gas properties is periodically assessed whenever events or circumstances indicate that the aggregate value may have been impaired below its total capitalized cost based on the underlying properties 
if an impairment loss is indicated by the carrying amount of the assets exceeding the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows of the net profits interest  then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value determined using discounted cash flows 
while these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  the modified cash basis of reporting revenues  expenses  and distributions is considered to be the most meaningful because monthly distributions to the trust unitholders are based on net cash receipts 
this comprehensive basis of accounting other than gaap corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the us securities and exchange commission as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic e  financial statements of royalty trusts 

table of contents the preparation of financial statements requires the trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
oil and gas reserves 
the proved oil and gas reserves for the underlying properties are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from original estimates 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions  including consideration of other factors  could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
the standardized measure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the current fair market value of proved reserves 
amortization of net profits interest 
the trust amortizes the investment in net profits interest using the units of production method 
the rate of recording amortization is dependent upon estimates of total proved reserves  which incorporate various assumptions and future projections 
if the estimates of total proved reserves decline significantly  the rate at which we record amortization expense may increase  reducing trust corpus 
such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on future economic conditions 
impairment of investment in net profits interest 
investment in the net profits interest is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired below its total capitalized cost based on the underlying properties 
if an impairment loss is indicated by the carrying amount of the assets exceeding the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows of the net profits interest  then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value determined using discounted cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedge contracts the trust is exposed to fluctuations in energy prices in the normal course of business due to the net profits interest in the underlying properties 
the revenues derived from the underlying properties depend substantially on prevailing crude oil prices and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices 
as a result  commodity prices affect the amount of cash flow available for distribution to the trust unitholders 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that enduro and its third party operators can economically produce 
to mitigate the negative effects of a possible decline in oil and natural gas prices on distributable income to the trust and to achieve more predictable cash flows  enduro entered into hedge contracts with respect to approximately and of expected oil and natural gas production for and  respectively  from the total proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties 
these hedge contracts include a combination of fixed price swaps  collars and floors 
these contracts reduce the exposure of the revenues from oil and natural gas production from the underlying properties  however  these contracts also limit the amount of cash available for distribution if 
table of contents prices increase above the fixed hedge price 
after december   none of the production attributable to the underlying properties will be hedged 
as a result  the amount of the cash distributions will be subject to the possibility of greater fluctuations after due to changes in oil and natural gas prices

for presentation purposes and for comparability among the various contracts  the contract prices were converted to nymex equivalent prices using estimated basis differentials in the over the counter futures market
