this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview berry plastics group  inc berry or the company is a leading provider of value added plastic consumer packaging and engineered materials with a track record of delivering high quality customized solutions to our customers 
our products utilize our proprietary research and development platform  which includes a continually evolving library of berry owned molds  patents  manufacturing techniques and technologies 
we sell our solutions predominantly into consumer oriented end markets  such as food and beverage  healthcare and personal care 
we believe our customers look to us for solutions that have high consumer impact in terms of form  function and branding 
representative examples of our products include drink cups  thin wall containers  bottles  specialty closures  prescription vials  specialty films  tape products and corrosion protection solutions 
we believe that we have created one of the largest product libraries in our industry  allowing us to be a comprehensive solution provider to our customers 
we have more than  customers  which consist of a diverse mix of leading national  mid sized regional and local specialty businesses 
the size and scope of our customer network allow us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with  and we believe partial to  our brand 
in fiscal  no single customer represented more than of net sales and our top ten customers represented of net sales 
we believe our manufacturing processes and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce expenses on items  such as raw materials  position us as a low cost manufacturer relative to our competitors 
for example  we believe based on management estimates that we are one of the largest global purchasers of plastic resins  at more than billion pounds per year  which gives us scaled purchasing savings 
executive summary business 
we operate in the following four segments rigid open top  rigid closed top together our rigid packaging business  engineered materials  and flexible packaging 
the rigid packaging business sells primarily containers  foodservice items  closures  overcaps  bottles  prescription containers  and tubes 
our engineered materials segment primarily sells pipeline corrosion protection solutions  tapes and adhesives  pe based film products and can liners 
the flexible packaging segment sells high barrier  multilayer film products as well as finished flexible packages such as printed bags and pouches 
raw material trends 
our primary raw material is plastic resin 
polypropylene and polyethylene account for the majority of our plastic resin purchases 
plastic resins are subject to price fluctuations  including those arising from supply shortages and changes in the prices of natural gas  crude oil and other petrochemical intermediates from which resins are produced 
the average industry prices  as published in chem data  per pound were as follows by fiscal year polyethylene butene film polypropylene st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter due to differences in the timing of passing through resin cost changes to our customers on escalator de escalator programs  segments are negatively impacted in the short term when plastic resin costs increase and are positively impacted when plastic resin costs decrease 
recently  the company has made progress towards shortening these timing lags  but we still have a number of customers whose prices adjust quarterly or less frequent based on various index prices 
this timing lag in passing through raw material cost changes could affect our results as plastic resin costs fluctuate 
outlook 
the company is impacted by general economic and industrial growth  plastic resin availability and affordability  and general industrial production 
our business has both geographic and end market diversity  which reduces the effect of any one of these factors on our overall performance 
our results are affected by our ability to pass through raw material cost changes to our customers  improve manufacturing productivity and adapt to volume changes of our customers 
we seek to improve our overall profitability by implementing cost reduction programs associated with our manufacturing  selling and general and administrative expenses 
in november  the company initiated a cost reduction plan designed to deliver meaningful cost savings and optimal equipment utilization 
this plan will result in several plant rationalizations 
the costs associated with this plan will primarily consist of one time costs associated with facility consolidation  including severance and termination benefits for employees of approximately million  other costs associated with exiting facilities of approximately million and non cash asset impairment charges of approximately million 
in addition  as part of this cost reduction plan the company estimates it will incur capital expenditures of approximately million 
overall these facility restructuring programs are projected to generate approximately million of annual operating savings when fully implemented 
these amounts are preliminary estimates based on the information currently available to management 
the plan is expected to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal recent developments initial public offering in october  the company completed an initial public offering and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
in conjunction with the initial public offering the company executed a for one stock split of the company s common stock 
the effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all periods presented 
transaction fees totaling million were included in paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
proceeds  net of transaction fees  of million and cash from operations were used to repurchase million of senior subordinated notes due september as part of the repurchase the company paid premiums of million and wrote off million of deferred financing fees 
tax receivable agreement in connection with the initial public offering  the company entered into an income tax receivable agreement tra that provides for the payment to pre initial public offering stockholders  option holders and holders of our stock appreciation rights  of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  foreign  state and local income tax that are actually realized or are deemed to be realized in the case of a change of control as a result of the utilization of our and our subsidiaries net operating losses attributable to periods prior to the initial public offering 
the company expects to pay between million and million in cash related to this agreement 
this range is based on the company assumptions using various items  including valuation analysis and current tax law 
the company recorded an obligation of million which was recognized as a reduction of paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the estimated tra obligation will be recorded as other expense income in the consolidated statement of operations 
payments under the tra are not conditioned upon the parties continued ownership of the company 
the balance at the end of fiscal was million 
during fiscal  the company made million of payments related to the tra with an additional million being paid in the first fiscal quarter of incremental term loan in february  the company entered into an incremental assumption agreement to increase the commitments under berry plastics corporation s existing term loan credit agreement by billion 
berry plastics corporation borrowed loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to the full amount of the commitments on such date 
the incremental term loans bear interest at libor plus per annum with a libor floor of  matures in february and are subject to customary amortization 
the proceeds from the incremental term loan  in addition to borrowings under the revolving credit facility  were used to a satisfy and discharge all of berry plastics corporation s outstanding i second priority senior secured floating rate notes due  ii first priority senior secured floating rate notes due  iii senior subordinated notes due and iv first priority senior secured notes due  which  in each case  were called for redemption in february and the related indentures and b pay related fees and expenses 
the company recognized a million loss on extinguishment of debt related to this debt refinancing

recent acquisitions we have a long history of acquiring and integrating companies 
we maintain an opportunistic acquisition strategy  which is focused on improving our long term financial performance  enhancing our market positions and expanding our product lines or  in some cases  providing us with a new or complementary product line 
in our acquisitions  we seek to obtain businesses for attractive post synergy multiples  creating value for our stockholders from synergy realization  leveraging the acquired products across our customer base  creating new platforms for future growth  and assuming best practices from the businesses we acquire 
the company has included the expected benefits of acquisition integrations within our unrealized synergies  which are in turn recognized in earnings after an acquisition has been fully integrated 
while the expected benefits on earnings is estimated at the commencement of each transaction  once the execution of the plan and integration occur  we are generally unable to accurately estimate or track what the ultimate effects have been due to system integrations and movements of activities to multiple facilities 
as historical business combinations have not allowed us to accurately separate realized synergies compared to what was initially identified  we measure the synergy realization based on the overall segment profitability post integration 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have in the past and may in the future incur charges related to reductions and rationalizations 
we also include the expected impact of our restructuring plans within our unrealized synergies which are in turn recognized in earnings after the restructuring plans are completed 
while the expected benefits on earnings is estimated at the commencement of each plan  due to the nature of the matters we are generally unable to accurately estimate or track what the ultimate effects have been due to movements of activities to multiple facilities

debt extinguishment 
debt extinguishment decreased by million during fiscal as a result of loss on extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal attributed to the write off of deferred fees  debt discount and the premiums paid related to the debt extinguishment of the company s second priority senior secured notes 
other income  net 
other income was million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these gains are attributed to the fair value adjustment for our interest rate swaps 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income tax expense benefit 
fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of million or an effective tax rate of compared to an income tax benefit of million or an effective tax rate of in fiscal due to the relative impact of permanent items on the pre tax income and establishment of valuation allowance for certain foreign losses where benefits are not expected to be realized 
income tax matters the company had unused united states federal operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income of million which begin to expire in through as of fiscal year end  the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will be available to offset future taxable income 
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million are available to the company indefinitely to reduce future years us federal income taxes 
the net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation under guidance from the internal revenue code  however  all of the company s federal net operating loss carryforwards should be available for use within the next five years 
as part of the effective tax rate calculation  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
the company has not provided a valuation allowance on its net federal net operating loss carryforwards in the united states because it has determined that future reversals of its temporary taxable differences will occur in the same periods and are of the same nature as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively  related to certain foreign and state deferred tax assets 
in connection with the initial public offering  the company entered into an income tax receivable agreement that provides for the payment to pre initial public offering stockholders  option holders and holders of our stock appreciation rights  of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  foreign  state and local income tax that are actually realized or are deemed to be realized in the case of a change of control as a result of the utilization of our and our subsidiaries net operating losses attributable to periods prior to the initial public offering 
the company expects to pay between million and million in cash related to this agreement 
this range is based on the company assumptions using various items  including valuation analysis and current tax law 
the company recorded an obligation of million which was recognized as a reduction of paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance at the end of fiscal was million 
liquidity and capital resources senior secured credit facility through our wholly owned subsidiary berry plastics corporation  we have senior secured credit facilities consisting of billion of term loans and a million asset based revolving line of credit credit facility 
billion of the term loan matures in april  billion of the term loan matures in february and the revolving line of credit matures in june  subject to certain conditions 
the availability under the revolving line of credit is the lesser of million or a defined borrowing base which is calculated based on available accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving line of credit allows up to million of letters of credit to be issued instead of borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
at the end of fiscal  the company had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  million outstanding letters of credit and a million borrowing base reserve providing unused borrowing capacity of million under the revolving line of credit 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at the end of fiscal our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the revolving credit facility  is calculated based on a numerator consisting of adjusted ebitda less pro forma adjustments  income taxes paid in cash and capital expenditures  and a denominator consisting of scheduled principal payments in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money  interest expense and certain distributions 
we are obligated to sustain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to under the revolving credit facility at any time when the aggregate unused capacity under the revolving credit facility is less than of the lesser of the revolving credit facility commitments and the borrowing base and for business days following the date upon which availability exceeds such threshold or during the continuation of an event of default 
at the end of fiscal  the company had unused borrowing capacity of million under the revolving credit facility and thus was not subject to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
our fixed charge coverage ratio was to at the end of fiscal despite not having financial maintenance covenants  our debt agreements contain certain negative covenants 
the failure to comply with these negative covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  effect acquisitions  enter into certain significant business combinations  make distributions or redeem indebtedness 
the term loan facility contains a negative covenant first lien secured leverage ratio covenant of to on a pro forma basis for a proposed transaction  such as an acquisition or incurrence of additional first lien debt 
our first lien secured leverage ratio was to at the end of fiscal a key financial metric utilized in the calculation of the first lien leverage ratio is adjusted ebitda as defined in the company s senior secured credit facilities 
the following table reconciles i our adjusted ebitda to net income under gaap and ii our adjusted free cash flow to cash flow from operating activities under gaap 
quarterly period ended fiscal september  adjusted ebitda net interest expense depreciation and amortization income tax expense business optimization and other expense restructuring and impairment extinguishment of debt pro forma acquisitions unrealized cost savings net income cash flow from operating activities net additions to property  plant and equipment adjusted free cash flow cash flow from investing activities cash flow from financing activities adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow  as presented in this document  are supplemental financial measures that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow are not gaap financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities  in each case determined in accordance with gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before depreciation and amortization  income tax expense benefit  interest expense net and certain restructuring and business optimization charges and as adjusted for unrealized cost reductions and acquired businesses  including unrealized synergies  which are more particularly defined in our credit documents and the indentures governing our notes 
adjusted ebitda is used by our lenders for debt covenant compliance purposes and by our management as one of several measures to evaluate management performance 
while the determination of appropriate adjustments in the calculation of adjusted ebitda is subject to interpretation under the terms of the credit facility  management believes the adjustments described above are in accordance with the covenants in the credit facility 
adjusted ebitda eliminates certain charges that we believe do not reflect operations and underlying operational performance 
although we use adjusted ebitda as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business  the use of adjusted ebitda has important limitations  including that adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  or account for one time expenses and charges  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness  adjusted ebitda does not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes  adjusted ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization and  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations 
we define adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment 
we use adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity because it assists us in assessing our company s ability to fund its growth through its generation of cash 
we believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to an investor in evaluating our liquidity because adjusted free cash flow and similar measures are widely used by investors  securities analysts and other interested parties in our industry to measure a company s liquidity without regard to revenue and expense recognition  which can vary depending upon accounting methods 
although we use adjusted free cash flow as a liquidity measure to assess our ability to generate cash  the use of adjusted free cash flow has important limitations  including that adjusted free cash flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service principal payments on our indebtedness  and adjusted free cash flow removes the impact of accrual basis accounting on asset accounts and non debt liability accounts 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow may be calculated differently by other companies  including other companies in our industry  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
because of these limitations  you should consider adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow alongside other performance measures and liquidity measures  including operating income  various cash flow metrics  net income and our other gaap results 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet transactions our contractual cash obligations at the end of fiscal are summarized in the following table which does not give any effect to the tax receivable agreement and income taxes payable as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those commitments 
payments due by period as of the end of fiscal total year years years years long term debt  excluding capital leases capital leases a fixed interest rate payments b variable interest rate payments c operating leases funding of pension and other postretirement obligations d total contractual cash obligations a includes anticipated interest of million over the life of the capital leases 
b includes variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements 
c based on applicable interest rates in effect end of fiscal d pension and other postretirement contributions have been included in the above table for the next fiscal year 
the amount is the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans 
the assumptions used by the actuary in calculating the projection includes weighted average return on pension assets of approximately for fiscal the estimation may vary based on the actual return on our plan assets 
see note to the consolidated or combined financial statements of this form k for more information on these obligations 
cash flows from operating activities net cash from operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million of cash flows from operating activities for fiscal the change is primarily attributed to additional working capital used in fiscal due to higher raw material costs partially offset by improved operating performance and the settlement of an interest rate hedge for million 
net cash from operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million of cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal the change is primarily the result of improved profitability  excluding non cash charges 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the change is primarily as a result of a decline in acquisition activity partially offset by increased capital expenditures 
net cash used for investing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the change is primarily a result of higher expenditures to finance acquisitions in fiscal partially offset by higher capital expenditures in fiscal cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million of cash used for financing activities for fiscal this change is primarily attributed to proceeds from issuance of common stock and incremental term loan capital restructure  which we utilized to repurchase the senior subordinated notes  second priority senior secured floating rate notes  first priority senior secured floating rate notes  senior subordinated and first priority senior secured notes 
net cash used for financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million of cash provided by financing activities for fiscal this change is primarily attributed to the net cash used for repayment of the revolving line of credit in fiscal we expect to pay between million and million related to the tra through the payment range is based on the company assumptions using various items  including valuation analysis and current tax law 
payments under the tra are not conditioned upon the parties continued ownership of the company 
during fiscal  we made million of payments related to the tra with an additional million being paid in the first fiscal quarter of based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our short term liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
we base such belief on historical experience and the funds available under the senior secured credit facility 
in addition we believe that we have the business strategy and resources to generate free cash flow from operations in the long term 
we do not expect this free cash flow to be sufficient to cover all long term debt obligations and intend to refinance these obligations prior to maturity 
however  we cannot predict our future results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risk factors section in this form k 
in particular  increases in the cost of resin which we are unable to pass through to our customers on a timely basis or significant acquisitions could severely impact our liquidity 
at the end of fiscal  our cash balance was million  and we had unused borrowing capacity of million under our revolving line of credit 
critical accounting policies and estimates we disclose those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining the amounts to be utilized for communicating our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the first note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results are likely to differ from these estimates  but management does not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical because they have the greatest impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer either when the products reach the free on board shipping point or destination depending on the contractual terms  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
accrued rebates 
we offer various rebates to our customers in exchange for their purchases 
these rebate programs are individually negotiated with our customers and contain a variety of different terms and conditions 
certain rebates are calculated as flat percentages of purchases  while others include tiered volume incentives 
these rebates may be payable monthly  quarterly  or annually 
the calculation of the accrued rebate balance involves significant management estimates  especially where the terms of the rebate involve tiered volume levels that require estimates of expected annual sales 
these provisions are based on estimates derived from current program requirements and historical experience 
we use all available information when calculating these reserves 
our accrual for customer rebates was million and million as of the end of fiscal and  respectively 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the guidance from the fasb for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
we recognized non cash asset impairment of long lived assets of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less that the carrying amount 
if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount  we evaluate goodwill using a two step impairment test 
otherwise  we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the two step impairment test 
we conduct our business through four operating segments  rigid open top  rigid closed top collectively rigid packaging  engineered materials and flexible packaging 
for purposes of conducting our annual goodwill impairment test  we have determined that we have five reporting units  rigid open top  rigid closed top  engineered materials  flexible packaging and tapes 
engineered materials and tapes operations comprise engineered materials operating segment 
we determined that each of the components within our respective reporting units have similar economic characteristics and therefore should be aggregated and tested at the respective level as one reporting unit 
we reached this conclusion because within each of our reporting units  we have similar products and production processes which allow us to share assets and resources across the product lines 
we regularly re align our production equipment and manufacturing facilities in order to take advantage of cost savings opportunities  obtain synergies and create manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  we utilize our research and development centers  design center  tool shops  and graphics center which all provide benefits to each of the reporting units and work on new products that can not only benefit one product line  but can benefit multiple product lines 
we also believe that the goodwill is recoverable from the overall operations of the unit given the similarity in production processes  synergies from leveraging the combined resources  common raw materials  common research and development  similar margins and similar distribution methodologies 
there were no indicators of impairment in the fourth quarter that required us to perform a test for the recoverability of goodwill 
in conducting a qualitative assessment  the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit  including  but not limited to the results of prior quantitative tests performed  changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit  actual and projected operating results  primarily focused on revenue growth trends and earnings  relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies  industry outlooks  macroeconomic conditions  liquidity  changes in key personnel  and the company s competitive position 
significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the qualitative assessment concludes that the two step impairment test is necessary  we first compare the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value 
the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis  also known as the income approach  and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for berry plastics to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
based on the favorable results of the qualitative assessment conducted on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter  there was no goodwill impairment charge recorded in goodwill as of september   by reporting unit is as follows goodwill as of september  rigid open top rigid closed top engineered films tapes flexible packaging based on our estimated evaluation of the events and factors outlined above for each of our reporting units  we believe that the value of each of our reporting units is either equal to or higher than last year as supported by the growth in our overall market capitalization and total enterprise value 
further  in connection with our initial public offering  we are required to make payments to our former shareholders of cash savings we generate from use of our tax assets that existed prior to our initial public offering 
the allocation of this obligation to each of the reporting units reduced the carrying value of each unit in the current year 
further  each of our reporting units experienced growth in the market multiples used to value the respective reporting unit based on the overall growth of our market capitalization and that of our competitors and peers 
our closed top  engineered films and tapes reporting units have all seen sales growth consistent with or in excess of our forecasts 
further  earnings have increased as seen in our overall operating results for the company as more fully described in our management discussion and analysis 
our rigid open top reporting unit has seen a decline in the current year related to some volume losses  selling price to raw material declines and manufacturing performance issues 
these declines in operating performance have been offset by the development and launch of the company s versalite product which will generate future revenues which were not contemplated in historical forecasts for the reporting unit 
further  the company has undertaken certain restructuring activities which will consolidate facilities and reduce costs which will benefit long term cash flows from this reporting unit 
finally  the market multiples for the rigid open top peers continue to be strong which continues to support that the historical valuations for this reporting unit are still substantially in excess of the carrying value 
finally  the flexible packaging reporting unit saw the strongest growth in market multiples across their peer group leading to implied higher valuations 
the company has experienced lower sales and earnings estimates than originally forecast but given the capital expenditure investments believes that earnings potential exists in this reporting unit 
given the overall growth in our market capitalization since our initial public offering  we believe that this supports that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is more than their carrying value 
we also performed our annual impairment test for fiscal of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which relates to our rigid packaging business 
the cash flow assumptions  growth rates and risks to these cash flows are similar to those used in our analysis to determine the fair value of our combined rigid packaging businesses 
the annual impairment test did not result in any impairment as the fair value exceeded the carrying value 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates 
we estimate the effective tax rates etr and associated liabilities or assets for each of our legal entities of ours in accordance with authoritative guidance 
we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording etrs and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the etr that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim periods etrs to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the etr  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
in multiple foreign jurisdictions  the company believes that it will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the related tax benefits 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its foreign net operating losses included within the deferred tax assets in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
the company has not provided a valuation allowance on its federal net operating losses in the united states because it has determined that future reversals of its temporary taxable differences will occur in the same periods and are of the same nature as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
changes in our valuation allowance could also impact our tra obligation 
our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million and million as of the end of fiscal and  respectively 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
this is not to suggest that other risk factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in material costs  our ability to pass through changes in material costs  and others could not materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our senior secured credit facilities 
our senior secured credit facilities are comprised of i billion of term loans and ii a million revolving credit facility 
at september   the company had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
the net outstanding balance of the term loans was billion at september  borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest  at our option  at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor rate for a one  two  three or six month interest period  or a nine or twelve month period  if available to all relevant lenders  in each case  plus an applicable margin 
a change in libor would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
in november  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap transactions to protect billion of the outstanding variable rate term loan debt from future interest rate volatility 
the first agreement had a notional amount of million and became effective in november the agreement swaps three month variable libor contracts for a fixed three year rate of and expires in november the second agreement had a notional amount of million and became effective in december the agreement swaps three month variable libor contracts for a fixed three year rate of and expires in november the counterparties to these agreements are with global financial institutions 
in august  the company began utilizing month libor contracts for the underlying senior secured credit facility 
the company s change in interest rate selection caused the company to lose hedge accounting on both of the interest rate swaps 
the company recorded subsequent changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations and will amortize the unrealized losses to interest expense through the end of the respective swap agreements 
a 
change in libor would not have a material impact on the fair value of the interest rate swaps 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction to manage cash flow variability associated with billion of outstanding variable rate term loan debt 
the agreement swapped the greater of a three month variable libor contract or for a fixed three year rate of  with an effective date in may and expiration in may in june  the company elected to settle this derivative instrument and received million as a result of this settlement 
the offset is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and deferred income taxes and will be amortized to interest expense from may through may  the original term of the swap agreement 
resin cost sensitivity we are exposed to market risk from changes in plastic resin prices that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our plastic resin purchasing strategy is to deal with only high quality  dependable suppliers 
we believe that we have maintained strong relationships with these key suppliers and expect that such relationships will continue into the foreseeable future 
the resin market is a global market and  based on our experience  we believe that adequate quantities of plastic resins will be available at market prices  but we can give you no assurances as to such availability or the prices thereof 
if the price of resin increased or decreased by this would result in a material change to our cost of goods sold
