item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of global print management and promotional solutions to corporate clients across a wide range of industries 
with proprietary technology  an extensive supplier network and deep domain expertise  the company procures  manages and delivers printed materials and promotional products as part of a comprehensive outsourced enterprise solution 
our technology is designed to capitalize on excess manufacturing capacity and other inefficiencies in the traditional print supply chain to obtain favorable pricing and to deliver high quality products and services for our clients 
our proprietary software applications and database create a fully integrated solution that stores  analyzes and tracks the production capabilities of our supplier network  as well as quote and price data for each bid we receive and print job we execute 
as a result  we have one of the largest independent repositories of equipment profiles and price data for print suppliers in the united states 
we leverage our technology to match each print job with the supplier that is optimally suited to meet the client s needs at a highly competitive price 
our production managers use our proprietary technology to manage the print procurement process from end to end 
through our network of more than  global suppliers  we offer a full range of print  fulfillment and logistics services that allows us to procure printed products on virtually any substrate 
the breadth of our product offerings and services and the depth of our supplier network enable us to fulfill all of the print procurement needs of our clients 
by leveraging our technology platform  our clients are able to reduce overhead costs  redeploy internal resources and obtain favorable pricing and service terms 
in addition  our ability to track individual transactions and provide customized reports detailing print procurement activity on an enterprise wide basis provides our clients with greater visibility and control of their print expenditures 
since  we have expanded from a regional focus to a national and now global focus with the acquisitions of cpro  a leading provider of print solutions in latin america  and productions graphics  a leading print management firm with a particular strength in continental europe  in we operate in global office locations 
we organize our operations into two segments based on geographic regions north america and international 
the north america segment includes operations in the united states and canada  and the international segment includes operations in the united kingdom  continental europe  the middle east  latin america and asia 
in  we generated revenue from third parties of million in the north america segment and million in the international segment 
we believe the opportunity exists to expand our business into new geographic markets 
our objective is to continue to increase our sales in the major print markets in the united states and internationally 
we intend to hire or acquire more account executives within close proximity to these large markets 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale of printed products to our clients 
our annual revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of and in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and middle market 
enterprise clients usually order printed products in higher dollar amounts and volume than our middle market clients 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of printing services on a recurring basis  if the client has signed an open ended purchase order  or a series of related purchase orders  or if the client has enrolled in our e stores program  which enables the client to make online purchases of printing services on a recurring basis 
we categorize all other clients as middle market 
we enter into contracts with our enterprise clients to provide some or a specific portion of their printed products on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients are generally three to five years  subject to termination by either party upon prior notice ranging from days to twelve months 
several of our enterprise clients have outsourced substantially all of their recurring print needs to us 
we provide printed products to our middle market clients on an order by order basis 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  while middle market clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
our revenue consists of the prices paid by our clients for printed products 
these prices  in turn  reflect the amounts charged to us by our suppliers plus our gross profit 
our gross profit margin  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is fixed by contract or  in the case of middle market clients  is dependent on prices negotiated on a job by job basis 
once either type of client accepts our pricing terms  the selling price is established and we procure the product for our own account in order to re sell it to the client 
we take full title and risk of loss for the product upon shipment 
the finished product is typically shipped directly from our supplier to a destination specified by our client 
upon shipment  our supplier invoices us for its production costs and we invoice our client 
our revenue from enterprise clients tends to generate lower gross profit margins than our revenue from middle market clients because the gross profit margins established in our contracts with large enterprise clients are generally lower than the gross profit margins typically realized in our middle market business 
although our enterprise revenue generates lower gross profit margins  our enterprise business tends to be as profitable as our middle market business on an operating profit basis because the commission expense associated with enterprise clients is generally lower 
cost of goods sold and gross profit our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the price at which we purchase products from our suppliers 
our selling price  including our gross profit  in the case of some of our enterprise clients  is based on a fixed gross margin established by contract or  in the case of middle market clients  is determined at the discretion of the account executive or production manager within predetermined parameters 
our gross margins on our enterprise clients are typically lower than our gross margins on our middle market clients 
as a result  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for our enterprise clients is typically higher than those for our middle market clients 
our gross profit for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
operating expenses and income from operations our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of commissions paid to our account executives  compensation costs for our management team and production managers as well as compensation costs for our finance and support employees  public company expenses  and corporate systems  legal and accounting  facilities and travel and entertainment expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
we accrue for commissions when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our account executives receive a monthly draw to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
the cash paid to our account executives in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our account executives earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our prepaid commission balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we agree to provide our clients with printed products that conform to the industry standard of a commercially reasonable quality  and our suppliers in turn agree to provide us with products of the same quality 
in addition  the quotes we execute with our clients include customary industry terms and conditions that limit the amount of our liability for product defects 
product defects have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are required to make payment to our suppliers for completed print jobs regardless of whether our clients make payment to us 
our bad debt expense was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our income from operations for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon meeting all of the following revenue recognition criteria  which is typically met upon shipment or delivery of our products to customers i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists through our customer contracts  ii the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership which occurs at shipment  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable as evidenced by customer contracts  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
unbilled revenue relates to shipments that have been made to customers for which the related account receivable has not yet been billed 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition principal agent considerations  we account for all of our revenue that meet the following criteria on a gross basis i we are the primary obligor in the arrangement  ii we have general inventory risk before the customer order is placed and upon customer return  iii we have latitude in establishing price  iv we have discretion in supplier selection from our existing network  and v we have credit risk with customer payments 
accordingly  all revenue billed to customers which meets these criteria is classified as revenue and all corresponding supplier payments are classified as cost of goods sold 
we recognize revenue for services provided to our customers which may be delivered in conjunction with the procurement of printed materials at the time when delivery and customer acceptance occur and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue for services provided on a stand alone basis upon completion of the service 
service revenue has not been material to our overall revenue to date 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances and  based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
these estimates of balances that will not be collected are based on historical write offs and recoveries of accounts receivables 
the estimates of recovery can change based on actual experience and therefore can affect the level of reserves we place on existing accounts receivables 
fully reserved receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis and uncollectible accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted 
at december   the gross accounts receivable balance includes approximately of customer balances that are in excess of one year 
we believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
absent any interim indicators of impairment  we have elected to test for goodwill impairment as of december of each year 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if the quantitative test is required  in the first step  the fair value for each reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the case that the fair value is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value of the goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
we define our two reporting units as north america and international 
the provisions of asu were adopted in the fourth quarter of based on the qualitative factors assessed  we concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the north america reporting unit is less than its carrying amount primarily because our overall financial performance has been positive in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating income and cash flows generated by the north america reporting unit appear sufficient to support the book value of its net assets 
however  due to economic factors internationally  it was determined that the quantitative test was necessary for the international reporting unit 
no impairment was identified as a result of this test 
intangible assets other than goodwill acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value 
we review each business acquisition to identify intangible assets other than goodwill acquired  which include customer lists  non competition agreements  patents  trade names and trademarks 
our significant acquired intangible assets subject to estimation of fair value primarily include acquired customer lists 
for customer list assets  the nature of the customer relationships makes an estimation of the reproduction or replacement costs highly subjective 
as there is a specific earnings stream that can be associated exclusively with the customer relationships  we believe that the discounted cash flow method is the most appropriate valuation methodology to determine the fair value of the customer relationships 
asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators exist 
our intangible assets consist of customer lists  trade names  noncompete agreements and patents 
our customer lists are being amortized using the economic useful life method over their estimated weighted average useful lives of approximately years 
our noncompete agreements  trade names and patents are being amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives 
as of december   the net balance of our intangible assets was million 
contingent purchase consideration in connection with certain of the company s business acquisitions accounted for under asc  contingent purchase consideration is payable in cash or stock upon the achievement of certain performance measures over future periods 
for these acquisitions  the company has estimated and recorded the fair value of the purchase consideration obligation  whereby fair value is determined based on the present value of the potential contingent purchase price 
the company has recorded  and  in contingent purchase consideration obligation at december  and  respectively 
changes in estimated fair value of the contingent purchase consideration obligation are recorded in the company s results from operations 
adjustments to the estimated fair value of the contingent purchase consideration are based on estimates of probability of achievement of earnings targets based on actual results and forecasts of the earnings of the companies acquired 
these forecast estimates can change based on macroeconomic conditions as well as the overall success of the business in retaining existing business and gaining new business 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation awards in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
compensation expense is measured by determining the fair value using the black scholes option valuation model and is then recognized over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis for the entire award 
this valuation model requires assumptions  which impact the assumed fair value  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  expected volatility of the company stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
expected term is estimated based on historical experience related to similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we believe that historical experience provides the best estimate of future expected life 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected term 
stock based compensation cost recognized during the period is based on the portion of the share based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost recognized has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in  we recorded  of additional stock based compensation expense for awards which exceeded the expense recorded using estimated forfeiture rates 
the company recorded million  million and million in compensation expense related to stock based compensation  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in connection with the purchase of corevision  inc in september  we acquired  in net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in at december    of losses remain outstanding for future use 
in connection with the purchase of marketing out of the box in july  we acquired  in net operating loss carryforwards that will expire in at december    of losses remain outstanding for future use 
in connection with the purchase of cpro services ltd  in january  we acquired  in net operating loss carryforwards that will never expire 
at december    of losses remain outstanding for future use in chile 
no valuation allowance on our net operating loss carryforwards is considered necessary as the amounts are more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of certain realization requirements of asc  we have not recorded certain deferred tax assets that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation that are greater than the compensation recognized for financial reporting 
as of december   we have  in tax deductions related to these stock option exercises which have not been recorded but are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
these deductions will be recorded to additional paid in capital in the period in which they are realized

although we can provide no assurances  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and the million available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
we do not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds  however  should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally or through debt or equity issuances  we could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions 
if foreign earnings were to be remitted to the us  foreign tax credits would be available to reduce any us tax due upon repatriation

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb amended its standard on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting standard requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this new standard are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  while the new standard changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of and have elected to present the components of comprehensive income in separate but continuous statements for the years ended december   and in february  the fasb issued asu which requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
these requirements are effective for public companies for reporting periods beginning after december  we will include the required disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of in september  the fasb amended its standards related to goodwill impairment testing with the objective being to simplify the annual goodwill impairment process by allowing entities to use qualitative factors first before performing the traditional two step goodwill impairment test 
the two step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
because the measurement of a potential impairment has not changed  the standard will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
for the impairment test  we elected to perform the qualitative analysis over the north america reporting unit 
the quantitative test was performed over the international reporting unit 
no impairment charges were recognized in see note summary of significant accounting policies for further discussion of these impairment tests 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are dependent upon the availability of paper  and paper prices represent a substantial portion of the cost of our products 
the supply and price of paper depend on a variety of factors over which we have no control  including environmental and conservation regulations  natural disasters and weather 
we believe a increase in the price of paper would not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated statements of income or cash flows  as these costs are generally passed through to our clients 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
interest is payable at the adjusted libor rate or the alternate base rate 
assuming our million revolving credit facility was fully drawn  a increase in the interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by million 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  in particular because all of our investments are in cash equivalents 
the average duration of all of our investments as of december  was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  british pound sterling  peruvian nuevo sol  colombian peso  and chilean peso  which exposes us to foreign currency risk 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from international customers  and we expect the percentage of revenue derived from outside the united states to increase in future periods as we continue to expand globally 
revenue and related expenses generated from our international operations are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding country 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these markets is generally the same as the corresponding local currency 
the results of operations of  and certain of our intercompany balances associated with  our international operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in exchange rates could negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 
we may record significant gains or losses on the re measurement of intercompany balances 
foreign exchange gains and losses recorded to date have been immaterial to our financial results 
at this time we do not  but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
it is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations
