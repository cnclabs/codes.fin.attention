table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research  development and commercialization of innovative therapies in pulmonology and orphan fibrotic diseases 
we have an advanced stage product candidate in pulmonology  pirfenidone  that was granted marketing authorization effective february in all member countries of the european union eu for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf 
for information relating to our business and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business esbriet pirfenidone pirfenidone is an orally active  small molecule compound under development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in september  we launched commercial sales of pirfenidone in germany under the trade name esbriet  and esbriet is now also commercially available in austria  belgium  denmark  france  iceland  luxembourg  norway and sweden 
in addition  on january   we began the commercial launch of esbriet in canada 
in addition  we continue to prepare for the commercial launch of esbriet in the other countries in the eu 
specifically  in italy  we just recently concluded pricing and reimbursement discussions with the italian medicines agency aifa and we expect to promptly announce the details of these discussions in the first quarter of with respect to spain  considering a royal decree introduced in affecting health care expenditures and pharmaceuticals and the continuing economic challenges of the country  we currently anticipate that a decision regarding pricing and reimbursement of esbriet will occur in the first half of in the uk  the review of esbriet by the national institute for clinical excellence nice is expected to conclude in march nice s preliminary assessment of esbriet was unsupportive of esbriet reimbursement and we are addressing various outstanding issues in preparation for the march meeting 
if nice decides to support the reimbursement of esbriet  we currently expect to launch esbriet as soon as possible with a target to complete the launch in the second quarter of in addition to launches in these remaining so called top eu countries italy  spain and the uk  we expect to launch esbriet in the netherlands  finland and ireland in the first half of assuming that acceptable pricing and reimbursement conditions are negotiated in these countries 
to support our commercialization efforts of esbriet in europe  we have invested significantly and continue to invest in the establishment of a commercial infrastructure within europe  including an increase to our employee headcount in that region 
on december   we announced several additions to our senior leadership team in support of our commercialization efforts as well as announcing the establishment of our european headquarters in reinach  switzerland  subsequently moved to muttenz  switzerland in early in december  we transferred all of our non us rights to research  develop and commercialize pirfenidone for ipf to our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  intermune international ag 
based on our current intellectual property portfolio  we expect to have exclusive rights to sell pirfenidone within the european union through in july  we initiated a new phase clinical study to evaluate pirfenidone in ipf known as ascend in an effort to support approval of pirfenidone for the treatment ipf in the united states 
we achieved the full enrollment target of randomized patients for our ascend trial in december and we currently expect top line results from ascend in the second quarter of concurrent public offerings and note repurchases in january  we completed a registered underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock company stock offering and a concurrent registered underwritten public offering of 
table of contents million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due convertible note offering 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated expenses 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds from the convertible note offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated expenses 
in january  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the convertible note offering to repurchase approximately million of our outstanding convertible senior notes due the notes 
following such repurchases  approximately million of the notes remain outstanding 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the convertible note offering and  if necessary a portion of the net proceeds from the common stock offering to repay at maturity or earlier repurchase some or all of such remaining notes 
we further intend to use the net proceeds from the common stock offering and any remaining proceeds from the convertible note offering to fund the commercialization of esbriet  to fund our ascend trial and for general corporate purposes  which may include funding research and development and increasing working capital 
agreement with shionogi in february  we reached an agreement on the material terms of a settlement with shionogi relating to a complaint shionogi filed against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california in july shionogi s complaint alleged principally that we breached that agreement with shionogi governing the exchange and use of certain documents and information relating to the parties respective clinical trials of pirfenidone 
the principal terms that the parties have agreed to include i dismissal of the litigation with prejudice  ii a royalty payment from us to shionogi on net sales of esbriet pirfenidone in the eu of for sales commencing on january  and ending on the date of the expiration of orphan drug status in the eu february  iii no royalty payments on net sales of esbriet in the eu prior to january   iv no royalty payments on sales of esbriet in canada  v no royalty payments on sales of esbriet in the us or sales in any other jurisdiction other than the eu  unless we submit certain shionogi clinical information in connection with an application for regulatory approval in that jurisdiction  and vi the shionogi clinical information in our current nda in the us would not trigger payment of a royalty on sales of esbriet in the us we expect to promptly enter into a complete settlement agreement 
sale of actimmune rights to vidara on may   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with vidara therapeutics international limited  an irish company  vidara therapeutics holdings llc  a delaware limited liability company and vidara therapeutics research limited  an irish company collectively  vidara whereby we agreed to sell to vidara all of our worldwide development and commercialization rights to actimmune for million in cash  plus certain conditional royalty payments for a period of two years following the closing 
the divestiture of our rights to actimmune was completed on june  the assets purchased by vidara included certain inventory  assumed contracts  regulatory approvals  promotional materials  records and intellectual property in each case  related to actimmune 
in connection with the divestiture  vidara assumed certain of our liabilities and obligations arising out of or related to the assumed contracts and actimmune 
sale of danoprevir rights to roche in october  we sold our worldwide development and commercialization rights in danoprevir to roche for million in cash 
in connection with this transaction  the collaboration agreement that we and roche entered into in october was terminated 
roche has agreed to reimburse us for royalty and milestone obligations that we continue to have to novartis corporation and array related to danoprevir 
significant licenses and agreements we are highly dependent on technology that we have licensed or acquired from third parties 
effective november  we entered into asset purchase agreements with marnac and kdl whereby we effectively 
table of contents terminated our prior license agreement with them by purchasing  among other things  the pirfenidone related assets covered by such prior license agreement and as a result no longer have milestone or royalty obligations thereunder to marnac and kdl 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreements  we are required to make future milestone payments in connection with the continued development and regulatory approval of pirfenidone in certain countries 
the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license  collaboration and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we paid million in march in connection with our decision to proceed with regulatory approval for pirfenidone and an additional million in connection with our clinical progress of danoprevir 
we may be required to make future contingent milestone payments to the owners of our licensed products or the suppliers of our drug compounds in accordance with our license  commercialization and collaboration agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the remaining milestones per the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
of the remaining million in aggregate milestone payments  million in contingent payments would be made by us only if positive phase data and product approval in the united states is achieved for pirfenidone 
included in the million in future aggregate milestone payments are aggregate milestone payments of million payable to array and novartis  of which roche has agreed to reimburse us in connection with our sale of danoprevir to roche 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation and use of estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 
in preparing the financial statements  management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of intermune  inc and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated 

table of contents all tabular disclosures of dollar amounts are presented in thousands 
all per share amounts are presented at their actual amounts 
percentages and amounts presented herein may not calculate or sum precisely due to rounding 
available for sale investments we determine the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
we classify all investments with maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase as short term investments as they are subject to use within one year in current operations 
we make investments based on specific guidelines approved by our board of directors with a view to liquidity and capital preservation and regularly review our investments for performance 
as of december    all our investments have been classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
any unrealized losses which are determined to be other than temporary will be included in earnings 
realized gains and losses are recognized on the specific identification method 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the investments can be difficult and subjective 
us gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
valuation of level and instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
we do not currently hold any investments that would be classified as level investments 
we periodically evaluate our investments for impairment 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
in order to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate many factors  including the following the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  our financial condition and business outlook  including key operational and cash flow metrics  current market conditions and future trends in the industry  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the fair value of an investment exists 
changes in our assessment of the valuation of our investments could materially impact our future operating results and financial position 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
if all of the remaining and outstanding restricted stock awards that were granted in the past four years beginning in became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 

table of contents revenue recognition and revenue reserves we recognize revenue from product sales generally upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer and record provisions for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts against revenue 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we believe that we are able to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts based on historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and believe that our reserves are adequate 
we include shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold 
our european revenue from sales of esbriet began in september and through december   substantially all of which has been driven by revenue derived from sales in germany 
we only ship product upon receipt of valid orders from customers such as pharmacies and hospitals which are in turn a result of actual patient prescriptions 
pursuant to the company s terms and conditions of sale in germany  a customer has no right to return the product 
such restriction on product returns is common practice for german companies  and as a result  product returns have been primarily limited to damaged goods since our commercial launch in germany 
therefore  we have not established a reserve for product returns  though we have established a reserve for the mandatory rebate as allowed under the applicable german health care regulations 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
in december  we entered into a new agreement with roche that focused on research to identify and develop next generation protease inhibitors for the treatment of hepatitis c virus 
under the terms of the agreement  roche funded all research costs related to the programs for the period from july  through june   the effective term of the research program 
during  we received million from roche as a reimbursement for research services performed which has been recorded as collaboration revenue and in february  roche terminated the agreement without taking a license to any compounds resulting from the research program 
consequently  we will not be receiving any development or commercialization milestones or royalties from roche under the agreement 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined using the specific identification method which approximates first in first out 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the 
table of contents long lead times required to manufacture our products 
inventories were million and million at december  and december   respectively consisting entirely of esbriet at december  and consisting of million of esbriet and million of actimmune at december  because of the long lead times required to manufacture esbriet  we enter into purchase obligations to satisfy our estimated inventory requirements 
we evaluate the need to provide reserves for contractually committed future purchases of inventory that may be in excess of forecasted future demand 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current as well as committed purchases 
we are also required to make judgments as to the expiration dates since the products are not usable beyond their expiration date 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for esbriet  we also consider the expiration dates of future manufactured quantities under these purchase obligations 
we incurred approximately million for inventory writedowns during the year ended december  we did not have any inventory write downs during the year ended results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million 
this compares to million and million of total revenue for the same periods in and  respectively 
revenue for the year ended december  and consists solely of esbriet product sales  primarily in germany  following the launch in that country in september for the year ended december   revenue consisted of million of esbriet product sales and million of collaboration revenue for the remaining reimbursement for research services under the roche agreement  which has since been terminated 
revenue for the year ended december  consists of the sale of our worldwide rights in danoprevir to roche in october  which resulted in the recognition of million in collaboration revenue from the sale proceeds along with the acceleration of million of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of our collaboration agreement with roche 
in addition  revenue consists of collaboration revenue of approximately million related to the new collaboration agreement we entered into with roche in december  and million of amortization of the aggregate million in upfront payments received from roche in and cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes product manufacturing costs  royalties  distribution costs and inventory write downs 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in cost of goods sold relates solely to esbriet product sales  following the launch in september gross margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for the year ended december  compared with the same period in is primarily due to economies of scale achieved from increased sales 
for example  in connection with our receipt of authorization to market esbriet in the european union  we made a milestone payment of million and have capitalized such payment as acquired product rights 
this asset is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the estimated useful life of esbriet and we incurred approximately million and million of amortization expense in and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing an increase of in over and an increase in from the increase in r d expenses over is primarily related to the on going ascend clinical trials in the us  which were initiated in july the increase in r d 
table of contents expenses as compared to is primarily due to the preparation and initiation of the ascend trial and an increase in stock compensation expense of approximately million for equity awards related to the european commission s decision to grant marketing authorization for esbriet  partially offset by decreased expenses associated with a discontinuation of investment in the hcv portfolio following the divestiture of danoprevir in october of and completion of our research agreement with roche in june based on current budgeted programs  r d expense is expected to be in a range of million to million in the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million  million  and million of stock based compensation expense in  and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology programs non specific total effective in  we discontinued our hcv development program 
historically  a large component of our total operating expense was our ongoing investment in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
currently  the largest component of our research and development expense relates to our ascend trial to support approval of pirfenidone for the treatment ipf in the united states for which targeted enrollment is complete 
in addition  we consider  and in the future may be required to complete  additional clinical studies with regard to pirfenidone in isolation or in combination with other treatment alternatives 
we do not currently have any other product candidates in clinical development  however  we maintain a pre clinical program and research development pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and overall safety and efficacy profile as ultimately decided upon by the fda 
due to these factors  we believe it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash 
table of contents inflows from these programs 
in addition  due to these same factors and others  we are unable to reasonably estimate the efforts needed and  therefore  the costs we will incur to complete any of our projects or the estimated time to complete such projects 
milestone payments to third parties we made no third party payments in  or related to contractual milestone obligations that were charged directly to expense 
in march  we received authorization to market esbriet in the eu and made a milestone payment of million in the aggregate to marnac and kdl and have capitalized such payment as acquired product rights 
this asset is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the estimated useful life of esbriet and we incurred approximately million and million of amortization expense in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
the increased spending for the years ended december  and compared with the previous year is attributed to the creation of our european infrastructure and investments in the pre launch and commercial launch of esbriet in europe  including but not limited to additional headcount 
the increase for the year ended december  was partially offset by a decrease in legal costs in connection with the global prosecution of our intellectual property portfolio  other regulatory and corporate matters  as well as expenses in connection with indemnification obligations to our former ceo 
based on current budgeted programs  sg a expense is expected to be in a range of million to million in restructuring charges following our receipt of the complete response letter from the fda requesting an additional clinical trial to support the efficacy of pirfenidone  we initiated a reduction in force in may resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately million during  consisting primarily of severance and benefits payments made to terminated employees 
interest income interest income was approximately million for each of the years ended december   and the slight differences year to year in interest income reflects the modest yields on our cash and short term investments resulting from our conservative investment portfolio 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  over was the result of our issuance in september of million aggregate principal of convertible senior notes due the decrease in interest expense in compared with reflects a decline in the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes due and converted on march  as a result of the conversion  debt discount amortization was approximately million in  compared to million recorded in other income expense other income expense was an expense of million and million for the years ended december  and compared to income of million for the year ended december  other expense in 
table of contents and consisted primarily of currency losses related to the unhedged portion of our non dollar denominated balance sheet exposures in connection with our european expansion 
the decrease in exchange losses for the year ended december  reflects the results of our balance sheet hedging program which we initiated in the fourth quarter of other income in consisted primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of all of our remaining auction rate securities and includes approximately million related to the receipt of a federal research and development grant in the fourth quarter of pursuant to the federal qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp  partially offset by other expenses 
provision for income taxes due to the intra period tax allocation rules associated with our discontinued operations  we recorded million and million of income tax benefit for the years ended december  and  respectively  in relation to our continuing operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded no income tax benefit 
we also recorded million and million of income tax expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  in relation to our discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of income tax expense 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year and federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that begin to expire in and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
in general  section of the internal revenue code irc of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  other tax carryforwards and certain built in losses  as defined under that section  upon an ownership change 
the most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed in due to irc section and limitations  we only account for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as deferred tax assets where we reasonably expect that these losses and carryforwards can be utilized in future periods 
subsequent to the completion of the analysis  we became aware that certain of our stockholders have changed their stock holdings  most notably during the public offering of our stock in january see note 
we will update our irc section historical ownership changes analysis for such changes in stock holdings in order to determine the impact on our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in in accordance with asc  we recorded a deferred charge during the year ended december  related to the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of our non us economic rights to esbriet to intermune international ag  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in the deferred charge is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the estimated life of the intellectual property 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic no 
 previously referred to as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  implementation of asc topic no 
did not result in any adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations or a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  in january  we completed a registered underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock and a concurrent registered underwritten public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the aggregate net proceeds from our concurrent offerings were approximately million 
in january  we used a 
table of contents portion of the net proceeds from the convertible note offering to repurchase approximately million of our outstanding notes 
following these repurchases  approximately million of the notes remain outstanding 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the convertible note offering and  if necessary a portion of the net proceeds from the common stock offering to repay at maturity or earlier repurchase some or all of such remaining notes 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  including the remaining net proceeds from these offerings  to fund the commercialization of esbriet  to fund our ascend trial and for general corporate purposes 
certain of our available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our core operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  at any point in time we could have balances that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis  these cash balances could be impacted and we may be unable to access our cash if the underlying financial institutions fail or if we become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced a lack of access to cash in any of our third party financial institution accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
beginning in february  auctions failed for our entire portfolio of auction rate securities which had substantially limited the liquidity of those instruments 
however  in  we sold or redeemed our remaining portfolio of auction rate securities 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million  as shown on the consolidated statement of operations  as well as changes to our working capital 
significant changes in working capital consisted of increases in accounts receivable and product inventory principally related to the initial launch of esbriet in germany in september additionally  accounts payable  accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities increased as a result of significant increases in headcount in europe and the initiation of the ascend clinical trial in the us in mid investing activities cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  comprised primarily of proceeds from the divestiture of actimmune  as well as sales and maturities of available for sale securities of million  partially offset by purchase of million of available for sale securities 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  was due the issuance of stock to our employees under our employee benefit plans 
also see above concurrent public offerings and note repurchases for information related to our concurrent registered underwritten public offering completed in january of common stock and convertible senior notes due the resulting aggregate net proceeds from the common stock offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated expenses 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds from the convertible note offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated expenses 

table of contents we expect to incur net losses in the near term as we continue our commercialization and commercial launch activities of esbriet in the european union  continue the development of pirfenidone for approval in the united states with the ongoing ascend study  continue our research in the area of orphan fibrotic diseases  and continue to grow our operational capabilities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of esbriet will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the next months 
this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to capital requirements related to our commercialization and commercial launch activities of esbriet for the european union jurisdictions  including the expansion of our commercial infrastructure and related personnel and facility expenses  the timing and financial requirements of the ongoing phase clinical study of pirfenidone in the us ascend  sales of esbriet or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  pricing and reimbursement from third payors for esbriet  our ability to partner our programs or products or enter into collaborative relationships with other companies  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the costs  timing and outcome of any current or future legal proceedings  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  and the timing and size of payments we may receive from potential collaboration agreements 
as a result  we may require substantial additional capital and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
furthermore  additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

we currently do not hedge our interest rate risk exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income

foreign currency market risk in connection with our continuing expansion efforts  we now conduct business throughout europe in several currencies  including the euro  swiss franc and british pound  among others 
therefore  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes  we enter into foreign currency contracts 
the company does not enter into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables and payables 
these derivatives are not 
table of contents designated as hedging instruments 
gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income expense and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the company s foreign exchange forward contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement 
the company does  however  seek to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions 
in addition  the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored 
management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties
