item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item of this annual report on form k  which include additional information about our accounting policies  practices and the transactions underlying our financial results 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business 
we apply our best judgment  our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience  as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances  such as current economic conditions  and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ from these estimates 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation  ball  the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage  food  personal care and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses  are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates  such as plastics and glass 
in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs  increasing prices  developing new products  expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions 
we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products mainly to large  multinational beverage  food  personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have a diversified customer base  we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the prc and south america  as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam 
the overall metal beverage and aerosol container industries are growing globally and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american market seeing a continued slight decline 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
we also have exposure to inflation  in particular the rising costs of raw materials  as well as other direct cost inputs 
we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in a majority of our packaging sales contracts to pass through metal price changes  as well as through the use of derivative instruments 
the pass through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact  if any  on net earnings 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss  insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss  and our long term relationships represent a known  stable customer base 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage of completion under the cost to cost method of accounting 
throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
the aerospace and technologies contract mix in consisted of approximately percent cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  and percent fixed price contracts 
the remainder represents time and material contracts  which typically provide for the sale of labor at fixed hourly rates 
the contracted backlog of approximately billion at december   consisted of approximately percent fixed price contracts 

table of contents corporate strategy our drive for vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long term success 
during and  we made progress on each of our drive for levers as described in the following maximizing value in our existing businesses through reducing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and the expansion of specialty container production to meet current demand  redeployment of surplus equipment to other global locations  closure of certain metal beverage facilities and relocating our european headquarters to zurich  switzerland  to gain business  customer and supplier efficiencies  expanding into new products and capabilities through expansion into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with the acquisitions of envases in december and aerocan in january  aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout the global network  broadening our geographic reach with the construction and start up of three beverage container manufacturing facilities in china  brazil and vietnam  and leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation and aerospace technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future 
the backlog in our aerospace business increased percent during to billion 
these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding and or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage  food  personal care  household products and aerospace customers 

table of contents results of operations consolidated sales and earnings years ended december  in millions net sales net earnings attributable to ball corporation net earnings attributable to ball corporation as a of consolidated net sales the increase in net sales in compared to was driven largely by higher sales in aerospace and higher beverage container sales volumes in certain geographical regions being offset by lower sales volumes in food and household containers and unfavorable currency translation effects in europe

table of contents other liquidity measures management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period  economic value added eva dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed  earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions  outlined in the following calculations below 
the following financial measurements are on a non us gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
non us gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to  or a substitute for  financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item of this annual report 
based on the above definitions  our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below years ended december  in millions earnings before taxes  as reported total interest expense earnings before interest and taxes ebit business consolidation and other activities comparable ebit our calculations of comparable ebitda  the comparable ebit to interest coverage ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below years ended december  in millions  except ratios comparable ebit as calculated above add depreciation and amortization comparable ebitda interest expense total debt at december  less cash and cash equivalents net debt comparable ebit interest expense x x x net debt comparable ebitda x x x 
table of contents our calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below years ended december  in millions  except per share amounts net earnings attributable to ball corporation  as reported discontinued operations  net of tax business consolidation and other activities  net of tax equity earnings and gains related to acquisitions  net of tax debt refinancing costs  net of tax net earnings attributable to ball corporation before above transactions comparable earnings per diluted share from continuing operations  as reported per diluted share comparable basis free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  to evaluate strategic investments  to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
based on the above definition  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows years ended december  in millions total cash provided by operating activities adjust for increase in accounts receivable due to change in accounting for securitization program capital expenditures  including discontinued operations free cash flow based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be in the range of million  capital expenditures to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the range of million 
in  we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases  dividend payments  growth capital projects and  to the extent available  acquisitions that meet our various criteria 
of the total estimated capital expenditures  approximately million was contractually committed as of december  
table of contents commitments cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases  purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including capital leases interest payments on long term debt b operating leases purchase obligations c total payments on contractual obligations a amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at year end exchange rates 
b for variable rate facilities  amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 
c the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
the table above does not include million of uncertain tax positions  the timing of which is unknown at this time 
contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  are expected to be in the range of million in  of which approximately million was contributed in january this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance  among other factors 
benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december  through  respectively  and a total of million for the years through payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between million million and million million in each of the years through and a total of million million for the years through for the us pension plans in  we revised our return on asset assumption to percent from percent in and our discount rate assumption to percent from percent in 
based on these changes in assumptions and revisions based on plan experience studies  us pension expense in is anticipated to be approximately million higher than in a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated million increase in the global pension expense  while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated million of additional pension expense in additional information regarding the company s pension plans is provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this annual report 
due to the us tax status of certain of ball s subsidiaries in canada and the prc  the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries  net of any estimated foreign tax credits 
in  ball increased its economic interest in its brazilian joint venture  and due to the nature of the investment  ball provides deferred taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of the brazil investment related to this incremental investment 
net us taxes provided for brazil  canada and prc earnings in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the foreseeable future  anticipated cash flow from the us operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs  including capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases and debt service  including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years 
should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events  ball can access funds in the us to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility  from public bond markets  from cash deposits in the prc on earnings for which us taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding us loans to foreign subsidiaries 
consequently  management s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball s remaining foreign investments and  as a result  no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made 
it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings  however  repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 
commodity price risk aluminum we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods 
first  we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing 
second  we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 
steel most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices 
we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in considering the effects of derivative instruments  the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  the company has currency exposures on raw materials  and the effect of a percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we may use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps  which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 

table of contents based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next months and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts 
in addition  at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies  and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s net earnings 
our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of selling our products in local currency  purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not an exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   currency exposures and currency exposures from the purchase and sale of raw materials  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
common stock price risk the company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and  accordingly  is marked to fair value using the company s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period 
based on current share levels in the program  each change in the company s stock price has an impact of million on pretax earnings 
during march and september  the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the company s exposure to these fair value fluctuations  which were renewed in january and july and will be outstanding until march and september  respectively 
the swaps have a notional value of million shares and  shares  respectively
