our business general the coca cola company is the world largest beverage company 
we own or license and market more than nonalcoholic beverage brands  primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters  enhanced waters  juices and juice drinks  ready to drink teas and coffees  and energy and sports drinks

finished beverage products bearing our trademarks  sold in the united states since  are now sold in more than countries 
we make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as independent bottling partners  distributors  wholesalers and retailers the world largest beverage distribution system 
of the approximately billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day  beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for more than billion servings 
we believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires  needs and lifestyle choices

our goal is to use our company assets our brands  financial strength  unrivaled distribution system  global reach  and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners 
our company markets  manufactures and sells beverage concentrates  sometimes referred to as beverage bases  and syrups  including fountain syrups we refer to this part of our business as our concentrate business or concentrate operations  and finished sparkling and still beverages we refer to this part of our business as our finished product business or finished product operations 
generally  finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations 
in our concentrate operations  we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations to which we typically refer as our bottlers or our bottling partners 
our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners depending on the product  still water and or sparkling water  or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages 
the finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles and are then sold to retailers directly or  in some cases  through wholesalers or other bottlers 
outside the united states  we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups  which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption  or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers 
our finished product operations consist primarily of the production  sales and distribution operations managed by ccr and our company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations 
ccr is included in our north america operating segment  and our company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our bottling investments operating segment 
our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages  such as juices and juice drinks  energy and sports drinks  ready to drink teas and coffees  and certain water products  to retailers or to distributors  wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers 
in addition  in the united states  we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers 
in the united states  we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the united states 
the following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished product operations year ended december  concentrate operations finished product operations net operating revenues includes concentrates sold by the company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups 
the bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers 
includes fountain syrups manufactured by the company  including consolidated bottling operations  and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers 
includes net operating revenues related to our acquisition of cce former north america business for the full year in and in  the percentage includes net operating revenues from the date of the cce acquisition on october  the following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished product operations year ended december  concentrate operations finished product operations  total worldwide unit case volume includes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups 
the bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers 
includes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the company  including consolidated bottling operations  and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers 
includes unit case volume related to our acquisition of cce former north america business for the full year in and in  the percentage includes unit case volume from the date of the cce acquisition on october  acquisition of cce former north america business and related transactions pursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on february   as amended the merger agreement  on october  the acquisition date  we acquired cce former north america business  consisting of cce production  sales and distribution operations in the united states  canada  the british virgin islands  the united states virgin islands and the cayman islands  and a substantial majority of cce corporate segment 
we believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the north american market 
the creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in north america 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the company acquired the percent of cce former north america business that was not already owned by the company for consideration that included the company percent indirect ownership interest in cce european operations  cash consideration  and replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of cce corporate operations and former north america business 
at closing  cce shareowners other than the company exchanged their cce common stock for common stock in a new entity  which was renamed coca cola enterprises  inc which is referred to herein as new cce and which continues to hold the european operations held by cce prior to the acquisition 
at closing  new cce became percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of cce immediately prior to the closing  other than the company 
as a result of this transaction  the company does not own any interest in new cce 
as of october   our company owned percent of the outstanding common stock of cce 
based on the closing price of cce common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date  the fair value of our investment in cce was  million  which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both cce european operations and its former north america business 
we remeasured our equity interest in cce to fair value upon the close of the transaction 
as a result  we recognized a gain of  million  which was classified in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income 
the gain included a million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in cce european operations 
the company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in cce european operations to new cce as part of the consideration to acquire the percent of cce former north america business that was not already owned by the company 
although the cce transaction was structured to be primarily cashless  under the terms of the merger agreement  we agreed to assume billion of cce debt 
in the event the actual cce debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount  we agreed to make a cash payment to new cce for the difference 
as of the acquisition date  the debt assumed by the company was billion 
the total cash consideration paid to new cce as part of the transaction was billion  which included billion related to the debt shortfall 
in contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of cce former north america business  we reached an agreement with dps to distribute certain dps brands in territories where dps brands had been distributed by cce prior to the cce transaction 
under the terms of our agreement with dps  concurrently with the closing of the cce transaction  we entered into license agreements with dps to distribute dr pepper trademark brands in the united states  canada dry in the northeastern united states  and canada dry and c plus in canada  and we made a net one time cash payment of million to dps 
under the license agreements  the company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute dps products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines 
the license agreements have initial terms of years  with automatic year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements 
the license agreements replaced agreements between dps and cce existing immediately prior to the completion of the cce transaction 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with dps to include dr pepper and diet dr pepper in our coca cola freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the united states 
the coca cola freestyle agreement has a term of years 
on october   we sold all of our ownership interests in our norwegian and swedish bottling operations to new cce for billion in cash 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of cce former north america business  we granted to new cce the right to negotiate the acquisition of our majority interest in our german bottler at any time from to months after february   at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed 
the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry we operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry 
we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies 
we  along with other beverage companies  are affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  cost to manufacture and distribute products  consumer spending  economic conditions  availability and quality of water  consumer preferences  inflation  political climate  local and national laws and regulations  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fuel prices and weather patterns 
our objective our objective is to use our formidable assets our brands  financial strength  unrivaled distribution system  global reach  and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates to achieve long term sustainable growth 
our vision for sustainable growth includes the following people being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be 
portfolio bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people desires and needs 
partners nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty 
planet being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference 
profit maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities 
productivity managing our people  time and money for greatest effectiveness 
strategic priorities we have four strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our company and the coca cola system and value for our shareowners 
these strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership  accelerating innovation  leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio  and leading the coca cola system for growth 
to enable the entire coca cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities  we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing  commercial leadership  franchise leadership  and bottling and distribution operations 
core capabilities consumer marketing marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of  and increase consumer preference for  our brands 
this produces long term growth in unit case volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace  we create and implement integrated marketing programs  both globally and locally  that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands 
in developing a strategy for a company brand  we conduct product and packaging research  establish brand positioning  develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback 
our integrated marketing activities include  but are not limited to  advertising  point of sale merchandising and sales promotions 
we have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets  increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our developed markets 
in emerging markets  we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers 
in developing markets  where consumer access has largely been established  our focus is on differentiating our brands 
in our developed markets  we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs  but at a slower rate than revenue growth 
we are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment 
commercial leadership the coca cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers 
we focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses 
our approach includes understanding each customer business and needs whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market 
we focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the company 
we are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences  product availability and delivery systems  and beverage merchandising and displays 
we participate in joint brand building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands 
through our commercial leadership initiatives  we embed ourselves further into our retail customers businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale 
franchise leadership we must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values  aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers always changing needs and tastes 
the financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the company success 
we work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies  and we share best practices throughout the bottling system 
our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins 
with our bottling partners  we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers 
we also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners 
we will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the coca cola system to gain a competitive advantage 
bottling and distribution operations most of our company beverage products are manufactured  sold and distributed by independent bottling partners 
however  over the past several years the amount of company beverage products that are manufactured  sold and distributed by consolidated bottling and distribution operations has increased 
we often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance 
owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources  help focus the bottler sales and marketing programs  assist in the development of the bottler business and information systems  and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler 
our company has a long history of providing world class customer service  demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce 
in addition  we have an experienced bottler management team 
all of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations 
the company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business 
this includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers 
as we further transform the way we go to market  the company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient 
challenges and risks being global provides unique opportunities for our company 
challenges and risks accompany those opportunities 
our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our company 
of these  five key challenges and risks are discussed below 
obesity and inactive lifestyles increasing concern among consumers  public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry 
we recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem and are committed to being a part of the solution 
this commitment is reflected through our broad portfolio  with a beverage to suit every caloric and hydration need 
all of our beverages can be consumed as part of a balanced diet 
consumers who want to reduce the calories they consume from beverages can choose from our continuously expanding portfolio of more than low and no calorie beverages  nearly percent of our global portfolio  as well as our regular beverages in smaller portion sizes 
we believe in the importance and power of informed choice  and we continue to support the fact based nutrition labeling and education initiatives that encourage people to live active  healthy lifestyles 
our commitment also includes creating and adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace  supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education  and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation  choice and variety 
we recognize the health of our business is interwoven with the well being of our consumers  our employees and the communities we serve  and we are working in cooperation with governments  educators and consumers 
water quality and quantity water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our company attention and collaboration with other companies  suppliers  governments  nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate 
water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products and is needed to produce the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies 
it also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve 
today  water is a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation  flourishing food demand  increasing pollution  poor management and the effects of climate change 
our company has a robust water stewardship and management program and continues to work to improve water use efficiency  treat wastewater prior to discharge and to achieve our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products 
we regularly assess the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program 
we are actively collaborating with other companies  governments  nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world 
we are working with our global partners to develop sustainability related water projects 
we are encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system 
through these integrated programs  we believe that our company is in an excellent position to leverage the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve through source water availability assessments  water resource management  water treatment  wastewater treatment systems  and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world  we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial to the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource 
evolving consumer preferences consumers want more choices 
we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs  on the go lifestyles  aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever 
we are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products  innovative packaging  and ingredient and packaging material education efforts 
we are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs  desires and lifestyle choices 
increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace our company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local participants 
we must continue to strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry 
food security increased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities  such as sugarcane  corn  beets  citrus  coffee and tea  which are important sources of ingredients for our products  and could impact the food security of communities around the world 
we are committed to implementing programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability designed to help address these agricultural challenges 
through joint efforts with farmers  communities  bottlers  suppliers and key partners  as well as our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture  we can together help make a strategic impact on food security 
all of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles  water quality and quantity  evolving consumer preferences  increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace  and food security have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our company  however  we believe our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following principles of consolidation purchase accounting for acquisitions recoverability of noncurrent assets pension plan valuations revenue recognition income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of the company significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as vies for which our company is the primary beneficiary 
generally  we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest 
however  there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation ownership of a majority voting interest does not apply 
generally  this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests  which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity voting interests in  and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of  the other business enterprise 
this disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest  and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a vie 
an enterprise must consolidate a vie if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the primary beneficiary has both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our company holds interests in certain vies  primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations  for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary 
our variable interests in these vies primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities  they did not empower us to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the vies economic performance 
our company investments  plus any loans and guarantees  related to these vies totaled  million and  million as of december  and  respectively  representing our maximum exposures to loss 
the company investments  plus any loans and guarantees  related to these vies were not significant to the company consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our company holds interests in certain vies  primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations  for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary 
as a result  we have consolidated these entities 
our company investments  plus any loans and guarantees  related to these vies totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  representing our maximum exposures to loss 
the assets and liabilities of vies for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the company consolidated financial statements 
creditors of our vies do not have recourse against the general credit of the company  regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities 
purchase accounting for acquisitions the company applies the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination 
in general  this methodology requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition 
we estimate fair value using the exit price approach  which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market 
the value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets 
any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets 
management judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives for property  plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets  and can materially affect the company results of operations 
transaction costs  as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies  are expensed as incurred in the company consolidated statements of income 
on october   the company acquired cce former north america business and recorded total assets of billion as of the acquisition date 
the assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above 
during our purchase accounting measurement period  which concluded during the third quarter of  the company made adjustments to certain amounts that resulted in a final balance of billion of total assets being recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to the cce acquisition 
refer to the heading recoverability of noncurrent assets below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to this acquisition 
recoverability of noncurrent assets we perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for certain assets  recoverability and or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other assets  impairment tests are required at least annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and or impairment tests 
if an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees  the company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income loss net in our consolidated statements of income 
however  the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences  deferred taxes and deferred gains 
management assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates 
these estimates require significant management judgment  include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent  therefore  they do not change in isolation 
factors that management must estimate include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volume  pricing  cost of raw materials  delivery costs  inflation  cost of capital  marketing spending  foreign currency exchange rates  tax rates  capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets 
these factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile 
the estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
when performing impairment tests  we estimate the fair values of the assets using management best assumptions  which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed  impairment charges could have resulted 
as mentioned above  these factors do not change in isolation and  therefore  we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future impairment charges could result 
refer to the heading operations review below for additional information related to our present business environment 
certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report  as appropriate 
our company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic  political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate  particularly in developing or emerging markets 
refer to the heading our business challenges and risks above and item a 
risk factors in part i of this report 
as a result  management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world 
investments in equity and debt securities the carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method  the cost method or the fair value method 
we account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method  as applicable 
investments in equity securities are carried at fair value  if the fair value of the security is readily determinable 
equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available for sale securities 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in net income 
unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred taxes  on available for sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci 
trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
securities classified as available for sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets  depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment 
investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method 
in accordance with the cost method  our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared 
cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value 
investments in debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity 
investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available for sale 
the following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities in millions december  carrying value percentage of total assets equity method investments securities classified as available for sale securities classified as trading cost method investments total accounts for less than percent of the company total assets 
investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment  since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income 
we review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available for sale or held to maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment 
when such events or changes occur  we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment 
we also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period 
the fair values of most of our company investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices 
for investments in nonpublicly traded companies  management assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals  as appropriate 
we consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and emerging markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis  management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if management determines the decline is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded 
management assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on  among other things  the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in  the company recognized impairment charges of million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the fair values of certain cost method investments 
these impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the corporate operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net below as well as note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company recognized impairment charges of million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the fair values of certain available for sale securities 
in addition  the company recognized charges of million during related to the impairment of an investment in an entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the corporate operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net below as well as note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company recognized impairment charges of million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the fair values of certain available for sale securities and an equity method investment 
these impairment charges were recorded in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income and impacted the bottling investments and corporate operating segments 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net below as well as note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

total other assets our company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume 
additionally  our company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited 
advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights 
payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets  as appropriate  in our consolidated balance sheets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
as a result of our acquisition of cce former north america business  the company recorded charges of million related to preexisting relationships during the year ended december  these charges were primarily related to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with cce 
our investment in these infrastructure programs with cce did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition 
refer to note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment as of december   the carrying value of our property  plant and equipment  net of depreciation  was  million  or percent of our total assets 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property  plant and equipment should be assessed  including  among others  the manner or length of time in which the company intends to use the asset  a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
when such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property  plant and equipment  including appraisals and discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets intangible assets are classified into one of three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
the following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet in millions december  carrying value percentage of total assets goodwill bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives trademarks with indefinite lives definite lived intangible assets  net other intangible assets not subject to amortization total accounts for less than percent of the company total assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets  including discounted cash flow models  which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
we test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives  including trademarks  franchise rights and goodwill  for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
our company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite lived intangible assets  including  but not limited to  discounted cash flow models  which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  prior to completing the impairment test described above 
the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if the company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the testing described above 
otherwise  the company does not need to perform any further assessment 
during  the company only performed qualitative assessments on less than percent of our indefinite lived intangible assets balance 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segments 
our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility  which is consistent with the way management runs our business 
our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units 
these business units are also our reporting units 
the bottling investments operating segment includes all company owned or consolidated bottling operations  regardless of geographic location  except for bottling operations managed by ccr  which are included in our north america operating segment 
generally  each company owned or consolidated bottling operation within our bottling investments operating segment is its own reporting unit 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit 
the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to completing the two step process described above to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step process 
otherwise  the company will forego the two step process and does not need to perform any further testing 
during  the company only performed qualitative assessments on less than percent of our consolidated goodwill balance 
intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment  primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition 
consequently  if operating results and or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition  it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  as discussed above  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our company actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  if the cost of capital and or discount rates change  our company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to  or greater than  our previously forecasted amounts 
as of our most recent annual impairment review  the company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets  individually or in the aggregate 
in addition  as of december   we did not have any reporting unit with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that it will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term 
however  if macroeconomic conditions worsen  it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets  which would require us to recognize impairment charges 
management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods 
we acquired cce former north america business on october   which resulted in the company recording  million of intangible assets  including goodwill 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the acquired intangible assets included  million of bottler franchise rights  which consisted of  million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and million of franchise rights with definite lives 
the franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided cce with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories 
the franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided cce with exclusive rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and  therefore  have been classified as definite lived intangible assets 
the company recorded  million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition that was assigned to the north america operating segment  of which million has been  and will continue to be  amortized for tax purposes 
this goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in north america 
it also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition  such as an assembled workforce 
pension plan valuations our company sponsors and or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all us employees 
we also sponsor nonqualified  unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi employer pension plans in the united states 
in addition  our company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the united states 
management is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation 
we believe the most critical assumptions are related to the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
all of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation 
at each measurement date  we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans 
as of december  and  the weighted average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was percent and percent  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class 
we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long term rates 
our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due 
as a result  the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  to improve returns and manage risk 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was percent in and in  the company total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was million 
in  we expect our total pension expense to be approximately million 
the anticipated decrease is primarily due to approximately million of contributions the company expects to make to various plans in as well as the impact of favorable returns on plan assets in the favorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the company benefit obligation 
the estimated impact of an additional basis point decrease in the discount rate on our pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately million 
additionally  the estimated impact of a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets on our pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately million 
the sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our us pension plans 
as of december   the company primary us plan represented percent and percent of the company consolidated projected pension benefit obligation and pension assets  respectively 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of products has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our company  this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners  resellers or other customers 
title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations  as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction 
our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part 
our customers can earn certain incentives which are included in deductions from revenue  a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
these incentives include  but are not limited to  cash discounts  funds for promotional and marketing activities  volume based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the company in relation to these programs  including amortization expense on infrastructure programs  were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
in preparing the financial statements  management must make estimates related to the contractual terms  customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue 
management also considers past results in making such estimates 
the actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates 
such differences are recorded once they have been determined and have historically not been significant 
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
refer to the heading operations review income taxes below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position  amount  and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
as of december   the company valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were million and primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions 
current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits 
if we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future  it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
the company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the company does not record a us deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria 
these criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested  or will invest  the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
the decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the company intends to maintain in non us subsidiaries takes into account items including  but not limited to  forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital  liquidity plans  capital improvement programs  merger and acquisition plans  and planned loans to other non us subsidiaries 
the company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the united states 
other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances for example  in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the company local country subsidiary to pay a dividend  economic stability and asset risk 
as of december   undistributed earnings of the company foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to billion 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company effective tax rate is expected to be approximately percent in this estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in recent accounting standards and pronouncements refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements 
operations review our organizational structure as of december   consisted of the following operating segments  the first six of which are sometimes referred to as operating groups or groups eurasia and africa  europe  latin america  north america  pacific  bottling investments  and corporate 
for further information regarding our operating segments  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
structural changes  acquired brands and new license agreements in order to continually improve upon the company operating performance  from time to time  we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations 
in addition  we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings 
these items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the company performance 
unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the company performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level 
the company unit case volume represents the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers and  therefore  reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers 
refer to the heading beverage volume below 
concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by  or used in finished products sold by  the company to its bottling partners or other customers 
refer to the heading beverage volume below 
our bottling investments operating segment and our other finished product operations  including the finished product operations in our north america operating segment  typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages  such as juices and juice drinks  energy and sports drinks  ready to drink teas and coffees  and certain water products  to retailers or to distributors  wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers 
in addition  in the united states  we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption  or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers 
for these consolidated finished product operations  we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer 
our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations 
for these concentrate operations  we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations  and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer 
when we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors volume growth unit case volume or concentrate sales volume  as appropriate  structural changes  changes in price  product and geographic mix and foreign currency fluctuations 
refer to the heading net operating revenues below 
structural changes generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling  distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes 
typically  structural changes do not impact the company unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level 
we recognize unit case volume for all sales of company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner  if any 
however  the unit case volume reported by our bottling investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations 
the company acquired great plains coca cola bottling company great plains in december  bottling operations in vietnam and cambodia in february  and bottling operations in guatemala in june accordingly  the impact to net operating revenues related to these acquisitions was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues 
refer to the heading net operating revenues below 
in january  the company announced that bpw  our joint venture with nestl in the ready to drink tea category  will focus its geographic scope primarily on europe and canada 
the joint venture was phased out in all other territories by the end of  and the company agreement to distribute products in the united states under a sublicense from a subsidiary of nestl terminated at the end of the impact to net operating revenues for north america related to the termination of our license agreement has been included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues 
in addition  we have eliminated the bpw and nestl licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales for the year ended december   in those countries impacted by these structural changes 
we have also eliminated the bpw and nestl licensed unit case volume and associated concentrate sales from the base year  where applicable  when calculating versus volume growth rates 
refer to the headings beverage volume and net operating revenues below 
the company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners 
the ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume 
when we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners  we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer 
when we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners  we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner 
the subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume 
acquired brands refers to brands acquired during the past months 
typically  the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction 
therefore  the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume 
we do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes 
in  the company invested in the existing beverage business of aujan  one of the largest independent beverage companies in the middle east 
under our definitive agreement with aujan  the company now owns percent of the aujan entity that holds the rights to aujan owned brands in certain territories and percent of aujan bottling and distribution operations in certain territories 
accordingly  the volume associated with the aujan transaction  subsequent to our initial equity investment during the second quarter of  is considered to be from acquired brands 
refer to the heading beverage volume below 
license agreements refers to brands not owned by the company  but for which we hold certain rights  generally including  but not limited to  distribution rights  and from which we derive an economic benefit when these brands are ultimately sold 
typically  the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement 
therefore  the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume 
we do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes 
on october   in legally separate transactions  we acquired cce former north america business and entered into a license agreement with dps 
we also sold all of our ownership interests in our norwegian and swedish bottling operations to new cce 
although each of these items does not have an impact on the comparability of the company and consolidated financial statements  the sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on the comparability of our and consolidated financial statements 
acquisition of cce former north america business and the dps license agreements immediately prior to our acquisition of cce former north america business on october   the company owned percent of cce outstanding common stock 
this ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both cce former north america business and its european operations 
on october   the company acquired the remaining percent of cce former north america business not already owned by the company for consideration that included the company indirect ownership interest in cce european operations 
as a result of this transaction  the company now owns percent of cce former north america business and does not own any interest in new cce european operations 
the operating results of cce former north america business were included in our consolidated financial statements starting october  the operating results of new cce do not directly impact the company consolidated financial statements  since we have no ownership interest in this entity 
refer to the heading our business general above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the acquisition 
on october   the company also entered into an agreement with dps to distribute certain dps brands in territories where these brands were distributed by cce prior to our acquisition of cce former north america business 
the license agreements replaced agreements between dps and cce existing immediately prior to the acquisition 
refer to the heading our business general above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details related to these new license agreements 
prior to the acquisition and entering into the dps license agreements  the company north america operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation 
as a result of the acquisition and the dps license agreements  the north america operating segment is now predominantly a finished product operation 
generally  finished product operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations 
refer to item business products and brands for additional discussion of the differences between the company concentrate operations and our finished product operations 
these transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the north america operating segment and our consolidated operating results 
prior to the acquisition  the company reported unit case volume for the sale of company beverage products sold by cce 
after the transaction closing  we report unit case volume of company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction 
prior to the acquisition  the company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to cce 
upon the closing of the transaction  we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until ccr has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer 
the dps license agreements impact both the company unit case and concentrate sales volumes 
sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the company only during the month period following the acquisition 
prior to entering into the license agreements  the company did not include the dps brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume  as these brands were not company beverage products 
refer to the heading unit case volume below for additional information 
prior to the acquisition  we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to cce  excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in cce 
however  subsequent to the acquisition  the company does not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to cce former north america business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold 
for example  in  most of our pre easter concentrate sales to cce impacted our first quarter operating results 
in  our easter related finished product sales had a greater impact on our second quarter operating results 
as a result of this transaction  the company does not have an indirect ownership interest in new cce european operations 
therefore  we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to new cce 
the acquisition of cce former north america business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure  especially in north america 
the following inputs represent a substantial portion of the company total cost of goods sold sweeteners  metals  juices and polyethylene terephthalate pet 
the majority of these costs are included within our north america and bottling investments operating segments 
the company increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases 
many of the derivative financial instruments used by the company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result  the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been  and will continue to be  included as a component of net income in each reporting period 
refer to the heading gross profit margin below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity 
in  the gross profit for our north america operating segment was negatively impacted by million  primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition 
refer to the headings gross profit margin and operating income and operating margin below 
the acquisition of cce former north america business increased the company selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily due to delivery related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher  as a percentage of net operating revenues  for finished product operations compared to concentrate operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition 
the company recorded million of definite lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately eight years from the date of acquisition  which is equal to the weighted average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights 
in addition  the company recorded million of customer rights that are being amortized over years 
we estimate the amortization expense related to these definite lived intangible assets to be approximately million per year for the next several years  which will be recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in connection with the company acquisition of cce former north america business  we assumed  million of long term debt  which had an estimated fair value of  million as of the acquisition date 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date 
refer to the heading liquidity  capital resources and financial position cash flows from financing activities debt financing below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company recognized a gain of  million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in cce to fair value upon the close of the transaction 
this gain was classified in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income 
prior to the closing of this acquisition  we had accounted for our investment in cce under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we recorded our proportionate share of cce net income or loss in the line item equity income loss net in our consolidated statements of income 
however  as a result of this transaction  beginning october   the company no longer records equity income or loss related to cce  and therefore  this transaction negatively impacted the amount of equity income the company recorded during both and refer to the heading equity income loss net below 
divestiture of norwegian and swedish bottling operations the divestiture of our norwegian and swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume  for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of cce former north america business 
the divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the bottling investments operating segment 
in addition  the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the bottling investments operating segment 
however  since we divested a finished product business  it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins 
furthermore  the impact these divestitures had on the company net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations 
these concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions 
the net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues 
refer to the heading net operating revenues below 
this divestiture resulted in a gain of million in  which was classified in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income 
in  the company recorded charges of million related to the finalization of working capital adjustments in connection with the divestiture of our norwegian and swedish bottling operations 
these charges reduced the transaction gain the company previously reported in beverage volume we measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways unit cases of finished products and concentrate sales 
as used in this report  unit case means a unit of measurement equal to us fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings  and unit case volume means the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers 
unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks 
also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to  or distributed by  our company  and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit 
in addition  unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest 
we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level 
the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors 
concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by  or used in finished beverages sold by  the company to its bottling partners or other customers 
unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period 
factors such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases  new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates 
in addition to the items mentioned above  the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures  in which the company has an equity interest  but to which the company does not sell concentrates or syrups  may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates 
information about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows percent change vs 
vs 
year ended december  unit cases  concentrate sales unit cases  concentrate sales worldwide eurasia africa europe latin america north america pacific bottling investments n a n a bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only 
geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers  both consolidated and unconsolidated  and distributors in the applicable geographic areas 
unit case volume the coca cola system sold approximately billion unit cases of our products in  approximately billion unit cases in and approximately billion unit cases in the number of unit cases sold in does not include bpw unit case volume for those countries in which bpw was phased out in  nor does it include unit case volume of products distributed in the united states under a sublicense from a subsidiary of nestl which terminated at the end of in addition  the company eliminated bpw and nestl licensed unit case volume from the base year  where applicable  when calculating versus volume growth rates below

liquidity  capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths 
refer to the heading cash flows from operating activities below 
the near term outlook for our business remains strong  and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in as a result of our expected cash flows from operations  we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments 
the company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock 
instead  we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
refer to the heading cash flows from financing activities below 
we have a history of borrowing funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 
our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy 
the company reviews its optimal mix of short term and long term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper  short term debt and current maturities of long term debt with new issuances of long term debt in the future 
in addition to the company cash balances  commercial paper program  and our ability to issue long term debt  we also had  million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of december  these backup lines of credit expire at various times from through we have significant operations outside the united states 
unit case volume outside the united states represented approximately percent of the company worldwide unit case volume in we earn a substantial amount of our consolidated operating income and income before income taxes in foreign subsidiaries that either sell concentrate to our local bottling partners or  in certain instances  sell finished products directly to our customers to fulfill the demand for company beverage products outside the united states 
a significant portion of these foreign earnings is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
the company cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled billion as of december  with the exception of an insignificant amount  for which us federal and state income taxes have already been provided  we do not intend  nor do we foresee a need  to repatriate these funds 
additionally  the absence of a government approved mechanism to convert local currency into us dollars in argentina and venezuela restricts the company ability to pay dividends from these locations 
as of december   the company subsidiaries in argentina and venezuela held million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities 
subsequent to december   the venezuelan government devalued its currency  which will result in the company remeasuring the net assets of our subsidiary in venezuela 
based on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities denominated in venezuelan bolivar as of december   we anticipate recognizing a remeasurement loss of million to million during the first quarter of net operating revenues in the united states were billion in  or percent of the company consolidated net operating revenues 
we expect existing domestic cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities  cash flows from operations and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities 
in the future  should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations  or is available through the issuance of domestic debt  we could elect to repatriate future periods earnings from foreign jurisdictions 
this alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate 
while the likelihood is remote  the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company would be subject to additional us income taxes net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions  where applicable 
this alternative could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the company foreign subsidiaries 
based on all the aforementioned factors  the company believes its current liquidity position is strong  and we will continue to meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future

the cash flow impact in other investing activities primarily represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents on the deconsolidated entities balance sheets as of december  cash flows from financing activities our cash flows provided by used in financing activities were as follows in millions year ended december  issuances of debt payments of debt issuances of stock purchases of stock for treasury dividends other financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows  interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital 
we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital  which increases our return on shareowners equity 
this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates 
our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings 
as of december   our long term debt was rated aa by standard poor  aa by moody and a by fitch 
our commercial paper program was rated a by standard poor  p by moody and f by fitch 
in assessing our credit strength  all three agencies consider our capital structure including the amount and maturity dates of our debt and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the company 
in addition  some rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers  including new cce  coca cola amatil  coca cola bottling co 
consolidated  coca cola femsa and coca cola hellenic 
while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable 
it is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology 
if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure  our major bottlers financial performance  changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength  or for any other reason  our cost of borrowing could increase 
additionally  if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline  the company share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers 
we monitor our financial ratios and  as indicated above  the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings 
each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios 
these thresholds are not necessarily permanent  nor are they always fully disclosed to our company 
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world  enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost 
this posture  coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing 
our debt management policies  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets 
issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities

these fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately years 
the amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods  which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt 
total interest paid was million  million and million in  and  respectively

issuances of stock the issuances of stock in  and were primarily related to the exercise of stock options by company employees 
share repurchases on july   the board of directors of the company authorized a share repurchase program of up to million shares of the company common stock 
the program took effect on october  although there are approximately million shares that may yet be purchased under this share repurchase program  the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to million shares of the company common stock on october  the new share repurchase program will allow the company to continue repurchasing shares following the completion of the prior program 
the table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share year ended december  as adjusted number of shares repurchased in millions average price per share since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in through our current program as of december   we have purchased approximately billion shares of our company common stock at an average price per share of 
in addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors  the company treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the company to pay the exercise price and or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees 
in  we repurchased billion of our stock 
however  due to the timing of settlements  the total amount of treasury stock purchases that settled during was billion  which includes treasury stock that was purchased and settled during as well as treasury stock purchased in december that settled in early the net impact of the company treasury stock issuance and purchase activities in resulted in a net cash outflow of billion 
we currently expect to repurchase an additional billion to billion of our stock during  net of proceeds from the issuance of stock due to the exercise of employee stock options 
dividends at its february meeting  our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by percent  raising it to per share  equivalent to a full year dividend of per share in this is our st consecutive annual increase 
our annual common stock dividend was per share  per share and per share in  and  respectively 
the dividend represented an percent increase from  and the dividend represented a percent increase from off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
as of december   we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of million  of which million was related to vies 
these guarantees are primarily related to third party customers  bottlers  vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees were individually significant 
the amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees  however  we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees 
management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our company under these guarantees is not probable 
as of december   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
our company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had  million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes 
these backup lines of credit expire at various times from through there were no borrowings under these backup lines of credit during these credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions 
some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances  none of which are presently significant to our company 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   the company contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows in millions payments due by period total and thereafter short term loans and notes payable commercial paper borrowings lines of credit and other short term borrowings current maturities of long term debt long term debt  net of current maturities estimated interest payments accrued income taxes purchase obligations marketing obligations lease obligations held for sale obligations total contractual obligations refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable 
upon payment of outstanding commercial paper  we typically issue new commercial paper 
lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs  especially at international subsidiaries 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term debt 
we will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt  including the use of cash flows from operating activities  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
we calculated estimated interest payments for our long term fixed rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates 
we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding income taxes 
as of december   the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits  was million  which was not included in the total above 
at this time  the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined 
in addition  any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including long term contractual obligations  open purchase orders  accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities 
we expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assets and liabilities of our consolidated philippine and brazilian bottling operations being classified as held for sale 
the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december   was  million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  pension expense  funding levels  plan amendments  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and the investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
the pension protection act of ppa was enacted in august and established  among other things  new standards for funding of us defined benefit pension plans 
we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of plan assets was  million 
the majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets and the decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to calculate the company benefit obligation 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was  million 
the majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non us employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions  as well as our unfunded us nonqualified pension plans 
these us nonqualified pension plans provide  for certain associates  benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of the expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above 
however  we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately million in and remain near that level through  decreasing annually thereafter 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we expect to contribute an additional million to various pension plans 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above 
in general  we are self insured for large portions of many different types of claims  however  we do use commercial insurance above our self insured retentions to reduce the company risk of catastrophic loss 
our reserves for the company self insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions  adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history 
as of december   our self insurance reserves totaled approximately million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not include estimated payments related to our self insurance reserves in the table above 
deferred income tax liabilities as of december   were  million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
foreign exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations and governmental actions 
we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments  and to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
in  we used functional currencies 
due to our global operations  weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others 
in  and  the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations all operating currencies  and for certain individual currencies  strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows year ended december  all operating currencies brazilian real mexican peso australian dollar south african rand british pound euro japanese yen these percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share 
the total currency impact on operating income  including the effect of our hedging activities  was a decrease of approximately percent and an increase of approximately percent in and  respectively 
based on spot rates as of the beginning of february  our hedging coverage in place  and the impact of venezuela currency devaluation discussed below  the company expects currencies to have a percent negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of and a percent negative impact on operating income for the full year of foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies 
the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income loss net in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the heading operations review other income loss net above 
the company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
hyperinflationary economies our company conducts business in more than countries  some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years 
these economies create financial exposure to the company 
in  venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy  and the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate of exchange official rate from bolivars per us dollar to bolivars per us dollar for essential goods and bolivars per us dollar for nonessential goods 
in order to utilize the official rate  entities must seek approval from the government operated foreign exchange administration board cadivi 
in accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our local subsidiary was required to use the us dollar as its functional currency 
as a result  during the first quarter of we remeasured the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of bolivars per us dollar which resulted in a loss of million 
the loss was recorded in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income 
we classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in june  the venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme 
this system  which was subject to annual limits  enabled entities domiciled in venezuela to exchange their bolivars to us dollars through authorized financial institutions commercial banks  savings and lending institutions  etc in december  the venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of bolivars per us dollar for essential goods 
as a result  the only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar denominated transactions were the official rate of bolivars per us dollar for nonessential goods and the sitme rate 
as discussed above  the company remeasured the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of bolivars per us dollar starting on january  therefore  the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiary 
subsequent to december   the venezuelan government devalued its currency further to an official rate of bolivars per us dollar 
the government also announced that it was discontinuing the sitme foreign exchange system 
as a result  the company will remeasure the net assets of our local subsidiary and recognize the related gains or losses from remeasurement in the line item other income loss net in our consolidated statement of income 
based on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities denominated in venezuelan bolivar as of december   we anticipate recognizing a remeasurement loss of million to million during the first quarter of the company will continue to use the official rate to remeasure the net assets of our venezuelan subsidiary 
if the official rate devalues further  it would result in our company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange gains or losses in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately million and monetary liabilities of approximately million 
in addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our venezuelan subsidiary net assets  we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in venezuela from outside the country 
these sales are denominated in us dollars 
if we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism to settle future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in venezuela  the company outstanding receivables balance related to these sales will continue to increase 
in addition  we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in venezuela 
if the bolivar further devalues  it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets 
as of december   the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in venezuela for these concentrate sales and intangible assets associated with products sold in venezuela totaled million 
the company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world 
in general  we believe that  over time  we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability

the table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events cash and cash equivalents decreased  million  or percent  primarily due to a change in the company overall cash management program which resulted in more of our cash balances being transferred into short term investments as well as high quality marketable securities 
as a result of this change in strategy  short term investments increased  million and marketable securities increased  million 
a majority of the company consolidated cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
assets held for sale increased  million due to our consolidated philippine and brazilian bottling operations being classified as held for sale 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions and their impact on other line items in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  equity method investments increased  million  or percent  primarily due to the company new investments in aujan  one of the largest independent beverage companies in the middle east  and mikuni  a bottling partner located in japan 
the increase was also due to the impact of the merger of andina and polar  foreign currency translation adjustments and additional equity income recorded during loans and notes payable increased  million  or percent  primarily due to an increase in the company commercial paper balance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to months in advance  however  the majority of our derivative instruments expire within months or less 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
we monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems 
in prior years  the company primarily used the value at risk methodology for its quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
however  with the company acquisition of cce former north america business in  and the related changes to our consolidated balance sheet  the company has provided a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates we manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
in  we used functional currencies and generated  million of our net operating revenues from operations outside the united states  therefore  weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strength in other currencies over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
our company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options principally euro and japanese yen and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations 
the total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
this total includes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges 
the fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in an asset of million as of december  at the end of  we estimate that an unfavorable percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of million 
the fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in an asset of million  and we estimate that an unfavorable percent change in rates would have increased our net losses by million 
all losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged item  resulting in no net material impact on earnings 
interest rates the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  as well as our mix of short term debt versus long term debt 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on the company variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december   a percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by million in however  this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates 
in  we changed our overall cash management program and made additional investments in highly liquid debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk related to these investments 
these investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company investment policy 
our policy requires investments to be investment grade  with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
in addition  our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we estimate that a percent increase in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the fair market value of the portfolio 
commodity prices the company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations  principally related to our purchases of aluminum and plastic  sweeteners and energy 
whenever possible  we manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business 
we also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks at times 
certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  but they are effective economic hedges that help the company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet 
open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts resulted in a liability of million 
the potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments  assuming a percent decrease in underlying commodity prices  would have increased our net loss by million 
open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts had a fair value of million 
the potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments  assuming a percent decrease in underlying commodity prices  would have eliminated our net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of million
