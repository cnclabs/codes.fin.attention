item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report  as well as our other filings with the sec 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions  as set forth under disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the following discussion and under the caption risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this report 
overview throughout this discussion  we compare results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  or the comparable period 
despite a poor start in the first quarter of and very little revenue growth in the second and third quarters of  we attained higher revenue in when compared to due to a strong finish in the fourth quarter of on february   we completed the acquisition of the video conferencing business of israel based vcon video conferencing  ltd 
vcon 
vcon was a pioneer in software based video conferencing solutions with product offerings that include group video conferencing endpoints  desktop video conferencing endpoints  video conferencing infrastructure solutions and software development kits 
this acquisition and the combination of streaming and digital signage technologies have provided us with complementary technology opportunities allowing us to enter new growth markets 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  clearone paid consideration of million in cash to vcon for all vcon assets  including intellectual property  fixed assets and inventory and assumed no debt 
overall revenue increased marginally in due to the contribution of additional revenue from the businesses acquired in and and due to growth in revenue from unified communications audio end points 
revenue from our professional audio communication products declined slightly in our gross profit during declined marginally while our net income surged to million from million in net income in and benefited by credits of million and million  respectively  from litigation proceeds 
we derive a major portion approximately of our revenue from the americas  which include north america and latin america 
our share of revenue from foreign markets outside the americas was slightly higher in when compared to the audio visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology 
our competitors vary within each product category 
the professional audio communication products  which contribute the most to our revenue  despite a small decline in revenues in  continues to perform strongly largely due to our professional microphone products and our popular mid tier premium conferencing products 
despite our strong leadership position in the professional audio communications products market  we face challenges to revenue growth due to continuing popularity of mid tier premium conferencing products within the product mix in opposition to higher cost professional conferencing products 
revenue from unified communications audio end points grew in despite increasing competition in the personal conferencing products market 
the additional revenue from visual communication products through acquisitions in and contributed to our overall growth 
we expect the recently introduced professional microphone products will complement our professional conferencing products and drive our revenue growth 
we intend to increase our penetration of the unified communications audio end points market through deepening and expanding our partnerships with large it distributors 
we believe we are also well positioned to capitalize on the continuing migration away from the traditional hardware based video conferencing to software based video conferencing 
we believe the momentum derived from the strong fourth quarter in will continue into if the underlying global economic conditions do not weaken 
even though our cash position has increased due to the recent receipt of settlement proceeds  recent acquisitions will increase our operating costs 
we will continue to exercise fiscal discipline and balance the need to invest in the growth of our product offerings future against the need to maintain the profitability of the company 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  together with the percentage of total revenue which each item represents 
year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable amount of revenue amount of revenue amount revenue cost of goods sold gross profit sales and marketing research and product development general and administrative proceeds from litigation operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue our revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period 
revenue during increased by approximately thousand  or  from the comparable period 
the additional revenue in from visual audio products resulting from our acquisitions and the increase in revenue by from unified communications audio end points contributed to the marginal increase in revenue in the above increases were partially offset by a decline of in revenue from professional audio communications products 
the share of professional audio communications products in our mix decreased from approximately in to approximately in during revenue from europe  middle east and africa grew by while revenue from the americas declined by 
at each quarter end  we evaluate the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided by certain of our distributors 
the level of inventory in the channel fluctuates up or down each quarter based upon our distributors individual operations 
accordingly  each quarter end revenue deferral is calculated and recorded based upon the underlying channel inventory at quarter end 
during and  the change in deferred revenue based on the movement of inventory in the channel was a deferral of revenue of thousand and a recognition of revenue of thousand  respectively 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold cogs includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers  the manufacture of our products including material and direct labor  our manufacturing and operations organization  property and equipment depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments  and the allocation of overhead expenses 
our gross profit during was approximately million compared to approximately million in the comparable period  a decrease of 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to increased obsolescence costs associated with inventory 
gross profit margins gpm  or gross profit as a percentage of sales  declined to in from in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our profitability in the near term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional audio communications products 
we hold considerable amounts of long term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long term inventory  profitability might be affected by inventory write offs and price mark downs 
operating expenses and profits losses operating profits losses  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are deducted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
total operating expenses after excluding net litigation proceeds were million in compared to million during the comparable period 
net litigation proceeds were million in compared to million in following is a more detailed discussion of expenses related to sales and marketing  research and product development  general and administrative  and other items 
sales and marketing 
s m expenses include sales  customer service  and marketing expense such as employee related costs  allocations of overhead expenses  trade shows  and other advertising and selling expenses 
total s m expenses were approximately million in both and s m expenses as a percentage of revenue also remained the same in both and research and product development 
r d expenses include research and development  product line management  engineering services  and test and application expenses  including employee related costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses 
total r d expenses were million in compared to million during the comparable period 
as a percentage of revenue  r d expenses increased to in compared to in the increase in r d expenses was primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to recent acquisitions and increased headcount  increase in consulting fees and accelerated amortization of certain r d assets 
general and administrative 
g a expenses include employee related costs  professional service fees  allocations of overhead expenses  litigation costs and corporate administrative costs  including costs related to finance and human resources 
total g a expenses were approximately million in compared with approximately million in the increase in g a expenses was primarily due to special bonuses awarded to key contributors to litigation settlement  increased costs associated with the recently acquired operations of video conferencing business  an increase in amortization of intangibles  an increase in legal expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debts 
proceeds from litigation 
we received million from ubs as settlement of a dispute  that was under arbitration 
the settlement award was subject to a contingency legal fee of million paid in december to our litigation counsel 
see section titled ars special arbitration under 
note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized in income of approximately million received from one of our competitors upon our successful litigation in the matter related to the theft of our intellectual property 
see section titled theft of our intellectual property and related cases under 
note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes the tax expense of million during was primarily the result of tax on current year income 
this compared to a tax expense of million during liquidity  capital resources and financial position as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million compared to million as of december  our working capital was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately million during  an increase of approximately million  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher net income resulting from net litigation proceeds  an increase in deferred revenue and increased cash inflows on inventory 
these increases in cash inflows were partially offset by outflows on reduced accounts payable 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net cash flows used in investing activities were million during compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of million during during  the cash outflows on investing activities consisted of the acquisition of vcon business for million and the purchase of property and equipment 
during  the cash outflows on investing activities consisted of the acquisition of magicbox business for thousand and the purchase of property and equipment 
please refer to 
note business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii  item for details on the acquisitions in and net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options amounting to thousand and associated tax benefits of thousand  offset by the acquisition of outstanding stock totaling thousand under the stock repurchase program 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling thousand and associated tax benefits totaling thousand 
we believe that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet our short term and long term operating requirements and finance our growth plans 
we also believe that our strong financial position and sound business structure will enable us to raise additional capital when needed to meet our short and long term financing needs 
in addition to capital expenditures  we may use cash in the near future for selective infusions of technology  sales marketing  infrastructure  and other investments to fuel our growth  as well as acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and are accretive to our performance 
we may also use cash to finance the repurchase of our outstanding stock 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our electronics manufacturing service providers and other contractual obligations of approximately million  primarily related to inventory purchases 
at december   we had inventory totaling million out of which non current inventory accounted for million 
this compares to total inventories of million and non current inventory of million as of december  as our business prospects continue to improve  we expect to continue to reduce our non current inventory and convert it into cash 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial conditions  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial position are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in 
note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies identify our most critical accounting policies  which are the policies that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue and associated allowances for revenue adjustments and doubtful accounts included in continuing operations is product revenue  primarily from product sales to distributors  dealers  and end users 
product revenue is recognized when i the products are shipped and any right of return expires  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price is fixed and determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
we provide a right of return on product sales to major distributors under a product rotation program 
under this seldom used program  once a quarter  a distributor is allowed to return products purchased during the prior quarter for a total value generally 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations not exceeding of the distributor s net purchases during the preceding quarter 
the distributor is  however  required to place a new purchase order for an amount not less than the value of products returned under the stock rotation program 
when products are returned  the associated revenue  cost of goods sold  inventory and accounts receivable originally recorded are reversed 
when the new order is placed  the revenue  associated cost of goods sold  inventory and accounts receivable are recorded and the product revenue is subject to the deferral analysis described below 
in a small number of cases  the distributors are also permitted to return the products for other business reasons 
revenue from product sales to distributors is not recognized until the return privilege has expired or until it can be determined with reasonable certainty that the return privilege has expired  which approximates when the product is sold through to customers of our distributors dealers  system integrators  value added resellers  and end users  rather than when the product is initially shipped to a distributor 
at each quarter end  we evaluate the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided by our distributors 
the level of inventory in the channel will fluctuate up or down each quarter based upon our distributors individual operations 
accordingly  each quarter end deferral of revenue and associated cost of goods sold are calculated and recorded based upon the actual channel inventory reported at quarter end 
further  with respect to distributors and other channel partners not reporting the channel inventory  the revenue and associated cost of goods sold are deferred until we receive payment for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners 
the accuracy of the deferred revenue and costs depend to a large extent on the accuracy of the inventory reports provided by our distributors and other resellers and any material error in those reports would affect our revenue deferral 
however  we believe that the controls we have in place  including periodic physical inventory verifications and analytical reviews  would help us identify and prevent any material errors in such reports 
the amount of deferred cost of goods sold was included in consigned inventory 
the following table details the amount of deferred revenue  cost of goods sold  and gross profit as of december  deferred revenue deferred cost of goods sold deferred gross profit we offer rebates and market development funds to certain of our distributors  dealers resellers  and end users based upon volume of product purchased by them 
we record rebates as a reduction of revenue in accordance with gaap 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a majority of our channel partners and perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our channel partners to make required payments based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
our actual bad debts in future periods may differ from our current estimates and the differences may be material  which may have an adverse impact on our future accounts receivable and cash position 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we allocated the purchase price for the acquisitions of netstreams in  magicbox in and vcon in on the basis of well established valuation techniques performed by qualified experts 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner if a triggering event occurs suggesting possible impairment of the values of these assets 
in association with the acquisition of netstreams  thousand and thousand were recorded as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life  respectively 
with respect to the magicbox acquisition  thousand and thousand were recorded as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life  respectively 
goodwill of million was recorded in connection with the vcon acquisition 
there were no impairments recorded in or as no impairment indicators existed 
however  due to uncertainty in the industrial  technological  and competitive environments in which we operate  we might be required to exit or dispose of the assets acquired through the netstreams  magicbox or vcon acquisitions  which could result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and definite lived intangibles subject to amortization  annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of other groups of assets 
the impairment of long lived assets requires judgments and estimates 
if circumstances change  such estimates could also change 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less the estimated costs to sell 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and in certain non us jurisdictions 
we estimate our current tax position together with our future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  depreciation  and other reserves for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  prior year carryback  or future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
in accordance with asc topic  accounting for income taxes  we analyzed our valuation allowance at december  and determined that based upon available evidence it is more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers and state research and development credits will not be realized and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets in the amount of thousand 
please refer to 
note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
lower of cost or market adjustments and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory we account for our inventory on a first in  first out basis  and make appropriate adjustments on a quarterly basis to write down the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
in addition to the price of the product purchased  the cost of inventory includes our internal manufacturing costs  including warehousing  material purchasing  quality and product planning expenses 
we perform a quarterly analysis of obsolete and slow moving inventory to determine if any inventory needs to be written down 
in general  we write down our excess and obsolete inventory by an amount that is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value if market value is less than cost  based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand  shelf life of the product  inter changeability of the product and market conditions 
those items that are found to have a supply in excess of our estimated current demand are considered to be slow moving or obsolete and classified as long term 
an appropriate reserve is made to write down the value of that inventory to its expected realizable value 
these charges are recorded in cost of goods sold 
the reserve against slow moving or obsolete inventory is increased or reduced based on several factors which  among other things  require us to make an estimate of a product s life cycle  potential demand and our ability to sell these products at estimated price levels 
while we make considerable efforts to calculate reasonable estimates of these variables  actual results may vary 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances  and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
share based payments prior to june   and as permitted under the then existing fasb guidelines under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for our share based payments following the recognition and measurement principles of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as interpreted 
accordingly  no share based compensation expense had been reflected in our statements of operations for unmodified option grants since the exercise price equaled the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date  and the related number of shares to be granted upon exercise of the stock option was fixed on the grant date 
in december  the fasb issued guidelines now contained under fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
asc topic establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
primarily  this topic focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
under asc topic  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
therefore  if an employee does not ultimately render the requisite service  the costs associated with the unvested options will not be recognized cumulatively 
effective july   we adopted the guidelines contained in asc topic and its fair value recognition provisions using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost recognized after july  includes the straight line basis compensation cost for a all share based payments granted prior to july   but not yet vested  based on the grant date fair values used for the pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
and b all share based payments granted or modified on or after july   in accordance with the provisions of asc topic under asc topic  we recognize compensation cost net of an anticipated forfeiture rate and recognize the associated compensation cost for those awards expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we use judgment in determining the fair value of the share based payments on the date of grant using an option pricing model with assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the risk free interest rate of the awards  the expected life of the awards  the expected volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividends of the awards  and an estimate of the amount of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if assumptions change in the application of asc topic and its fair value recognition provisions in future periods  the stock based compensation cost ultimately recorded under the guidelines of asc topic may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements after evaluating the recent accounting pronouncements through the date of this filing  the company has concluded that application of them will have no material impact on the company s financial results
