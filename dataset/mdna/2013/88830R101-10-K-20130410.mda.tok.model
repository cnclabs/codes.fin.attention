item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing under item some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and expected financial results  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors under item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business description we own and operate a network of full service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the united states and europe 
based upon information provided to us by cnh global nv or its nv subsidiary cnh america  llc  collectively referred to in this annual report as cnh  we are the largest retail dealer of case ih agriculture equipment in the world  the largest retail dealer of case construction equipment in north america and a major retail dealer of new holland agriculture and new holland construction equipment in the us we operate our business through two reportable segments  agriculture and construction 
within each segment  we have four principal sources of revenue  new and used equipment sales  parts sales  service  and equipment rental and other activities 
the agricultural equipment we sell and service includes machinery and attachments for uses ranging from large scale farming to home and garden use 
the construction equipment we sell and service includes heavy construction and light industrial machinery for commercial and residential construction  road and highway construction and mining applications 
we offer our customers a one stop solution for their equipment needs through new and used equipment sales  parts sales  repair and maintenance services  and equipment rental and other activities 
the new equipment and parts we sell are supplied primarily by cnh 
according to public reports filed by cnh  cnh is a leading manufacturer and supplier of agricultural and construction equipment based on the number of units sold  primarily through the case ih agriculture  new holland agriculture  case construction and new holland construction brands 
sales of new cnh products accounted for approximately of our new equipment revenue in fiscal  with our single largest manufacturer other than cnh representing approximately of our total new equipment sales 
we acquire used equipment for resale through trade ins from our customers and selective purchases 
we sell parts and provide in store and on site repair and maintenance services 
we rent equipment and provide other ancillary services such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and finance and insurance products 
throughout our year operating history we have built an extensive  geographically contiguous network of stores  including two outlet stores  located in the united states and stores in europe 
we have a history of growth through acquisitions  including acquisitions consisting of stores operating in eleven states and four european countries since january  we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 

table of contents certain external factors affecting our business we are subject to a number of factors that affect our business as discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements 
certain of the external factors include  but are not limited to  the following industry factors our agriculture business is primarily driven by the demand for agricultural equipment for use in the production of food  fiber  feed grain and renewable energy  home and garden applications  and the maintenance of commercial  residential and government properties 
based on usda data  we believe farmers have recently experienced historically strong economic fundamentals  driven by growing global demand for agricultural commodities in part due to growth in renewable energy and the economies of developing countries 
this strong farm economy contributed significantly to our results of operations in fiscal  and we believe our large and diverse customer base within our geographic footprint of five states and four european countries limits our exposure to negative events that may occur in a particular area or crop 
additionally  we believe that acquisition opportunities will continue to be strong 
our construction business is primarily impacted by the demand for construction equipment for use in private and government commercial  residential and infrastructure construction  demolition  maintenance  mining  energy and forestry operations 
cnh and industry reports show that demand for construction equipment in our markets is driven by several factors  one of which is public infrastructure spending  including roads and highways  sewer and water 
any growth in federal allocations to public infrastructure spending over the next few years should positively impact our future results of operations 
likewise  any decline in federal allocations to public infrastructure spending over the next few years should negatively impact our future results of operations 
to address the uncertainty of the construction industry  we expect to continue our focus on the agriculture industry and acquisition opportunities to establish additional locations in the markets where we believe the local construction industry will maintain its current level or grow 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation due to varying weather patterns  which may impact the timing and amount of equipment purchases  rentals  and after sales parts and service purchases by our agriculture and construction customers 
economic cyclicality sales of agricultural equipment historically have fluctuated with general farm economic trends  primarily driven by net farm income 
sales of construction equipment historically have fluctuated with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  construction equipment retailers tend to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
credit market changes changes in credit markets can affect our customers ability and willingness to make capital expenditures  including purchasing our equipment 
creditors tightened their lending standards following the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market and these conditions may still be continuing in some areas 
these tightened lending standards may have a negative impact on our business if our customers are unable to obtain financing for equipment purchases 
however  if retail interest rates remain low  our business may be positively affected by customers who find financing purchases of our equipment more attractive due to lower borrowing costs 
our business is also particularly dependent on our access to credit markets to finance acquisitions and manage inventory 
continued tightened lending standards 
table of contents may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms 
we cannot predict what future changes will occur in credit markets or how these changes will impact our business 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results and we do not expect it to have such an impact in the future 
to date  in those instances in which we have experienced cost increases  we have been able to increase selling prices to offset such increases 
however  our business may be affected by inflation and we may not be able to continue to increase our selling prices to offset increased costs and remain competitive 
acquisitions we have a successful history of growth through acquisitions 
since january   we have completed acquisitions consisting of stores operating in states and four european countries 
these acquisitions have been the most significant factor affecting our results of operations and liquidity over the last several years  as noted in the period to period comparisons below 
we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 
acquisitions are typically financed with floorplan debt  long term debt and cash from operations 
although we cannot quantify the impact of any such potential acquisitions  we believe the nature of their impact on our financial statements to be similar to that experienced with our prior acquisitions as noted in our discussions of period comparisons 
critical accounting policies and estimates during the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect reported amounts 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments include those related to realization of inventory  initial valuation and impairment analyses of goodwill and other intangible assets  collectability of receivables and income taxes 
we update these estimates  assumptions and judgments as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we use our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our financial statements are appropriate  they are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our primary critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition equipment revenue is recognized upon receipt of a signed contract and delivery of product to customers 
however  in certain circumstances  and upon the customer written request  equipment revenue is recognized before delivery occurs 
under these bill and hold arrangements  the equipment is available for shipment  the company has fulfilled all of its performance obligations and received a signed sales contract  and the customer has completed and signed a bill and hold agreement 
credit terms on bill and hold arrangements are consistent with credit terms on all other equipment sales 
parts revenue is recognized upon delivery of product to customers 
service revenue is recognized at the time the related services are provided 
rental revenue is recognized over the period of the related rental agreement 
in addition to outright sales of new and used equipment  certain rental agreements may include rent to purchase options 
under these agreements  customers are given a period of time to exercise an option to purchase the related equipment  with a portion of the rental payments being applied to reduce the purchase price 
payments received during the rental period are recorded as rental revenue 
any such equipment is included in inventory until the purchase option is exercised  and the carrying value of the equipment is reduced in accordance with our inventories policies 
equipment revenue is recognized upon the exercise of the purchase option 

table of contents inventories new and used equipment are stated at the lower of cost specific identification or market value with adjustments for decreases in market value on inventory rented but available for sale  estimated as a percentage of the rental income received on such inventory 
all new and used equipment inventories  including that which has been rented  are subject to periodic lower of cost or market evaluation that considers various factors including aging of equipment and market conditions 
equipment inventory values are adjusted whenever the estimated market value exceeds the carrying amount 
parts inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market value 
an estimate of parts inventories not expected to be sold in the next year has been reported separately  which is based on historical sales of parts on hand 
we estimate a reserve on our parts inventories based on various factors including aging and sales of each type of parts inventory 
work in process is valued at the retail rates of labor incurred and retail parts inventories used on service work in process at year end 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of the businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or when circumstances indicate that impairment may be present 
we perform our annual impairment test as of the end of our fiscal year 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have identified four reporting units which carry a goodwill balance 
the goodwill impairment analysis is performed under a two step impairment model  in which under step one  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on a discounted cash flow analysis  an income approach  which includes a five year forecast of future operating performance for each of the reporting units and a terminal value estimate for all periods beyond the five year forecast period 
the estimated future cash flow streams of each of the reporting units is discounted to arrive at the present value of the estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied reflects our estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of companies similar in nature and size to us 
we performed our annual impairment test as of the end of our fiscal year and concluded that no impairment existed in any of our reporting units 
further  for each reporting unit which carries a material amount of goodwill  the estimated fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value 
our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units incorporated certain key assumptions  including estimated revenue growth  gross margin and operating expense levels  working capital investments required to support anticipated revenue growth  capital spending trends  our estimate of long term sustained growth  and the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
our estimates inherently include a degree of uncertainty  and these estimates could be significantly impacted 
table of contents by factors such as general macroeconomic or industry conditions  changes in the competitive environment and changes in customer behaviors 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in deriving the fair values of our reporting units are reasonable and are based on the best information available 
however  deterioration in macroeconomic or industry conditions  a prolonged decrease in the price of our common stock  or adverse changes in expectations of future performance could result in an impairment charge in a future period which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets with an indefinite life consist of distribution rights with manufacturers 
we classify distribution rights as an indefinite lived intangible asset because our distribution agreements continue indefinitely by their terms  or are routinely awarded or renewed without substantial cost to us or material modifications to the underlying agreements 
as such  we believe that our distribution rights intangible assets will contribute to our cash flows for an indefinite period  therefore  the carrying amount of distribution rights is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or when circumstances indicate that impairment may be present 
we perform our annual impairment test as of december st of each year 
the impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the lowest level in which identifiable cash flows can be attributed to the asset 
for our distribution rights intangible assets  we have determined that the lowest level of cash flows which can be attributed to the asset is equal to the store  or complex of stores  acquired in the business combination which resulted in the initial recognition of the intangible asset  plus any additional store locations operating within the geographical area of the distribution rights 
under the impairment test  we estimate the fair value of our distribution rights intangible assets based on a multi period excess earnings model  an income approach 
the multi period excess earnings model allocates future forecasted earnings of the store s amongst working capital  fixed assets and other intangible assets of store s and any remaining earnings the excess earnings are allocated to the distribution rights intangible assets 
the earnings allocated to the distribution rights are then discounted to arrive at the present value of the future estimated excess earnings  which represents the estimated fair value of the distribution rights intangible asset 
the discount rate applied reflects our estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of companies similar in nature and size to us  plus an additional risk premium to reflect the additional risk inherent in the distribution right asset 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no impairment existed for any distribution rights intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair values of our distribution rights intangible assets incorporated certain key assumptions  including estimated revenue growth  gross margin derived from equipment revenue  operating expense levels  the required rates of return on working capital  fixed assets and other intangible assets  and the discount rate applied to the estimated future earnings 
our estimates inherently include a degree of uncertainty  and these estimates could be significantly impacted by factors such as general macroeconomic or industry conditions  conditions specific to the store s supporting the distribution right assets including prolonged negative weather patterns  and changes in the competitive environment 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in deriving the fair value of each of the distribution rights assets are reasonable and based on the best information available 
however  adverse changes in macroeconomic or industry conditions or adverse changes in our expectations about the future operating performance of the store s supporting the distribution rights assets could result in an 
table of contents impairment charge in a future period which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
collectability of receivables the carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management reviews aged receivable balances and estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
account balances are charged off after all appropriate means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of receivables  inventory  property and equipment  intangible assets  stock based compensation  senior convertible notes and accrued expenses for financial and income tax reporting 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters within our provision for income taxes 
we perform a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements and recognition standards established by the fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
pursuant to this guidance  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
business combinations the accounting for business combinations requires the purchase price to be allocated amongst the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
estimating the fair value of certain assets and liabilities requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets  the expected useful life of the acquired assets and the discount rate applied to the future cash flow streams 
the accounting for business combinations allows the acquirer to finalize the acquisition accounting during the measurement period  which may not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 
during the measurement period  the accounting for the business combination transactions may be based on estimates due to various unknown factors present at the date of acquisition 
key financial metrics in addition to tracking our sales and expenses to evaluate our operational performance  we also monitor certain key financial metrics  including dollar utilization  absorption and same store sales 
dollar utilization dollar utilization is a measurement of asset performance and profitability used in the rental industry 
we calculate the dollar utilization of our rental fleet equipment by dividing the rental revenue earned on our rental fleet by the average gross carrying value of our rental fleet for that period 
our dollar utilization rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 

table of contents absorption absorption is an industry term that refers to the percentage of an equipment dealer fixed operating expense covered by the combined gross margin from our parts and service and rental fleet activity 
absorption in a given period is calculated by dividing our gross profit from sales of parts  service and rental fleet activity in the period by the difference between i our operating expenses including interest on floorplan notes payable and rental fleet debt and ii our variable expense of sales commissions on equipment sales and incentive compensation in the same period 
we believe that absorption is an important management metric because during economic down cycles our customers tend to postpone new and used equipment purchases while continuing to run  maintain and repair their existing equipment 
thus  operating at a high absorption rate enables us to operate profitably throughout economic down cycles 
we measure and track absorption on a company wide basis as well as on a per store basis 
our company wide absorption rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
same store sales same store sales for any period represent sales by stores that were part of our company for the entire comparable period in the preceding fiscal year 
we do not distinguish relocated or newly expanded stores in this same store analysis 
closed stores are excluded from the same store analysis 
we believe that tracking this metric is important to evaluating the success of the titan operating model on a comparable basis 
key financial statement components revenue equipment 
we derive equipment revenue from the sale of new and used agricultural and construction equipment 
parts 
we derive parts revenue from the sale of parts for equipment that we sell  as well as for other equipment makes 
our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is less sensitive to the economic cycles that affect our equipment sales 
service 
we derive services revenue from repair and maintenance services to our customers equipment 
our repair and maintenance services provide a high margin  relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles 
rental and other 
we derive other revenue from equipment rentals and ancillary equipment support activities such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and reselling finance and insurance products 
cost of revenue equipment 
cost of equipment revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the specific piece of equipment sold 
parts 
cost of parts revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the parts sold  based on average costing 
service 
cost of service revenue represents costs attributable to services provided for the maintenance and repair of customer owned equipment and equipment then on rent by customers 
rental and other 
costs of other revenue represent costs associated with equipment rental  such as depreciation  maintenance and repairs  as well as costs associated providing transportation  hauling  
table of contents parts freight  gps subscriptions and damage waivers  including  among other items  drivers wages  fuel costs  shipping costs and our costs related to damage waiver policies 
operating expenses our operating expenses include sales and marketing expenses  sales commissions which generally are based upon equipment gross profit margins  payroll and related benefit costs  insurance expenses  professional fees  property rental and related costs  property and other taxes  administrative overhead  and depreciation associated with property and equipment other than rental equipment 
floorplan interest the cost of financing inventory is an important factor affecting our results of operations 
floorplan financing from cnh capital and our credit agreement represent the primary sources of financing for equipment inventories 
cnh regularly offers interest free periods as well as additional incentives and special offers 
as of january   approximately of our floorplan notes payable was non interest bearing 
other interest expense interest expense represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments  including our senior convertible notes issued in april the convertible notes  other than floorplan financing facilities 
results of operations comparative financial data for each of our four sources of revenue for fiscal   and are expressed below

table of contents fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  consolidated results revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands equipment parts service rental and other total revenue the increase in revenue was primarily due to same store sales growth and acquisitions contributing to fiscal revenue 
same store sales growth contributed million  an increase of over the prior year  while the acquired stores contributed million in additional total revenue 
revenue growth was across all revenue sources and in both our agriculture and construction segments 
the increase in equipment revenue was primarily due to a strong agriculture equipment market caused by strong net farm income for calendar year gross profit fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands gross profit equipment parts service rental and other total gross profit gross profit margin equipment parts service rental and other total gross profit margin gross profit mix equipment parts service rental and other total gross profit mix the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue  partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin for equipment 
acquisitions contributed million of the increase in total gross profit  while same store sale gross profit provided the remaining million 
the decrease in gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin for equipment and change in sales mix  in which our equipment business 
table of contents contributed a larger percentage of our total gross profit  as compared to the prior year 
the gross profit margin on equipment was negatively impacted by competitive agriculture and construction equipment retail environments in the regions in which we operate 
due to these factors  we were able to maintain sales activity but experienced a compression in our overall equipment margins and in particular our used equipment margins 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions  such as compensation  rent  travel and depreciation 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to improved fixed operating cost leverage resulting from higher revenue 
other income expense fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands interest and other income floorplan interest expense other interest expense the increase in floorplan interest expense of million and other interest expense of million  as compared to the prior year  was due to the increase in floorplan notes payable balances and our convertible notes issued in april provision for income taxes fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  decrease percent change dollars in thousands provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin for equipment  which was negatively impacted by increased equipment availability in the market resulting in a competitive equipment retail environment  and an increase in floorplan interest expense resulting from higher floorplan notes payable balances  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
construction construction segment revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal the revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions and a construction same store sales increase of as compared to fiscal the same store sales growth was positively impacted by a growing construction industry in a portion of the region in which we do business and an increase in our rental business  reflecting our initiative to expand this growth platform through strategic acquisitions  new store openings  and an increase in the size of our rental fleet 
construction segment income loss before income taxes decreased million in fiscal primarily due to a lower gross profit margin on equipment  a decrease in the dollar utilization of our rental fleet from in fiscal to in fiscal  and an increase in floorplan interest expense and other interest expense  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in the gross profit margin on equipment was primarily due to competitive markets in the regions in which we operate  caused by an increase in equipment supply in the construction industry and the associated competitive pricing pressures  especially affecting some of our stores in larger metro areas 
the increase in floorplan interest expense and other interest expense resulted from an increase in floorplan notes payable balances and rental fleet debt  respectively  as compared to the prior year 

table of contents shared resources eliminations we incur centralized expenses income at our general corporate level  which we refer to as shared resources  and then allocate these net expenses to our segments

fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  consolidated results revenue fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands equipment parts service rental and other total revenue the increase in revenue was primarily due to same store sales growth and acquisitions contributing to fiscal revenue 
same store sales growth contributed million  an increase of over the prior year  while the acquired stores contributed million in additional total revenue 
this revenue growth was achieved in both our agriculture and construction segments and resulted from the continuation of a strong agriculture equipment market  an improved construction equipment market in the region in which we do business  and growth in the rental business in our construction segment 
the increase in the rental business reflected our initiative to expand this growth platform through strategic acquisitions  including the purchase of abc rental equipment sales in the first quarter of fiscal  new store openings  and an increase in the size of our rental fleet

acquisitions contributed million of the increase in total gross profit  while same store sale gross profit provided the remaining million 
the increase in gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in gross profit margin for equipment and rental and other 
the increase in equipment gross profit margin was primarily reflective of an improved construction equipment market in the region in which we do business 
the increase in gross profit margin on rental and other was due to an increase in the size and utilization of our rental fleet 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions  such as compensation  rent  travel and depreciation 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased slightly to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the slight decrease was primarily due to improved fixed operating cost leverage resulting from higher revenues more than offsetting an increase in our sales commissions  which are calculated based on equipment gross profits rather than revenues  and a larger portion of our business coming from our construction segment  which require higher operating expenses and included additional expenses in fiscal associated with growing the rental business

cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in our non manufacturer floorplan notes payable of million 
during fiscal  the increase in floorplan financing with non manufacturers resulted from borrowings under our credit agreement 
non gaap cash flow reconciliation we consider our cash flow from operating activities to include all equipment inventory financing activity regardless of whether we obtain the financing from a manufacturer or other source 
we consider equipment inventory financing with both manufacturers and other sources to be part of the normal operations of our business and use the adjusted cash flow analysis in the evaluation of our equipment inventory and inventory flooring needs 
non gaap cash flow provided by used for operating activities is a non gaap financial measure which is adjusted for the following non manufacturer floorplan notes payable the adjustment is equal to the net change in non manufacturer floorplan notes payable  as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
gaap categorizes non manufacturer floorplan notes payable as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
impact of senior convertible notes we issued million of convertible notes in april we used a significant amount of the proceeds from the convertible notes to reduce our

table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash reserves  cash flow from operations  proceeds from our public stock offerings  proceeds from the issuance of debt and our convertible notes  and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources 
adequacy of capital resources our primary uses of cash have been to fund our strategic acquisitions  finance the purchase of inventory  meet debt service requirements and fund operating activities  working capital  payments due under building space operating leases and manufacturer floorplan notes payable 
the primary factors affecting our ability to generate cash and to meet existing  known or reasonably likely cash requirements are the timing and extent of acquisitions and our operating performance as impacted by i industry factors  ii competition  iii general economic conditions and iv other business factors as identified in item a risk factors 
for fiscal and  our cash expenditures on property and equipment excluding rental fleet were million and million  respectively  exclusive of acquisitions  transfers between equipment inventory and our rental fleet  and property and equipment purchased with long term debt 
we expect our property and equipment expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions and rental fleet  for fiscal to be approximately to million 
the actual amount of our fiscal property and equipment expenditures will depend upon factors such as general economic conditions  growth prospects for our industry and our acquisition activity 
we currently expect to finance property and equipment purchases with borrowings under the existing credit facilities  with available cash or with cash flow from operations 
we may need to incur additional debt if we pursue any future acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt will depend upon our ability to generate the necessary cash 
this will depend on our future acquisition activity  operating performance  general economic conditions  and financial  competitive  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our immediate control 
based on our current operational performance  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under the existing credit facilities will adequately provide our liquidity needs for  at a minimum  the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the credit facilities with the wells fargo bank syndicate and cnh capital in amounts sufficient to allow us to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain sufficient future borrowings  we may be required to seek one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with one of these alternatives on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we pursue strategic acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing to consummate the transactions  and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining this financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we incur additional indebtedness to finance any of these transactions  this may place increased demands on our cash flow from operations to service the resulting increased debt 
our existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to adopt any of these alternatives 
any non compliance by us under the terms of our debt agreements could result in an event of default which  if not cured  could result in the acceleration of our debt 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which 
table of contents would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb amended authoritative guidance on the parent accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity  codified in asc  foreign currency matters 
the amendments require an entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity to apply the guidance in asc  translation of financial statements  to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income 
accordingly  the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided 
for an equity method investment that is a foreign entity  the partial sale guidance in asc  derecognition  still applies 
as such  a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income upon a partial sale of such an equity method investment 
the guidance is effective for derecognition events occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance on february  its adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb amended authoritative guidance on reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  codified in asc  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance did not change existing disclosure requirements  but requires presentation of information about significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in one place within the financial statements  or cross referenced to related footnote disclosures 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance on february  its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

in july  the fasb amended authoritative guidance on impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets  codified in asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the amended guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if an entity determines that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired  then the entity is not required to perform a quantitative assessment 
however  if an entity concludes that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired  it is required to perform the impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
the guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance on july  and utilized it in our annual indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing as of january  its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we have both fixed and floating rate financing 
some of our floating rate credit facilities contain minimum rates of interest to be charged 
based upon balances and interest rates as of january   holding other variables constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the next month period would decrease pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for the next month period would result in an increase to pre tax earnings and cash flow of approximately million 
at january   we had variable rate floorplan notes payable of million  of which approximately million was interest bearing  variable notes payable and long term debt of million  and fixed rate notes payable and long term debt of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise as the result of our foreign operations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  as our net investment in our foreign operations is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the company is exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar  whereby the results of our operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency transaction risk as the result of certain intercompany financing transactions 
the company attempts to manage its foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign exchange forward contracts 
based upon balances and exchange rates as of january   holding other variables constant  we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
