project shield features our tegra processor  contains proprietary nvidia developed software and system technologies and leverages our deep partnerships with game developers all over the world 
headquartered in santa clara  california  we were incorporated in california in april and reincorporated in delaware in april our businesses we have two primary reporting segments the gpu business and the tegra processor business 
during the last several years  we have operated and reported three reporting segments the gpu business  the professional solutions business  and the consumer products business 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we began reporting two segments to reflect the way we are now managing our businesses internally which is based on whether the underlying products leverage our gpu or our tegra processor technologies 
comparative periods presented reflect this change 
our gpu business leverages our gpu technology across multiple end markets 
it now comprises four primary product lines including geforce for desktop and notebook pcs and macs  quadro for professional workstations  tesla for high performance servers and workstations  and nvidia grid for server graphics solutions 
it also includes other related products  licenses and revenue supporting the gpu business  such as memory products 
our tegra processor business comprises product lines primarily based on our tegra soc and modem processor technologies 
this includes tegra for smartphones and tablets for both android and windows rt based devices  automotive computers  including infotainment and navigation systems  and gaming devices such as project shield 
it also includes other related products  licenses  and revenue supporting the tegra processor business such as icera baseband processors and rf transceivers  embedded products  and licenses and other revenue associated with game consoles 
in addition to the two reporting segments discussed above  the all other category primarily includes licensing revenue from our patent cross licensing agreement with intel 
recent developments  future objectives and challenges gpu business during fiscal year  we launched our new kepler gpu architecture across our gpu products 
kepler was initially launched in our geforce desktop and notebook pc products in early fiscal year and gradually powered tesla and quadro devices during the second half of fiscal year our kepler products are faster  smaller and more power efficient than products based on our previous architecture 
in our tesla product line  we introduced the k and k family of gpu accelerators based on the kepler architecture during fiscal year  making the technology behind the world fastest supercomputer  titan  at oak ridge national laboratory available to all 
we also announced that the space research organization in india was utilizing their supercomputer for aerospace with gpu architecture  or saga  system to improve the design and analysis of new and existing satellite launch vehicles 
additionally  we launched the grid vgx  a first of its kind technology  which makes it possible to access graphics intensive applications on a remote server from virtually any computing device  anywhere by connecting to the cloud  instead of on a local pc or workstation 
with our new grid vgx product line  we are leveraging gpus beyond the pc into the server 
tegra processor business during fiscal year  the first tegra phone  the htc one x  was launched 
further  fujitsu arrows x  a quad core lte smartphone powered by tegra  began shipping into japan in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  google launched its nexus tablet powered by our tegra nexus was the first device to run jelly bean  the latest version of the android operating system

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cash equivalents and marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill  stock based compensation  warranty liabilities  litigation  investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
for most sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our policy on sales to certain distributors  with rights of return  is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product  as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets 
we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale  unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate 
unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs 
we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense  depending on the nature of the program 
mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products 
depending on market conditions  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 

table of contents license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed 
for most license and service arrangements  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement  we record revenue over the life of the license term  with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties 
we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses  and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy 
our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers  the financial institutions providing letters of credit  or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future 
factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables  the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit 
we have incurred cumulative bad debts of million over the last three fiscal years 
as a result of our low bad debt experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and during fiscal years and as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented of our gross accounts receivable balance 
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis  which approximates actual cost on an average or first in  first out basis 
inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs  including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory provisions and shipping costs 
we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand  future product purchase commitments  estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our current inventory or our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down  our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted 

table of contents as of january   our inventory reserve was million 
as a percentage of our gross inventory balance  our inventory reserve has ranged between and during fiscal years and as of january   our inventory reserve represented of our gross inventory balance 
warranty liabilities cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition 
under limited circumstances  we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products 
our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
during the three fiscal years ended january   we recorded a cumulative net charge of million  most of which was charged against cost of revenue  to cover customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations 
determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience  test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return and replacement and other associated costs 
if the actual repair  return  replacement and other associated costs and or actual field failure rates exceed our estimates  we may be required to record additional reserves  which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 
income taxes we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non us subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not  we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 

table of contents our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of million as of january  consistent with prior years  the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity  if and when realized 
in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized  we have elected to utilize the with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits 
we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes  and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations 
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
goodwill goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we identified four reporting units for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis 
determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
in fiscal year  we early adopted an accounting standard update  commonly referred to as a step zero approach  which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing 
for those reporting units where a significant change or events occur  and where potential impairment indicators exist  we continue to utilize a two step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing the fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
qualitative assessment in considering the step zero approach to testing goodwill for impairment  we perform a qualitative analysis evaluating factors including  but not limited to  macro economic conditions  market and industry conditions  competitive environment  operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and budgeted to actual revenue results 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we utilized a qualitative analysis for two reporting units where no significant change occurred and no potential impairment indicators arose since the previous annual evaluation of goodwill and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units is more than their carrying values on a reporting unit basis 
our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions  such as a decline in our operating results  an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment  a substantial decline in our stock price  or any other adverse change in market conditions  we may be required to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis 
in addition  if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that  if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material to our results of operations 

table of contents quantitative assessment we utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for two reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately and 
we have considered both the income method and market method  where applicable  when determining the fair value of reporting units 
our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting primarily towards the income method to estimate the reporting unit fair value 
the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis while the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium 
our estimates of cash flow were based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions 
our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models  which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
the long term financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results  which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit 
the market method of determining the fair value of our reporting unit requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables 
any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting unit  reductions in the value of market comparables  or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit 
such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit 
cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition 
marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased 
we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholder s equity  net of tax 
any unrealized losses which are considered to be other than temporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value 
the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets 
our level assets consist of our money market funds 
we classify securities within level assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
our available for sale securities are classified as having level inputs 
our level assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian 
most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level inputs 
we do not have any investment classified as level as of january  all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary  or have other indicators of impairments 
if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument 
if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value 
for available for sale debt instruments that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss  if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 

table of contents stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date  and recognize the expense using a straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant  minus a dividend yield discount  as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units  or rsus 
we calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes model 
our stock based compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model 
we determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  weighted average expected term  risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  dividend yield  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 
the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumption of our company 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility 
dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts 
prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on november   the fair value of our equity awards was based on an expected dividend yield of reflecting our prior history in which we had not paid and did not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
for awards granted on or subsequent to november   we now use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter 
our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting  therefore  the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield 
additionally  for employee stock option and rsu awards  we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
using the binomial model  we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during fiscal year weighted average expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our espp during fiscal year  using the following assumptions weighted average expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield 
table of contents litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation  fines and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation  investigations or settlements is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events  we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue

fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal year and billion for fiscal year  an increase of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to  million for fiscal year when compared to  million for fiscal year this growth was largely attributable to the introduction of gpus based on our kepler architecture in fiscal year geforce notebook revenues increased on the strength of kepler based design wins on the ivy bridge platform 
strong demand for kepler based geforce desktop gpu products also contributed to the increase in gpu business revenues 
the gpu business also benefited from a greater than increase in tesla revenue in fiscal offsetting these increases were a decrease in quadro revenue  which we believe was due primarily to general weakness in western europe  and a continued decline in sales of our mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 

table of contents tegra processor business 
tegra processor business revenue increased by to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our tegra based smartphones and tablet devices as we transitioned from the previous generation tegra based products and introduced our tegra based processors in windows rt based tablet devices 
additionally  revenues for our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices also increased during fiscal year offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue from license fees and other revenue related to game consoles 
all other 
the increase in revenue is also due to revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january we recognized million in related licensing revenue during the entire twelve months of fiscal year  while fiscal year only included million in related revenue reflecting only ten months of the corresponding revenue 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal year and billion for fiscal year  an increase of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue decreased by to  million for fiscal year when compared to  million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 
memory sales also decreased due to lower sales volume as decreases in market price for memory made it attractive for add in card manufacturers to buy memory directly from the market rather than from us 
additionally  our tesla product revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume 
offsetting these decreases were increases in geforce desktop and notebook revenues from continued market penetration of our fermi architecture based gpus 
strength of our fermi architecture and resultant design wins on the sandy bridge platform contributed to the increase in geforce notebook revenues 
quadro revenues improved slightly as the average selling price  or asp  for workstation products improved due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year tegra processor business 
tegra processor business revenue increased by to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase in revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from the acceleration of our tegra smartphone and tablet products in the mobile market and in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets 
revenue from development arrangements and license fees related to game consoles remained stable in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year all other 
revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of million of licensing revenue in fiscal year from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel that we entered into in january and began recognizing in april concentration of revenue we generated  and of our total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas 
revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers  add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 
revenue from significant customers  those representing or more of total revenue for the respective dates  is summarized as follows year ended january  january  january  revenue customer a customer b 
table of contents gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs  including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs 
cost of revenue also includes development costs for license  service arrangements and stock based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing 
gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margin was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mix 
our strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets  lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix 
however  we may experience difficulties in the transition to new manufacturing processes 
we expect gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal year to stay flat relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows fiscal year vs 
fiscal year our gross margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our high end geforce desktop products  plus tesla and quadro products 
the addition of a full year of revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel compared to ten months of such corresponding revenue in fiscal year also contributed to the improvement in gross margin 
offsetting these were the unfavorable impact of higher net provisions for inventory in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year our gross margin is favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down 
sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately and in fiscal years and  respectively 
conversely  our gross margin is unfavorably impacted by provisions for new inventory reserves 
the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a unfavorable impact in fiscal year and a favorable impact in fiscal year gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to a richer product mix of our kepler based high end nanometer geforce desktop products and our quadro products 
memory margins strengthened on improved market pricing 
these favorable contributors to gross margin were primarily offset by higher net inventory reserves in fiscal year compared to fiscal year tegra processor business 
the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased slightly during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was the result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of revenue from areas such as license fees and other revenues related to game consoles  which typically have higher gross margins than our tegra products  offset by a higher mix of revenue from sales of our tegra products  which grew substantially during the year 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year our gross margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel  entered into in january additionally  the increase in unit sales and a richer product mix of our geforce desktop and notebook products and quadro workstation products as well as manufacturing cost efficiencies and strong management of inventory also helped our gross margin improve in fiscal year other favorable impacts to gross margin were the absence in fiscal year of a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of million recorded in fiscal year related to a weak die packing material set and lower provisions for net inventory reserves in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately and in fiscal years and  respectively 
offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves 
the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a favorable impact in fiscal year and a unfavorable impact in fiscal year

offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of million due to lower litigation related costs and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of million due to certain software and lease hold improvements of buildings that became fully depreciated during fiscal year legal settlement on january   we entered into a six year cross licensing agreement with intel and also mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes 
the fair valued benefit prescribed to the legal settlement portion was million and was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we expect operating expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year  relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  primarily due to employee related costs  including supporting infrastructure costs related to planned hiring

operating activities operating activities generated cash of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in net income and unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year for example  accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year and inventory increased as a result of the production ramp of kepler based gpu products 
cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year for example  accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and inventory decreased as a result of an increase in inventory turnover 
higher non cash charges in earnings including stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities

investing activities used cash of million   million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively

financing activities financing activities used cash of million during fiscal year and provided cash of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to our repurchase of million of common stock and our first ever cash dividend payments of million 
these uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a non cash tax benefit of million related to employee stock based compensation

liquidity our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations 
our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents  commercial paper  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  money market funds and debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
as of january   we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our statement of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other than temporary

table of contents our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses  and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy 
three customers accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable balance at january  while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers  and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums  any of which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the future  we may have to record additional reserves or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside of the united states 
as of january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of billion held within the united states and billion held outside of the united states 
most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
further  repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws 
as of january   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries  as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
although we have no current need to do so  if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states  we would incur us federal and state income tax  less applicable foreign tax credits  and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
further  in addition to the billion of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs  we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where us income tax may otherwise be due 
accordingly  we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business  as a whole  or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states

the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
as part of our share repurchase program  we have entered into  and we may continue to enter into  structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions 
these agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement  and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock  within a pre determined range  at the end of the term of the agreement

please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding stock based compensation related to equity awards granted under our equity incentive programs 
cash dividend program prior to fiscal year  we had never declared or paid any dividend on shares of our common stock 
on november   we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program 
this quarterly dividend of per share is equivalent to per share on an annual basis 
the initial cash dividend was paid on december  to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on november  a subsequent cash dividend of per share was declared on february   payable on march  to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on february  in fiscal year  we paid million in dividends to our common stockholders 
our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board of directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition  stock repurchase  cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures during fiscal year  primarily for property development  leasehold improvements  software licenses  emulation equipment  computers and engineering workstations 
in fiscal year  we expect to break ground on a new building for our headquarters campus in santa clara to provide for our near term growth needs 
this  square foot building will provide  seats and be built on land we purchased five years ago 
we estimate capital funding of million for the campus development project in fiscal year in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 
for additional factors see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business  industry and partners our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed  which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

table of contents product defect our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field  which could cause our revenue to decline 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
during the three year period ended january   we recorded a cumulative net charge of million  most of which was charged against cost of revenue  to cover customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations 
determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience  test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return and replacement and other associated costs 
if the actual repair  return  replacement and other associated costs and or actual field failure rates exceed our estimates  we may be required to record additional reserves  which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment and interest rate risk as of january  and january   we had billion and billion  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents  asset backed securities  commercial paper  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  money market funds and debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
as of january   we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities 
our investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately million 
the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  inability of customers  including channel partners  to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer  including channel partner  insolvencies  and failure of financial institutions  which may negatively impact our treasury operations 
other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments  impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments  interest rates  and cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 
as of january   our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately of our total investment portfolio  while the financial sector accounted for approximately of our total investment portfolio 
substantially all of our investments are with a a or better rated securities 
if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by  the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other expense  net in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant 
the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 

table of contents we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january
