table of contents revenue overview below are analyses of the company s revenue  provided for each of the following by reportable segment geographic region by product platform type by disease family diagnostics only revenue overview by reportable segment geographic region our reportable segments are diagnostics and life science 
the diagnostics segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and canada north america  europe  middle east and africa emea  and other countries outside of north america and emea rest of the world  or row 
the life science segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  boca raton  florida  london  england  luckenwalde  germany  and sydney  australia  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  pcr qpcr reagents  nucleotides  competent cells and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad  including a sales and business development location in singapore 
the life science segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of cgmp clinical grade proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases  and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected from quarter to quarter by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues

of these account placements  approximately  accounts have completed evaluations and validations and are regularly purchasing product  with the balance of our account placements being in some stage of product evaluation and or validation 
of our account placements  we have over accounts that are regularly purchasing  evaluating and or validating two or more assays 

table of contents we continue to invest in new product development for our molecular testing platform  illumigene 
this platform now has four commercialized tests  with three additional tests expected to be available for sale in fiscal illumigene c 
difficile commercialized in august illumigene group b streptococcus group b strep or gbs commercialized in december illumigene group a streptococcus group a strep commercialized in september illumigene mycoplasma m 
pneumonia  walking pneumonia commercialized in june illumigene bordetella pertussis whooping cough expected first half fiscal illumigene chlamydia trachomatis expected second half fiscal illumigene neisseria gonorrhea expected second half fiscal additional illumigene tests in early stage research or development include herpes simplex virus i ii  enteric parasites such as giardia  foodborne pathogens such as e 
coli  and bloodborne pathogens such as malaria 
we believe that the diagnostic testing market is continuing to move away from culture and immunoassay testing to molecular testing for diseases where there is a favorable cost benefit position for the total cost of healthcare 
while this market is competitive  with molecular companies such as cepheid and becton dickinson and new entrants such as quidel  great basin  nanosphere  and others  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the migration to molecular testing 
our simple  easy to use  illumigene platform  with its expanding menu  requires no expensive equipment purchase and little to no maintenance cost 
these features  along with its small footprint and the performance of the illumigene assays  make illumigene an attractive molecular platform to any size hospital 
immunoassay products sales of our diagnostic segment s immunoassay products increased in fiscal  following a decrease in fiscal the current year increase results primarily from the revenue growth of our h 
pylori and foodborne products  as described below 
life science products during fiscal  sales of our life science segment increased  with sales of our molecular component business increasing over fiscal and sales of our immunoassay component business decreasing 
life science segment sales increased in fiscal  reflecting increases in both our molecular and immunoassay component businesses of and  respectively 
our molecular component business continues to benefit from new product launches and advancements most notably sensifast and mytaq pcr components while our bulk immunoassay component business is focusing on improving its operating efficiency and developing revenue opportunities in asia

difficile products during fiscal our c 
difficile product family sales totaled  representing growth of 
this followed growth of in fiscal this overall product family growth is largely driven by the growth of our illumigene c

while the c 
difficile market continues to be highly competitive  we are the only company that can offer a full range of high performing  fda cleared  c 
difficile testing formats  including toxin  gdh and molecular tests 
foodborne products with fiscal sales totaling  we continue to see demand increases for foodborne products  all of which are immunoassay products  as laboratories realize the benefits of increased sensitivity and faster turnaround time with our tests for enterohemorrhagic e 
coli ehec and campylobacter  compared to traditional culture methods 
sales increases for these products were and during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while historically the primary competition for our foodborne products has been laboratory culture methods  during one of our competitors  alere  cleared through the fda a shiga toxin test that competes with our ehec test 
despite this new competition  our revenue growth rate improved in fiscal we believe that our products have two principal advantages versus culture methods i test accuracy  and ii improved work flow  resulting in a significantly shortened time to test result minutes vs 
hours for culture 
h 
pylori products during fiscal  sales of h 
pylori products  all of which are immunoassay products  grew to  which followed growth during fiscal this increase continues to reflect the benefits of our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy  and the ongoing effects of such strategy moving physician behavior away from serology based testing toward direct antigen testing 
a significant amount of the h 
pylori product sales are to reference labs  whose buying patterns may not be consistent period to period 
respiratory products total respiratory sales for our diagnostics segment increased to  during fiscal  following a decrease in the sales of such products in fiscal contributing to the current year increase were increased sales of influenza products  reflecting the strength of this year s influenza season  compared to last year s  and growth in our illumigene group a strep product  which as previously noted  received fda approval in september 
table of contents foreign currency during fiscal  currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on revenue  favorable within the diagnostics segment and unfavorable in the life science segment 
this compares to currency exchange having an approximate  unfavorable impact on revenue in fiscal   within the diagnostics segment and in the life science segment

the fiscal increase results in large part from the combined effects of our i ongoing efforts to control spending in each of our segments while investing the necessary resources in our strategic areas of growth  including increased investment in research development for our molecular platform products  ii increased sales personnel costs in europe in connection with filling open positions and upgrading talent  iii increased incentive compensation compared to fiscal based upon improved operating results  and iv costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of our saco  maine operations into our memphis  tennessee location during fiscal of approximately  we expect to have higher levels of research development spending during fiscal related to clinical trials for our illumigene chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhea products 
during fiscal  the increase in operating expenses resulted in large part from the combined effects of our i fiscal efforts to control spending in each of our segments while investing the necessary resources in our strategic areas of growth  ii beginning to realize cost savings during from the consolidation of our life science immunoassay component manufacturing operations into one facility in tennessee  iii incurring costs in connection with the maine tennessee facility consolidation of approximately  during fiscal  and approximately  during fiscal of an operating expense nature  and iv incurring during the second quarter of fiscal approximately  of costs in connection with the reorganization of our european and global sales and marketing leadership

the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
during fiscal  we granted restricted shares and restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted share units vesting in full in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal although dividend equivalents were paid on these shares and units throughout fiscal  because meridian s net earnings did not reach the minimum level in fiscal  the performance based awards were not earned and no stock based compensation was recorded for these performance based awards 

table of contents during fiscal  we granted restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted share units vesting in total on the fourth anniversary of the grant date  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal although dividend equivalents were paid on these units throughout fiscal  because meridian s net earnings did not reach the minimum level in fiscal  the performance based awards were not earned and no stock based compensation was recorded for these performance based awards 
additionally  during fiscal  we granted restricted share units and options to certain executive management employees to reward them for meeting company revenue targets in advance of planned expectations 
these awards can only be earned if specified cumulative revenue thresholds are met one fiscal quarter in advance of planned revenue expectations through fiscal  with the three measurement dates for ratably earning one third of the grant being i the month period ending june   ii the month period ending june  and iii the month period ending june  to date  no expense has been recognized for these restricted share units and options  and as a result of the cumulative threshold for the month period ended june  not being met  one third of the restricted share units and options granted have been cancelled 
similar to previous years  during fiscal  we granted restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted share units vesting in total on the fourth anniversary of the grant date  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal although dividend equivalents were paid on these units throughout fiscal  because meridian s net earnings did not reach the minimum level in fiscal  the performance based awards were not earned and no stock based compensation was recorded for these performance based awards 
operating income operating income increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes has remained relatively stable during the fiscal years reflected at  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
these rates reflect the net effects of various items  such as i the release of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the passage of the relevant statutes of limitations  ii the effect of adjusting  upon filing of the tax returns  the previously estimated permanent differences between income for financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes  and iii the net tax benefit on dividends from a foreign based subsidiary 

table of contents impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources liquidity our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
our investment portfolio presently consists of overnight repurchase agreements 
we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions  to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations  although no assurances can be made in this regard 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand 
if needed  we also have an additional source of liquidity through our  bank credit facility 
approximately  of our accounts receivable at september  is due from italian hospital customers whose funding ultimately comes from the italian government  which is down from approximately  at september  our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectibility of our customer accounts receivable or impact credit terms with our vendors  or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 
fluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
as of september   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of 
this relationship  stock price trading at a x multiple of book value  is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets 

table of contents our overall cash position improved nearly  during fiscal  to  at september  the primary contributors to the increase in our cash position were the net effects of i our increase in net earnings  ii our relatively modest capital expenditures  and iii our payment of approximately  of cash dividends 
net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and dividends during the next twelve months 
during fiscal  the per share amount of our cash dividend represented of our diluted earnings per share  in line with our long standing policy of establishing a dividend payout ratio between and of diluted earnings per share 
during fiscal  we believe that this positive dividend payout relationship will continue  although no assurances can be made in this regard 
capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility and we had borrowing capacity available to us 
we have had no borrowings outstanding under this facility during fiscal  or our capital expenditures are estimated to range between approximately  to  for fiscal  with the actual amount depending upon actual operating results and the phasing of certain projects 
such expenditures may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
this range of capital expenditures includes approximately  related to an expansion of our molecular diagnostic manufacturing capacity in cincinnati  ohio 

table of contents known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations uncertain income tax positions liability and interest total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in ohio  massachusetts  florida  australia  belgium  france  holland  germany and the uk  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
as of september   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 
other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to approximately  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the diagnostics segment 
off balance sheet arrangements except for the operating lease arrangements noted above  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions from our operations outside the united states  as well as certain suppliers to our domestic businesses located outside the united states 
the foreign currencies where we have market risk exposure are the australian dollar  the british pound  the euro  and the singapore dollar 
assessing foreign currency exposures is a component of our overall ongoing risk management process  with such currency risks managed as we believe appropriate 

table of contents concentration of customers products risk our diagnostic segment s sales through two us distributors were of the segment s total sales or of consolidated sales for fiscal our c

pylori product families accounted for of our diagnostics segment s third party sales during fiscal  and of our fiscal consolidated sales 
our life science segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two diagnostics manufacturing customers were of the segment s total sales for fiscal or of our fiscal consolidated sales 
our life science segment has four other significant customers who purchase antigens  antibodies and reagents  which together comprised of the segment s total sales for fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition our revenue is generally recognized from sales when product is shipped and title has passed to the customer 
revenue for the diagnostics segment is reduced at the date of sale for product price adjustments due certain distributors under local contracts 
management estimates accruals for distributor price adjustments based on local contract terms  sales data provided by distributors  estimates of inventories of our products held by distributors  historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to the accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
revenue for our diagnostics segment includes revenue for our illumigene molecular test system 
this system includes an instrument  instrument accessories and test kits 
in markets where the test system is sold via multiple deliverable arrangements ie  the united states  australia  belgium  france  holland and italy  the cost of the instrument and instrument accessories is deferred upon placement at a customer and amortized on a straight line basis into cost of sales over the expected utilization period  generally three years 

table of contents we evaluate whether each deliverable in the arrangement is a separate unit of accounting 
the significant deliverables are an instrument  instrument accessories eg  printer and test kits 
an instrument and instrument accessories are delivered to the customer prior to the start of the customer utilization period  in order to accommodate customer set up and installation 
there is de minimis consideration received from the customer at the time of instrument placement 
we have determined that the instrument and instrument accessories are not a separate unit of accounting because such equipment can only be used to process and read the results from our illumigene diagnostic tests ie  our instrument and test kits function together to deliver a diagnostic test result  and therefore the instrument and instrument accessories do not have standalone value to the customer 
consequently  there is no revenue allocated to the placement of the instrument and instrument accessories 
test kits are delivered to the customer over the utilization period of the instrument  which we estimate has a useful life of three years 
our average customer contract period  including estimated renewals  is at least equal to the estimated three year utilization period 
revenue for the sale of test kits is recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customers 
in markets where the test system is not sold via multiple deliverable arrangements ie  countries other than the united states  australia  belgium  france  holland and italy  the cost of the instrument and instrument accessories is charged to cost of sales at the time of shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue for the sales of instruments and instrument accessories and test kits is recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customers 
in these markets  our illumigene molecular test system is sold to independent distributors who inventory the instruments  instrument accessories and test kits for resale to end users 
our products are generally not subject to a customer right of return except for product recall events under the rules and regulations of the food and drug administration or equivalent agencies outside the united states 
in this circumstance  the costs to replace affected products would be accrued at the time a loss was probable and estimable 
life science revenue for contract services may come from research and development services or manufacturing services  including process development work  or a combination of both 
revenue is recognized based on each of the deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate customer pricing 
depending on the nature of the arrangement  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed  upon completion and acceptance by the customer  or upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf  clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis 
no such bill and hold arrangements existed at september   or 
table of contents inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out fifo basis for substantially all of our inventories 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
we estimate these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from these analyses 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal  or indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  we also make judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
we consider the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies  and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets and other long lived assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 

table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
we assess the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our non us subsidiaries are considered by us to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the lapsing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the internal revenue service issued treasury decision  which enacted final tax regulations regarding the capitalization and expensing of amounts paid to acquire  produce  or improve tangible property 
the regulations also include guidance regarding the retirement of depreciable property 
the regulations are required to be effective in taxable years beginning on or after january   although taxpayers may choose to apply them in taxable years beginning on or after january  the company is currently assessing the impact of the final regulations on its financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  to improve the transparency of reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
specifically  the new amendments to asu no 
will require  depending upon the items being reclassified  the i presentation either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes of the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  and or ii the cross reference to other disclosures currently required under us gaap that provide additional detail about such items 
these requirements are effective prospectively for the company beginning october   and we do not expect their adoption to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position
