we also provide medical products to patients in the home 
our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal  and are to the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
except as otherwise specified  information in this form k is provided as of june  pharmaceutical segment in the united states  including puerto rico  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical  over the counter healthcare and consumer products through its pharmaceutical distribution division to retailers including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers  hospitals and other healthcare providers 
this division maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers  renders services to pharmaceutical manufacturers including distribution  inventory management  data reporting  new product launch support  and contract pricing and chargeback administration  franchises retail pharmacies under the medicine shoppe and medicap brands  and provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities  operates nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities through its nuclear pharmacy services division that manufacture  prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and physician offices  and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products  provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party payors and healthcare providers supporting the marketing  distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products  and operates a specialty pharmacy through its specialty solutions division 
in china  the pharmaceutical segment distributes branded  generic and specialty pharmaceuticals  over the counter and consumer products as well as provides logistics  marketing and other services and operates specialty pharmacies through cardinal health china 
pharmaceutical distribution our pharmaceutical distribution division generates gross margin when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost of products sold  net of cash discounts 
gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements 
margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products 
our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time  although this may vary 
margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation 
bulk and non bulk sales the pharmaceutical segment historically has differentiated between bulk and non bulk sales based on the nature of our customers operations when presenting information on the segment operations 
the table below shows the pharmaceutical segment revenue  segment expenses  segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non bulk sales in millions non bulk sales revenue from non bulk sales segment expenses allocated to non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales segment profit from non bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from non bulk sales bulk sales revenue from bulk sales segment expenses allocated to bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales segment profit from bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales segment expenses and profit required complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions  past experience and judgment that we believe were reasonable 
bulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses in the united states 
all other sales were classified as non bulk 
sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and non bulk sales with respect to its retail stores 
substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer  a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping 
in contrast  non bulk sales required more complex servicing 
for non bulk sales  we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities  warehoused the product for a longer period of time  picked individual products specific to a customer s order and delivered that smaller order to a customer location 
bulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales 
customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than non bulk sales  as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers  and hence  less costs were incurred by us in providing these products 
in addition  bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than non bulk sales due to the mix of products sold 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries within the bulk category 
segment distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from non bulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than non bulk sales 
in light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co 
walgreens  we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future 
as such  in the future  we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and non bulk sales to investors 
specialty pharmaceutical products and services we refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as specialty pharmaceutical products and services 
the specialty solutions division currently distributes oncology  rheumatology  urology and other pharmaceutical products specialty pharmaceutical products to physician offices  distributes human plasma products and some specialty pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers  provides various consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party payors and healthcare providers primarily supporting the marketing  distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products  and operates a specialty pharmacy

item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
these are not the only risks we face 
our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations 
we could suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures 
as described in greater detail in item business above  we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
because of competition  our businesses face continued pricing pressure from our customers and suppliers 
if we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as effective sourcing and enhanced cost control measures  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years  the healthcare industry has continued to consolidate 
further consolidation among our customers and suppliers including branded pharmaceutical manufacturers could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
cvs caremark corporation is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue 
our sales and credit concentration is significant 
cvs accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal revenue and percent of our gross trade receivable balance at june  while we recently renewed our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with cvs  if cvs does not renew its contracts with us in the future  or terminates its contracts early  defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases of our products  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our contract with walgreens will expire in august and sales to walgreens accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal revenue 
we expect the expiration of the walgreens contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations  as discussed below in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our pharmaceutical segment margin may be affected by fewer or less profitable generic pharmaceutical launches  prices established by manufacturers and other factors that are beyond our control 
as described in greater detail in item business above  margin in our pharmaceutical segment consists  in part  of margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and branded pharmaceutical price appreciation 
the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches varies from year to year  and the margin impact of new launches varies from product to product 
fewer generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those previously experienced will have an adverse effect on our year over year margins 
additionally  prices for existing generic pharmaceuticals generally decline over time  although this may vary 
price deflation on existing generic pharmaceuticals will have an adverse effect on our margins 
with respect to branded pharmaceutical price appreciation  if branded manufacturers increase prices less frequently or by amounts that are smaller than have been experienced historically  we will earn less margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements 
the us healthcare environment is changing in many ways  some of which may not be favorable to us 
the healthcare industry continues to undergo significant changes designed to increase access to medical care  improve safety  contain costs and increase efficiencies 
medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels have declined  the use of managed care has increased  distributors  manufacturers  healthcare providers and pharmacy chains have consolidated and have formed strategic alliances  and large purchasing groups are prevalent 
the industry also has experienced a shift away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics and office settings  and  in some cases  patients homes 
with respect to cost containment  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act enacted in march have provisions designed to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid  including changing the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement to no less than percent of the average weighted manufacturer price for generic pharmaceuticals 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services is also considering providing states with alternatives to traditional reimbursement measures 
we could be adversely affected directly or indirectly if our customers are adversely affected by these and other changes in the delivery or pricing of  or reimbursement for  pharmaceuticals  medical devices or healthcare services 
our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
as described in greater detail in item business above  we are subject to regulation in the united states at both the federal and state level and in china and other foreign countries 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  or if allegations are made that we fail to comply  our results of operations and 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial condition could be adversely affected 
to lawfully operate our businesses  we are required to hold permits  licenses and other regulatory approvals from  and to comply with operating and security standards of  governmental bodies 
failure to maintain or renew necessary permits  licenses or approvals  or to comply with required standards  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
products that we manufacture  source  distribute or market are required to comply with regulatory requirements 
noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance may result in suspension of our ability to distribute  import or manufacture products  product recalls or seizures  or criminal and civil sanctions 
we are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments  which could result in civil and criminal sanctions  including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
the requirements of these laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices  which may adversely affect our operations  results of operations and financial condition 
assuramed is a medicare certified supplier with respect to a small portion of its business 
its failure to comply with medicare supplier standards and billing requirements could result in civil and criminal sanctions  including the loss of our ability to participate in medicare and other federal and state healthcare programs 
our government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations 
failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with a contractual or other requirement may result in qui tam actions  monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties

our global operations are required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act  chinese anti corruption and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with us and foreign export control  trade embargo and customs laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these laws  we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions 
our china operations are subject to national  regional and local regulations 
the regulatory environment in china is evolving  and officials in the chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations 
it is possible that the chinese government current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our china operations  result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties 
we could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions 
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and many foreign countries 
as a result  we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
from time to time  legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states  such as the repeal of last in  first out lifo treatment of inventory or a change in the current us taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries  that could adversely affect our tax positions  effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
tax laws are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions and it is possible that they will challenge others 
these challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate  tax payments or financial condition 
the carefusion spin off may have unexpected tax consequences 
in connection with the august carefusion spin off  we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that the contribution by us of the assets of the clinical and medical products businesses to carefusion and the distribution of carefusion shares to our shareholders would qualify as a tax free transaction under sections and a d of the internal revenue code the code 
in addition  we received opinions of tax counsel to the effect that the carefusion spin off would qualify as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the irs private letter ruling and the opinions of counsel rely on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from us and carefusion regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel 
similarly  the irs could determine on audit that the carefusion spin off is taxable if it determines that any of the facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel that are not covered by the private letter ruling or for other reasons 
if the carefusion spin off is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes  we and our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities 
our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems and critical facilities 
we rely on information systems to obtain  rapidly process  analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers  receive  process and ship orders on a timely basis  manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers  process payments to suppliers  facilitate the manufacturing and assembly of medical products  and generate financial information 
our business also depends on the proper functioning of our critical facilities  including our national logistics center 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems or facilities  or our customers access to them  are interrupted  damaged by unforeseen events  cyber security incidents or other actions of third parties  or fail for any extended period of time 
in addition  data security breaches could adversely impact our operations  results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal requirements  including those related to patient identifiable health information 

table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries because of the nature of our business  we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 
due to the nature of our businesses  which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products  we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings 
for instance  some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party  subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims 
while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance  it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections 
we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations 
acquisitions can have unanticipated results 
an important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses 
acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition  future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets  or we may encounter unforeseen accounting  internal control  regulatory or compliance issues 
we depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and products 
we depend on the availability of various components  compounds  raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations 
any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  or could be terminated 
a sustained supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business 
our manufacturing businesses use oil based resins  cotton  latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products 
prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs 
prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years  so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated 
due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations  we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices 
if we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions  or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our global operations are subject to economic  political and currency risks 
our global operations are affected by local economic environments  including inflation  recession  currency volatility and competition 
political changes also can disrupt our global operations  as well as our customers and suppliers  in a particular location 
we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks  and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks 
economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services 
deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and  therefore  reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers  which could adversely affect our results of operations

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to plans to sell our united kingdom based martindale injectable manufacturing business within our pharmaceutical segment  and met the criteria for classification of this business as discontinued operations 
as noted above  on august   we completed the distribution to our shareholders of percent of the then outstanding common stock of carefusion 
the distribution of carefusion common stock to our shareholders resulted in the recognition of a billion non cash dividend 

table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented below refers to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are referring to our continuing operations 
overview we are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers  clinical laboratories  physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs  enhancing efficiency and improving quality 
we also provide medical products to patients in the home 
we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medical 
during fiscal  revenue decreased percent to billion  largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts and the impact of brand to generic pharmaceutical conversions 
gross margin increased percent to billion  reflecting strong performance in our pharmaceutical segment generic programs 
operating earnings decreased percent to billion and earnings from continuing operations decreased percent to million due to an million million  net of tax non cash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division 
our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal was driven by acquisitions of billion  share repurchases of million and dividends of million  offset by strong net cash provided by operating activities of billion and net proceeds from long term obligations of million 
we plan to execute a balanced deployment of available capital to position ourselves for sustainable competitive advantage and to enhance shareholder value 
large customers on april   we announced the renewal of our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with cvs 
cvs accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal revenue 
our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens will expire at the end of august because sales to walgreens generated approximately percent of our consolidated revenue for fiscal  we expect the expiration of this contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are taking steps to reduce our costs and otherwise mitigate the impact of the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal and afterward 
largely as a result of the contract expiration  we do not currently expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal  excluding the effects in both periods of restructuring and employee severance costs  acquisition related costs and credits  impairments and gains and losses on disposal of assets including the million nuclear pharmacy services division goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  net litigation recoveries and charges  and charges and tax benefits associated with each of these items 
after the expiration of this contract  we also anticipate a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by reduced accounts payable 
based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors  we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net after tax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal in excess of million 
goodwill in conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   we recently completed our annual goodwill impairment test  which we perform annually in the fourth quarter 
as part of this annual test  we concluded that the entire goodwill amount of our nuclear pharmacy services division was impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million million  net of tax 
this impairment charge does not impact our liquidity  cash flows from operations  or compliance with debt covenants 
the majority of the goodwill of our nuclear pharmacy services division was acquired through our acquisition of syncor international corporation in fiscal million of goodwill 
excluding the impact of the impairment charge  we have a total of approximately billion of invested capital in our nuclear pharmacy services division inclusive of the syncor acquisition  accumulated over the past years 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended december   and march   our nuclear pharmacy services division has experienced significant softness in the low energy diagnostics market 
during the second half of fiscal  we experienced sustained volume declines and price erosion for the core  low energy products provided by this division 
in addition  we experienced reduced sales for some existing high energy diagnostic products  slower than expected adoption of new high energy diagnostic products  and recent reimbursement developments that may adversely impact the future growth of these products 
using this information  we adjusted our outlook and long term business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process  which we recently concluded 
this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
restructuring on january   we announced a restructuring plan within our medical segment 
under this restructuring plan  we are moving production of procedure kits from our facility in waukegan  illinois to other facilities and selling property and consolidating office space in waukegan  illinois 
in addition  we reorganized our medical segment and plan to sell our sterilization processes in el paso  texas 
we estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately million on a pre tax basis  of which million was recognized during fiscal of the estimated million remaining costs to be recognized through the end of fiscal  we estimate that approximately million will be employee related costs  million will be facility exit and other costs  and million will be an expected loss on disposal of the property in waukegan  illinois described above 
we have evaluated this property and have determined that at june  it does not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale 
the costs recognized during are classified as restructuring and employee severance and impairments and loss on disposal of assets in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued expect to start realizing cost savings and other benefits from the plan in fiscal acquisitions on march   we completed the acquisition of assuramed for billion  net of cash acquired  in an all cash transaction 
we funded the acquisition through the issuance of billion in fixed rate notes and cash on hand 
the acquisition of assuramed  a provider of medical supplies to homecare providers and patients in the home  expands our ability to serve this patient base 
we expect the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets to be a significant expense in future periods 
excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  this acquisition had a positive impact on operating earnings in fiscal and we expect it to have a positive impact on operating earnings in future periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assuramed acquisition 
other trends within our pharmaceutical segment  we expect continued strength in our generic pharmaceutical programs as well as continued price appreciation from branded pharmaceutical products in fiscal within our medical segment  variability in the cost of commodities such as oil based resins  cotton  latex  diesel fuel and other commodities can have a significant impact on cost of products sold 
although commodity prices fluctuate  we do not expect changes in commodity prices to have a significant impact on our year over year results of operations in fiscal we also expect a continuation of relatively flat procedural based utilization in fiscal results of operations revenue revenue change in millions pharmaceutical medical total segment revenue corporate nm nm total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment revenue for fiscal compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by the expiration on september  of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts approximately billion  the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales 
revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately billion  primarily as a result of brand to generic pharmaceutical conversions 
brand to generic pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than from us 
the decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers approximately billion and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division million 
revenue from bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
bulk sales for fiscal decreased by percent driven primarily by the expiration of our contract with express scripts and brand to generic conversions 
revenue from non bulk sales was billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively 
non bulk sales for fiscal increased by percent driven by growth from new customers 
see item business for more information about bulk and non bulk sales 
in light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens  we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future 
as such  in the future  we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and non bulk sales to investors 
medical segment revenue for fiscal compared to the prior year reflects the benefit of acquisitions million 
fiscal compared to fiscal pharmaceutical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal compared to the prior year by acquisitions billion and increased sales to existing customers billion 
medical segment revenue was positively impacted during fiscal compared to the prior year by increased volume from existing customers million  including the positive impact from sales of self manufactured and private brand products and the transition during the fourth quarter of fiscal of our relationship with carefusion from a fee for service arrangement to a traditional distribution model million 
cost of products sold consistent with the change in revenue  cost of products sold decreased billion percent during fiscal  and increased by billion percent during fiscal see the gross margin discussion below for additional drivers impacting cost of products sold

increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements exclusive of the related volume impact also had a positive impact on gross margin million 
pricing changes  including rebates exclusive of the related volume impact  adversely impacted gross margin million  driven in part by customer and product mix 
the adverse impact of these pricing changes is offset by sourcing programs and other sources of margin 
as a result of significant market softness  gross margin from our nuclear pharmacy services division decreased by million in fiscal the cost of oil based resins  cotton  latex and other commodities used in our medical segment self manufactured products had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin 
as described above  while the expiration of the 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued express scripts contract resulted in lower revenue  it had a slightly unfavorable impact on gross margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal gross margin increased in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs million  including the impact of new product launches and price appreciation on a few specific products  and acquisitions million

segment profit is segment revenue  less segment cost of products sold  less segment sg a expenses 
we do not allocate restructuring and employee severance  acquisition related costs  impairments and loss on disposal of assets  litigation recoveries charges  net  certain investment and other spending to our segments 
these costs are retained at corporate 
investment spending generally includes the first year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses 
we encourage our segments to identify investment projects that will promote innovation and provide future returns 
as approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon executive management  the expenses for such projects are often retained at corporate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment profit 
pharmaceutical segment profit the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal over fiscal were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs and increased margin from branded pharmaceutical distribution agreements 
these benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution pricing changes and significant market softness in our nuclear pharmacy services division 
the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal over fiscal were strong performance in our generic pharmaceutical programs  including the impact of new product launches  and the positive impact of acquisitions  offset by the unfavorable impact of pharmaceutical distribution pricing changes 
segment profit from bulk sales decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and was percent and percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal and  respectively 
segment profit from non bulk sales increased million in fiscal over fiscal and was percent and percent of pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal and  respectively 
the generic pharmaceutical programs discussed above primarily impacted segment profit from non bulk sales 
medical segment profit the principal drivers for the increase in fiscal over fiscal were the positive impact of acquisitions and decreased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured products  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pricing changes  driven in part by customer and product mix 
segment profit was also moderated by softness in procedural based utilization 
the percent excise tax on certain manufactured or imported medical devices that became effective january  had a slightly unfavorable impact on segment profit 
the principal drivers for the decrease in fiscal over fiscal were the increased cost of commodities used in our self manufactured products and an increase in sg a expenses  including the impact of business system investments 
these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product sales mix and increased net sales volume 
corporate as discussed further below  the principal driver for the decrease in corporate in fiscal was an million non cash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division  in addition to other costs not allocated to our segments 
consolidated operating earnings in addition to revenue  gross margin and sg a expenses discussed above  operating earnings were impacted by the following in millions restructuring and employee severance acquisition related costs impairments and loss on disposal of assets litigation recoveries charges  net 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued restructuring and employee severance in addition to other restructuring activities during fiscal  we recognized million of employee related costs and million of facility exit and other costs related to the restructuring within our medical segment 
we also recognized million of employee related costs as part of a restructuring plan within our nuclear pharmacy services division during the fourth quarter of fiscal acquisition related costs acquisition related costs for fiscal included transaction costs associated with the purchase of assuramed million 
additionally  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization during fiscal was primarily due to intangible assets from the acquisition of assuramed 
acquisition related costs for fiscal included income recognized upon adjustment of the contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with the p healthcare acquisition million 
in early fiscal  we terminated and settled the remaining contingent consideration obligation for million 
impairments and loss on disposal of assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized an million million  net of tax non cash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division  as discussed further in the overview section and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our medical segment restructuring plan discussed in note  during fiscal  we recognized an million loss to write down our gamma sterilization assets in el paso  texas to the estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
also during fiscal  we recorded an million write off of commercial software under development within our pharmaceutical segment in connection with our decision to discontinue this project 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write off an indefinite life intangible asset related to the p healthcare trade name 
litigation recoveries charges  net during fiscal  we recognized million of income resulting from settlements of class action antitrust claims in which we were a class member 
earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations in addition to the items discussed above  earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations were impacted by the following earnings before income taxes and discontinued operations change in millions other income  net nm nm interest expense  net gain on sale of investment in carefusion nm nm interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net for fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to billion of notes issued in connection with the assuramed acquisition 
gain on sale of investment in carefusion we recognized million of income during fiscal related to the sale of our investment in carefusion common stock 
provision for income taxes generally  fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within international and united states state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and discrete items 
a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation provision at federal statutory rate state and local income taxes  net of federal benefit foreign tax rate differential nondeductible nontaxable items nondeductible goodwill impairment change in measurement of an uncertain tax position and impact of irs settlements other effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by percentage points million due to the nondeductibility of substantially all of the goodwill impairment which was partially offset by the favorable impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings as a result of an agreement with tax authorities million or percentage points 
fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a settlement of the fiscal and irs audits million or percentage points 
the year over year comparison of the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the release in fiscal of a previously established deferred tax valuation allowance 
ongoing audits the irs is currently conducting audits of fiscal years through we have received proposed adjustments from the irs for fiscal years through related to our transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
the irs has proposed additional taxes of million  excluding penalties and interest 
if this tax ultimately must be paid  carefusion is liable under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the carefusion spin off for million of the total amount 
we disagree with these proposed adjustments  which we are contesting  and have accounted for the unrecognized tax benefits related to them 
the irs had also proposed additional taxes of million  excluding penalties and interest  related to the transfer of intellectual property among subsidiaries of an acquired entity prior to its acquisition by us  for which carefusion would be liable under the tax matters agreement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  carefusion settled 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued this matter with the irs 
we have adjusted the indemnification receivable that we had recorded for this matter 
the settlement has no net impact on our provision for income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we currently believe that  based upon available capital resources cash on hand and access to committed credit facilities and projected operating cash flow  we have adequate capital resources to fund working capital needs  currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  contractual obligations  payments for tax settlements  and current and projected debt service requirements  dividends and share repurchases 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisition of assuramed  which we funded through the issuance of billion in fixed rate notes and cash on hand  in addition to several other small acquisitions  which we funded with cash on hand 
if we decide to engage in one or more additional acquisitions  depending on the size and timing of such transactions  we may need to access capital in addition to cash on hand 
cash and equivalents our cash and equivalents balance was billion at june   compared to billion at june  at june   our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality  short term liquid investments 
the decrease in cash and equivalents during fiscal was driven by acquisitions of billion  share repurchases of million and dividends of million  offset by strong net cash provided by operating activities of billion and net proceeds from long term obligations of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion was driven primarily by increased gross margin  product mix and working capital changes 
as expected  this increase was partially offset by the adverse impact of cash tax payments and the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts 
during fiscal  we deployed million of cash on share repurchases  million on dividends  million on capital expenditures and million on acquisitions 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds from long term obligations of million 
during fiscal  we deployed billion of cash on acquisitions  million on capital expenditures  million on dividends and million on share repurchases 
during fiscal  we received million in proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in carefusion common stock 
we use days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and days payable outstanding dpo to evaluate our working capital performance 
dso is calculated as trade receivables  net divided by quarterly revenue divided by days 
dioh is calculated as inventories  net divided by quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings divided by days 
dpo is calculated as accounts payable divided by quarterly cost of products sold plus chargeback billings divided by days 
chargeback billings are the difference between a product s wholesale acquisition cost and the contract price 
chargeback billings were billion  billion and billion for fiscal  and  respectively 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our method of calculating dso in order to align it with the day convention that we use in the calculation of dioh and dpo 
prior to this change  we calculated dso by dividing trade receivables  net by monthly revenue divided by days 
in connection with this change  we have revised prior year information to conform to the new method of calculating dso 
days sales outstanding days inventory on hand days payable outstanding changes in working capital can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of inventory purchases  customer payments of accounts receivable and payments to vendors in the regular course of business 
dso and dioh increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts 
dpo increased primarily due to the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts and brand to generic conversions 
dso increased in fiscal over fiscal due to the implementation of our medical segment business transformation project  which led to an increase in trade receivables at june  dioh increased in fiscal as a result of inventory increases related to on boarding a new pharmaceutical customer and our medical segment business transformation project implementation 
the cash and equivalents balance at june  included million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states 
although the vast majority of this cash is available for repatriation  permanently bringing the money into the united states could trigger us federal  state and local income tax obligations 
as a us parent company  we may temporarily access cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without becoming subject to us federal income tax through intercompany loans 
after the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal  we anticipate a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by reduced accounts payable 
based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors  we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net after tax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal in excess of million 
credit facilities and commercial paper our sources of liquidity include a billion revolving credit facility and a million committed receivables sales facility program 
at times  availability under our committed receivables sales facility program may be less than million based on receivables concentration limits and our outstanding eligible receivables balance 
we also have a commercial paper program of up to billion  backed by the revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings from the commercial paper program and no outstanding balance under the committed receivables sales facility program at june  and we also had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at june  and  except for million and million  respectively  of standby letters of credit for each year 
our revolving credit facility and committed receivables sales facility program require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio  as of any fiscal quarter end  of at least to and a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than to as of june   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
on november   we renewed our million committed 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued receivables sales facility program until november  following the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens  we expect that availability under our committed receivables sales facility program will be less than million based on our then outstanding eligible receivables balance

no amounts were drawn under the facility and we terminated the commitment letter in connection with the notes offering 
capital expenditures capital expenditures during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively  which were primarily related to information technology projects 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be between million and million 
dividends during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends totaling per share  an increase of percent from fiscal on may   our board of directors approved a percent increase in our quarterly dividend to per share  or per share on an annualized basis  payable on july  to shareholders of record on july  on august   our board of directors approved our th consecutive regular quarterly dividend  payable to shareholders of record on october  share repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased million of our common shares 
we funded the repurchases with cash on hand 
at june   we had million remaining under our current repurchase authorization which expires august  interest rate and currency risk management we use interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability

our methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic  business and market trends 
in addition  the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate 
we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe 
the following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years in millions  except percentages allowance for doubtful accounts reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write offs charged to costs and expenses allowance as a percentage of customer receivables allowance as a percentage of revenue a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and finance notes receivables at june   would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of million 
we believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal are appropriate 
at this time  we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue 
inventories a substantial portion of our inventories percent and percent at june  and  respectively are valued at the lower of cost  using the lifo method  or market 
these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment 
the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory 
prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise  which results in an increase in cost of products sold  whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline  which results in a decrease in cost of products sold 
the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold  so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue 
using lifo  if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time  so our older inventory is held at a lower cost 
conversely  if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline  future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time  so our older inventory is held at a higher cost 
we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities 
accordingly  the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities  the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal or primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline  inventories valued at lifo were million and million higher than the average cost value as of june  and  respectively 
we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost 
as such  we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal and inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were million and million at june  and  respectively 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience  sales trends  specific categories of inventory and age of on hand inventory 
if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  including identifiable intangible assets  are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets  discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows  and estimates of useful lives 
when an acquisition involves contingent consideration  we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date 
the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results  discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios 
subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of 
table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  trademarks and patents  and non compete agreements  are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount 
this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value  then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill 
we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination 
goodwill impairment testing involves judgment  including the identification of reporting units  the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and  if necessary  the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component 
we have two operating segments  which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical 
these operating segments are comprised of divisions components  for which discrete financial information is available 
components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics 
our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china pharmaceutical division  nuclear pharmacy services division  cardinal health china pharmaceutical division  medical operating segment excluding our assuramed division  and assuramed division 
fair value can be determined using market  income or cost based approaches 
our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income based and market based approaches 
under the income based approach  we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts 
we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally developed forecasts 
discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from to percent 
under the market based approach  we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets 
to further confirm fair value  we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results 
the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment 
we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal  and and  with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division  concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
for our fiscal and testing  we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment 
if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by percent  there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal  or as discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized an million million  net of tax non cash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division  which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business  our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes 
these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed 
at any given time  there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution 
in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors  we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims 
we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review 
though the transaction types are relatively consistent  we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience 
changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made 
vendor reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
approximately percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to percent at the end of fiscal the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period to period  timing of settlements  and specific vendor issues  such as bankruptcies 
the ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment 
we believe  however  that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstances 
provision for income taxes our income tax expense  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents cardinal health  inc and subsidiaries financial review continued deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the following table presents information about our tax position at june in millions net deferred income tax assets net deferred income tax liabilities net loss and credit carryforwards included in net deferred income tax assets net valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets this valuation allowance primarily relates to federal  state and international loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after applying the valuation allowances  we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease million for fiscal share based compensation share based compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model 
we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions 
we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model 
the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years 
as required  the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates

these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange  interest rate and commodity price related changes 
we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to these market exposures which employs operational  economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity by nature of our global operations  our businesses are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation 
these exposures are transactional and translational in nature 
principal drivers of this foreign exchange exposure include the canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  european euro  mexican peso  thai baht  malaysian ringgit and japanese yen 
transactional exposure our businesses transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
as part of our risk management program  at the end of each fiscal year we perform a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year 
these analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program  which mitigates our businesses transactional exposure

our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management 
we utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements 
as part of our risk management program  we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year
