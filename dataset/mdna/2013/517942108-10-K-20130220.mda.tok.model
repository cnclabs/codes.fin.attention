the company evaluates the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions using these metrics discussed above to determine each portfolio hotel s contribution or acquisition hotel s potential contribution toward reaching the company s goals of providing income to its shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and increasing long term total returns to shareholders through appreciation in the value of its common shares 
the company invests in capital improvements throughout the portfolio to continue to increase the competitiveness of its hotels and improve their financial performance

please refer to non gaap financial measures below for a detailed discussion of the company s use of ffo and ebitda and a reconciliation of ffo and ebitda to net income  a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap measurement 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and their subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest  including joint ventures 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has used the information available including the company s past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
revenue recognition the company recognizes hotel operating revenues on an accrual basis consistent with hotel operations 
for retail operations  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lives of the retail leases 
revenue from retail operations is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

table of contents investment in hotel properties upon acquisition  the company determines the fair value of the acquired long lived assets  assumed debt and any intangible assets or liabilities 
the company s investments in hotel properties are carried at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings  years for building improvements  the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related tenant lease for tenant improvements  years for land improvements  years for golf course land improvements  years for swimming pool assets and to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
for investments subject to land and building leases that qualify as capital leases  assets are recorded at the estimated fair value of the right to use the leased property at acquisition and depreciated over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the respective lease 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives and classification of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company change the expected useful life or classification of particular assets  it would result in a change in depreciation expense and annual net income 
the company reviews each hotel for impairment at the end of each reporting period or as events and circumstances dictate throughout the year 
a property is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying amount of a property 
at the end of each reporting period  the company assesses whether any quantitative or qualitative triggering events have occurred in relation to a property 
examples of situations considered to be triggering events include a substantial decline in operating cash flows during the period  including declines related to decreased occupancy  adr or revpar  a current or projected loss from operations  a significant cost accumulation above the original acquisition development estimate  a change in plan to sell the property prior to the end of its useful life or holding period  a significant decrease in market price not in line with general market trends  and any other quantitative or qualitative events deemed significant by our management or our board of trustees 
if the presence of one or more triggering events as described above is identified at the end of a reporting period or throughout the year with respect to a hotel  the company performs a recoverability test 
in doing so  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated remaining holding period is compared to the carrying amount of the hotel 
if the results of a recoverability analysis indicate that the carrying amount of a hotel exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is indicated 
upon presentation to and discussion with the board of trustees  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the hotel over the fair value 
when performing a recoverability test or estimating the fair value of a property  the company makes certain assumptions including  but not limited to  consideration of projected operating cash flows considering factors such as booking pace  growth rates  occupancy  room rates  property specific operating costs and future capital expenditures  projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel based upon our estimation of a property specific capitalization rate  property specific discount rates  and comparable selling prices 
in accordance with gaap guidance  the company considers a hotel as held for sale when a contract for sale is entered into  a substantial non refundable deposit has been received from the purchaser and sale is expected to occur within one year 
the company accounts for profit recognition in accordance with gaap guidance 
upon sale of a hotel  the company determines its profit from the sale under the full accrual method provided the following applicable criteria are met a sale is 
table of contents consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  the company s receivable  if applicable  is not subject to future subordination  the company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and the company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
if all of these conditions are met  the company will recognize the profit on the sale 
share based compensation from time to time  the company awards nonvested shares under the equity incentive plan plan as compensation to officers  employees and non employee trustees 
the shares vest over three to nine years 
the company recognizes compensation expense for nonvested shares on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon the fair value of the shares on the date of issuance  adjusted for forfeitures

table of contents non gaap financial measures ffo and ebitda the company considers the non gaap measures of ffo and ebitda to be key supplemental measures of the company s performance and should be considered along with  but not as alternatives to  net income or loss as a measure of the company s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most real estate industry investors consider ffo and ebitda to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
the white paper on ffo approved by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
in october and november  nareit issued guidance reaffirming its view that impairment write downs of depreciable real estate should be excluded from the computation of ffo 
accordingly  the company recast ffo for the year ended december  to exclude loss on impairment of properties  providing a consistent presentation of ffo measures 
the company computes ffo consistent with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
with respect to ffo  the company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
with respect to ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization  and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  even though ebitda also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo and ebitda are not measures of the company s liquidity  nor are ffo and ebitda indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
these measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties 
to compensate for this  management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the company s operating performance

off balance sheet arrangements reserve funds for future capital expenditures certain of the company s agreements with its hotel managers  franchisors and lenders have provisions for the company to provide funds  generally to of hotel revenues  sufficient to cover the cost of a certain non routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels and b replacements and renewals to the hotels capital assets 
certain of the agreements require that the company reserve this cash in separate accounts 
as of december   the company held million of restricted cash reserves  million of which was available for future capital expenditures 
the company has sufficient cash on hand and availability on its credit facilities to cover capital expenditures under agreements that do not require that the company separately reserve cash 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is the operating cash flow from the company s hotels 
additional sources of cash are the company s senior unsecured credit facility  lhl s unsecured credit facility  additional unsecured financing  secured financing on one or all of the company s unencumbered properties as of december   the sale of one or more properties  equity issuances available under the company s shelf registration statement and the issuance of up to million of common shares from time to time under the agreement see equity issuances and redemptions below 
lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
payments to the operating partnership are required pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and the operating partnership relating to the properties owned by the operating partnership and leased by lhl 
lhl s ability to make rent payments to the operating partnership and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessees ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include adverse effects of weak national  regional and local economic conditions  tightening credit standards  competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition and pricing pressures from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs  including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy  due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lockouts that may impact operating performance  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  and 
table of contents terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings  military actions  pandemics or other medical events which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues which could adversely affect lhl s ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and ultimately impact the company s liquidity 
the company s senior unsecured credit facility  lhl s unsecured credit facility and the company term loans contain certain financial covenants relating to net worth requirements  debt ratios and fixed charge coverage and other limitations that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our shareholders upon events of default 
there are currently no other contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the operating partnership 
failure to comply with our financial covenants contained in our credit facilities  term loans and non recourse secured mortgages could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
if we violate the financial covenants contained in any of our credit facilities or term loans  we may attempt to negotiate waivers of the violations or amend the terms of the applicable credit facilities or term loans with the lenders thereunder  however  we can make no assurance that we would be successful in any such negotiations or that  if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments  such amendments or waivers would be on terms attractive to us 
if a default under any of the above debt instruments were to occur  we would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities  or additional equity financings 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  including upon maturity of the debt  we may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses that reduce cash flow from operating activities 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  increases in interest expense would lower our cash flow  and  consequently  cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants  current on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under the credit facilities  term loans  bonds payable or mortgage loans 
one of the mortgaged properties is currently subject to a cash trap as a result of the impact of a recent renovation on hotel operations

derivative and hedging activities the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of hedging instruments are reported in other comprehensive income loss ocl

as of december   there was million in cumulative unrealized loss  of which million was included in aocl and an immaterial amount was attributable to noncontrolling interests

on march   the company repaid without fee or penalty the hilton san diego gaslamp quarter mortgage loan in the amount of million plus accrued interest through borrowings on its senior unsecured credit facility 
the loan was due to mature in july the mortgage loans contain debt service coverage ratio tests related to the mortgaged properties 
if the debt service coverage ratio for a specific property fails to exceed a threshold level specified in the mortgage  cash flows from that hotel may automatically be directed to the lender to i satisfy required payments  ii fund certain reserves required by the mortgage and iii fund additional cash reserves for future required payments  including final payment 
cash flows may be directed to the lender cash trap until such time as the property again complies with the specified debt service coverage ratio or the mortgage is paid off 

table of contents financial covenants failure to comply with our financial covenants contained in our credit facilities  term loans and non recourse secured mortgages could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
if the company violates the financial covenants contained in any of its credit facilities or term loans described above  the company may attempt to negotiate waivers of the violations or amend the terms of the applicable credit facilities or term loans with the lenders thereunder  however  the company can make no assurance that it would be successful in any such negotiations or that  if successful in obtaining waivers or amendments  such amendments or waivers would be on terms attractive to the company 
if a default under the credit facilities or term loans were to occur  the company would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities  or additional equity financings 
if the company is unable to refinance its debt on acceptable terms  including at maturity of the credit facilities  it may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses that reduce cash flow from operating activities 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  increases in interest expense would lower the company s cash flow  and  consequently  cash available for distribution to its shareholders 
a cash trap associated with a mortgage loan may limit the overall liquidity for the company as cash from the hotel securing such mortgage would not be available for the company to use 
if the company is unable to meet mortgage payment obligations  including the payment obligation upon maturity of the mortgage borrowing  the mortgage securing the specific property could be foreclosed upon by  or the property could be otherwise transferred to  the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company

fair value measurements in evaluating fair value  gaap outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data observable inputs and a reporting entity s own assumptions about market data unobservable inputs 
the hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs used to determine fair value  which are then classified and disclosed in one of the three categories 
the three levels are as follows level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level observable inputs  other than quoted prices included in level  such as interest rates  yield curves  quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by limited market activity 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques when observable inputs are not available 
the company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies the company believes to be appropriate for these purposes 
considerable judgment and subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and  accordingly  such estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be realized upon disposition 

table of contents recurring measurements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  quantitative disclosure of their fair value is as follows in thousands fair value measurements at december  using significant other observable inputs level description consolidated balance sheet location derivative interest rate instruments accounts payable and accrued expenses the fair value of each derivative instrument is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flows under each arrangement 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative instrument  including the period to maturity  and utilizes observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities  which is classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the company also incorporates credit value adjustments to appropriately reflect each parties nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement  which utilizes level inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads 
however  the company has assessed that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the derivatives 
as a result  the company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
financial instruments not measured at fair value the following table represents the fair value  derived using level inputs  of financial instruments presented at carrying value in the company consolidated financial statements as of december  and in thousands december  december  carrying value estimated fair value carrying value estimated fair value note receivable borrowings under credit facilities term loans bonds payable mortgage loans the company estimates the fair value of its borrowings under credit facilities  term loans  bonds payable and mortgage loans using a weighted average effective interest rate of and as of december  and  respectively

derivatives and hedging activities in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures which may include the use of derivative instruments 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  with offsetting changes recorded to other comprehensive income loss 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recognized as interest expense 
the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements

this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness  if any  incurred after that date 
the company s ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was billion 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring the company s variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
from time to time  the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging contracts 
while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates  they also expose the company to the risks that the other parties to the agreements will not 
table of contents perform  the company could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements  the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under gaap guidance 
as of december   million of the company s aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates  excluding amounts outstanding under the first term loan and second term loan since the company hedged their variable interest rates to fixed interest rates
