item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our historical consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a holding company with operations being conducted by our subsidiaries 
our specialty property and casualty insurance companies are licensed in all states  the district of columbia and the cayman islands 
we generate underwriting profits by providing what we view as specialty insurance products  services and programs not generally available in the marketplace 
while many companies write property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  we believe that few write passenger transportation coverage nationwide and very few write coverage for several of the classes of passenger transportation insurance written by our subsidiaries 
we focus on niche insurance markets where we offer insurance products designed to meet the unique needs of targeted insurance buyers that we believe are underserved by the insurance industry 
these niche markets typically possess what we view as barriers to entry  such as being too small  too remote or too difficult to attract or sustain most competitors 
examples of products that we write for these markets include captive programs for transportation companies that we refer to as our alternative risk transfer art programs of gross premiums written  property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  specialty personal lines  primarily recreational vehicle and commercial vehicle coverage and transportation and general commercial insurance in hawaii and alaska 
we strive to become a market leader in the specialty markets that we choose and serve by offering what we believe are specialized products  excellent customer service and superior claims response 
we write commercial insurance for various sizes of transportation fleets 
because of the number of smaller fleets nationwide  we have more opportunities to write smaller risks than larger ones 
when general economic conditions improve  entrepreneurs are encouraged to start new transportation companies  which typically commence operations as a smaller risk and a potential traditional insurance customer for us 
during periods of economic downturn  smaller risks are more prone to failure due to a decrease in leisure travel and consolidation in the industry 
an increase in the number of larger risks results in more prospective art insurance customers 
we generally do not believe that smaller fleets that generate annual premiums of less than  are large enough to retain the risks associated with participation in one of the art programs we currently offer 
by offering insurance products to all sizes of risks  we believe we have hedged against the possibility that there will be a reduction in demand for the products we offer 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to grow and profit with both traditional and art customers based on our assumptions regarding future economic and competitive conditions 
we generally incur low start up costs for new businesses  typically less than  incurred over several quarters 
we believe our flexible processes and scalable systems  along with controlled increase of businesses  allow us to manage costs and match them with the revenue flow 
the factors that impact our growth rate are consistent across all products 
however  the trends impacting each of these factors may vary from time to time for individual products 
those factors are as follows submissions the increase or decrease in the number of new applications we receive 
this is influenced by the effectiveness of our marketing activities compared to the marketing activities of our competitors in each market 
the change in the number of current policyholders that are available for a renewal quote 
the number of policyholders available for renewal changes based upon the economic conditions impacting our customer groups and the extent of consolidation that may be taking place within the industries we support 

table of contents quotes the change in the percentage of the new applications received that do not receive a quote from us 
we do not quote risks that do not meet our risk selection criteria or for which we have not been provided complete application data 
we refer to this ratio as the declination ratio and an increasing declination ratio usually results in reduced opportunities to write new business 
sales the change in percentage of the quotes we issue that are actually sold 
we refer to this ratio as the hit ratio 
hit ratios are affected by the number of competitors  the prices quoted by these competitors and the degree of difference between the competitors pricing  terms and conditions and ours 
rates the change in our rate structure from period to period 
the rates we file and quote are impacted by several factors including the cost and extent of the reinsurance we purchase  our operating efficiencies  our average loss costs  which reflect the effectiveness of our underwriting  our underwriting profit expectations  and our claims adjusting processes 
the difference between our rates and the rates of our competitors is a primary factor impacting the revenue growth of our established product lines 
product offerings and distribution we operate in multiple markets with multiple distribution approaches to attempt to reduce the probability that an adverse competitive response in any single market will have a significant impact on our overall business 
we also attempt to maintain several new products  product line extensions or product distribution approaches in active development status so we are able to take advantage of market opportunities 
we select from potential new product ideas based on our stated new business criteria and the anticipated competitive response 
acquisition of vanliner group  inc effective july   we and our principal insurance subsidiary  national interstate insurance company niic  completed the acquisition of vanliner group  inc vanliner from unigroup  inc 
unigroup whereby niic acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of vanliner and we acquired certain information technology assets 
as part of this acquisition  unigroup agreed to provide us with comprehensive financial guarantees  including a four and a half year balance sheet guaranty whereby both favorable and unfavorable balance sheet developments inure to unigroup 
through the acquisition of vanliner  niic acquired vanliner insurance company vic  a market leader in providing insurance for the moving and storage industry 
obtaining a presence in this industry was our primary strategic objective associated with the acquisition 
beginning july   vanliner s results are included as part of our transportation component  with the exception of vic s moving and storage group art programs  which are part of our art component 
industry and trends the property casualty p c insurance industry is cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the p c insurance industry s pricing environment first began to stabilize in after several years of soft market conditions  with the industry generating a year over year increase in premiums written for the third consecutive year in the industry s sustained improvement in premiums written was driven by both the exposure base s recovery and the ongoing firming of rates 
while the industry s reported underwriting results through september  were near breakeven a marked improvement compared to the same period in according to available industry data compiled by am best for the first nine months of the industry s full year underwriting performance is expected to mirror the unprofitable levels of due to the impact of superstorm sandy  which caused an estimated billion to billion in losses across the 
table of contents industry during the fourth quarter 
while rates have continued to firm and prices have stabilized  the portion of the p c insurance industry in which we primarily operate faces several unfavorable trends in the coming year such as  but not limited to  continued competitive market conditions  diminishing savings from prior year reserve development  the impact of sluggish economic growth and the continuance of relatively low investment returns 
since our inception in we have placed a consistent emphasis on underwriting profit 
though our combined ratio may fluctuate from year to year  we have exceeded our corporate underwriting profit objective of or lower in four of the last five years by achieving an average gaap combined ratio of over the five year period 
we believe the following factors contribute to our performance  which is consistently above industry standards our business model and bottom line orientation have resulted in disciplined and consistent risk assessment and pricing adequacy 
our ability to attract and retain some of the best transportation companies in the industries we serve both from a financial stability and risk perspective and to insure them directly or through our art programs 
our stable operating expenses which include both commissions and other underwriting expenses and other operating and general expenses on our consolidated statements of income have historically been at or below the revenue growth rate 
while interest rates remained low during  like most of the p c insurance industry  we recorded net realized gains from investments  in large part due to sales of securities to fund our special one time per share dividend in the fourth quarter of we have historically maintained a high quality investment portfolio  focusing primarily on investment grade fixed income investments 
our purchases were concentrated in state and local government obligations muni bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities mbs 
the expected continuance of relatively low investment yields in will create challenges when replacing the investment income generated from maturing investments 
as noted above  the p c insurance industry saw a significant upswing in catastrophe related losses in due to superstorm sandy 
for weather related events such as hurricanes  tornados and hailstorms  we conduct an analysis at least annually pursuant to which we input our in force exposures vehicle values in all states and property limits in hawaii into an independent catastrophe model that predicts our probable maximum loss at various statistical confidence levels 
our estimated probable maximum loss is impacted by changes in our in force exposures as well as changes to the assumptions inherent in the catastrophe model 
hurricane and other weather related events have not had a material negative impact on our past results 
our transportation insurance business in particular is also affected by cost trends that negatively impact profitability such as inflation in vehicle repair costs  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs 
we routinely obtain independent data for vehicle repair inflation  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs and adjust our pricing routines to attempt to more accurately project the future costs associated with insurance claims 
historically  these increased costs have not had a material adverse impact on our results 
of course  we would expect a negative impact on our future results if we fail to properly account for and project for these inflationary trends 
increased litigation of claims may also negatively impact our profitability 
as described below  the average revenue dollar per personal lines policy is significantly lower than typical commercial policies 
profitability in the specialty personal lines component is dependent on proper pricing and the efficiency of underwriting and policy administration 
we have continued to monitor rate levels and have adjusted them during  as warranted 
we continuously strive to improve our underwriting and policy issuance functions to keep this cost element as low as possible by utilizing current technology advances 
to succeed as a transportation underwriter and personal lines underwriter  we must understand and be able to quantify the different risk characteristics of the risks we consider quoting 
certain coverages are more stable and predictable than others and we must recognize the various components of the risks we assume when we write any specific class of insurance business 
examples of trends that can change and  therefore  impact our profitability are loss frequency  loss severity  geographic loss cost differentials  societal and legal factors impacting loss costs such 
table of contents as tort reform  punitive damage inflation and increasing jury awards and changes in regulation impacting the insurance relationship 
any changes in these factors that are not recognized and priced for accordingly will affect our future profitability 
we believe our product management organization provides the focus on a specific risk class needed to stay current with the trends affecting each specific class of business we write 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our insurance policies and income from our investment portfolio 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
as with all p c insurance companies  the impact of price changes is reflected in our financial results over time 
price changes on our in force policies occur as they are renewed  which generally takes twelve months for our entire book of business and up to an additional twelve months to earn a full year of premium at the renewal rate 
insurance rates charged on renewing policies reflected single digit rate increases for the majority of our products in compared to there are distinct differences in the timing of premiums written in traditional transportation insurance compared to the majority of our art insurance component 
we write traditional transportation insurance policies throughout all twelve months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under most art programs  all members of the group share a common renewal date 
these common renewal dates are scheduled throughout the calendar year 
any new art program participant that joins after the common date will be written for other than a full annual term so its next renewal date coincides with the common expiration date of the program it has joined 
historically  most of our group programs had common renewal dates in the first six months of the year  but with the growth from new art programs  we are now experiencing renewal dates throughout the calendar year 
the art component of our business accounted for of total gross premiums written during as compared to in the projected profitability from traditional transportation accounts and transportation art businesses are substantially comparable 
increased investment income opportunities generally are available with traditional insurance  but the lower acquisition expenses and persistence of the art programs generally provide for lower operating expenses from these programs 
the lower expenses associated with our art programs generally offset the projected reductions in investment income potential 
from a projected profitability perspective  we are ambivalent as to whether a transportation operator elects to purchase traditional insurance or one of our art program options 
all of our transportation products  traditional or art  are priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
because traditional insurance tends to have a higher operating expense structure  the portion of the premiums available to pay losses tends to be lower for a traditional insurance quote versus an art insurance quote 
we use a cost plus pricing approach that projects future losses based upon the insured s historic losses and other factors 
operating expenses  premium taxes and a profit margin are then added to the projected loss component to achieve the total premium to be quoted 
the lower the projected losses  expenses and taxes  the lower the total quoted premiums regardless of whether it is a traditional or art program quotation 
quoted premiums are computed in accordance with our approved insurance department filings in each state 
our specialty personal lines products are also priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
the average premium per policy for this business component is significantly less than transportation lines 
we approach investment and capital management with the intention of supporting insurance operations by providing a stable source of income to supplement underwriting income 
the goals of our investment policy are to protect capital while optimizing investment income and capital appreciation and maintaining appropriate liquidity 
we follow a formal investment policy and the board reviews the portfolio performance at least quarterly for compliance with the established guidelines 
in  investment yields were relatively consistent with those experienced in due to the continued low interest rate environment  which contributed to an 
table of contents increase in the fair value of our existing holdings 
we recorded a million pre tax net realized gain on investments in as compared to million recorded in included in these pre tax net realized gains are impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we record losses and lae based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to estimate losses and lae accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions and to a lesser extent premium taxes 
the brokerage and agent commissions are reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written 
other operating and general expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries  benefits and certain costs associated with awards under our equity compensation plans  such as stock compensation expense and other general operating expenses 
our personnel expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expenses associated with outstanding debt and expense on amounts withheld are disclosed separately from operating and general expenses 
we invest funds in the participant loss layer for several of our art programs 
we receive investment income and incur an equal expense on the amounts owed to art participants 
expense on amounts withheld represents investment income that we remit back to art participants 
the related investment income is included in the net investment income line on our consolidated statements of income 
results of operations overview our net income  determined in accordance with gaap  includes items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operations 
the following table identifies such items and reconciles net income to net income from operations  a non gaap financial measure that we believe is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends 
year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share dollars in thousands  except per share data net income from operations after tax net realized gains from investments change in valuation allowance related to net capital losses gain on bargain purchase of vanliner after tax impact from balance sheet guaranty for vanliner net income and results have been retrospectively adjusted for the changes to accounting for deferred policy acquisition costs required under accounting standards update no 
asu 

table of contents our net income for was million per share diluted compared to million per share diluted in  driven by elevated claims results  as our loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  increased percentage points to compared to for the same period in the unfavorable claims results were primarily attributable to higher than average claims severity experienced in two historically profitable products  one in our hawaii and alaska component and one in our art transportation component  as well as adverse claim development from prior years loss reserves 
we expect that these products results in future periods will be more consistent with our historical results 
also contributing to the year over year increase in our loss and lae ratio were the favorable claims results experienced in our higher limit passenger transportation business in  whereas this portion of our business performed more in line with our expectations and its historical run rate during partially offsetting these elevated claims results was the improved performance of our recreational vehicle product in as compared to while we experienced a decline in underwriting profits  we saw our net investment income grow million  or  to million in compared to million  which was primarily due to a shift into higher yielding state and local government obligations and commercial mbs that was concentrated in the second half of unigroup provided us with comprehensive financial guarantees related to the runoff of vanliner s final balance sheet whereby both favorable and unfavorable balance sheet development inures to the seller 
in accordance with purchase accounting requirements we were required to determine the fair value of the future economic benefit of the financial guarantees and acquired loss reserves as of the date of acquisition  despite the fact that certain gains and losses related to the financial guaranty would be reflected in operations as they are incurred in future periods 
as a result  the recognition of the revenues and expenses associated with the guaranteed runoff business will not occur in the same period and will result in combined ratios which are inconsistent with the negotiated combined ratio which was to approximate for the vanliner guaranteed business 
as such  the after tax impact from the runoff business guaranteed by the seller for the years ended december   and have been removed in determining net income from operations to reflect only those results of the ongoing business 
our net income from operations for was million per share diluted compared to million per share diluted in for the year ended december   the loss and lae ratio from ongoing operations  which excludes the impact from the runoff of the guaranteed vanliner business  was compared to for the same period in the primary drivers for this year over year fluctuation are the same as those discussed above for the change in net income for the respective periods 
we recorded after tax net realized gains from investments of million per share diluted in compared to million per share diluted in our after tax net realized gains for the year ended december  were primarily generated by sales of securities  as well as net gains associated with equity partnership investments  while the after tax net realized gains in related primarily to sales of securities  partially offset by net losses associated with equity partnership investments 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a reduction of million per share diluted to our valuation allowance related to net realized losses due to both available tax strategies and the future realizability of previously impaired securities 
no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was necessary subsequent to march  in conjunction with the completion of the vanliner acquisition  we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of million per share diluted as of the july  acquisition date 
the purchase price of the acquisition was based on vanliner s tangible book value 
the fair value of the net assets acquired of million was in excess of the total purchase consideration of million  primarily due to the recognition of certain intangible assets under purchase accounting  an adjustment to record the acquired loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves at fair value  as well as recording management s best estimate of the contingent consideration associated with the balance sheet guaranty 
a gain on bargain purchase is a nontaxable transaction and therefore has not been tax effected in the table above or in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents gross premiums written we operate our business as one segment  property and casualty insurance 
we manage this segment through a product management structure 
the following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by business component during the periods indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other gross premiums written gross premiums written includes both direct premium and assumed premium 
during  our gross premiums written increased million  or  compared to  primarily attributable to our art and transportation components 
gross premiums written in our art component increased by million  or  due to growth in existing art programs including the addition of four new customers to our large account art product  the addition of new customers in many of our other art programs and an increase in exposures on renewal business 
additionally  we continued to experience high levels of member retention in group art programs renewing during the period 
the art growth was partially offset by reductions in premium primarily associated with the impact from our previously reported actions in related to the runoff of one of the products in the program business portion of our art component 
our transportation component grew by million  or  driven by growth in our trucking transportation product  which saw increases in both rates and exposures  as well as the impact from capitalizing on new business opportunities in the gradually improving commercial insurance market 
also contributing to the component s growth were vanliner s moving and storage products which grew due to a combination of rate increases and the addition of new customers during the year 
the decrease of million  or  in our specialty personal lines component is primarily related to the decline in our recreational vehicle product due to the continued trend toward recreational vehicle owners going directly to insurance companies for quotes versus using an agent 
our group art programs  which focus on specialty or niche businesses  provide various services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention and reinsurance placement  along with providing various types of property and casualty insurance coverage 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to companies with similar risk profiles and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
as part of our art programs  we have analyzed  on a quarterly basis  members loss performance on a policy year basis to determine if there would be a premium assessment to participants or if there would be a return of premium to participants as a result of less than expected losses 
assessment premium and return of premium are recorded as adjustments to premiums written assessments increase premiums written  returns of premium reduce premiums written 
for the year ended december   we recorded a premium assessment of million  as compared to returns of premium of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the million decline in our specialty personal lines component was primarily due to the decrease in premiums written in our recreational vehicle product experienced throughout and  as well as the impact of the previously reported pricing and underwriting actions associated with our commercial vehicle product which continued into the million decline in our transportation component was driven by a million decrease related to the runoff of vanliner s premiums earned associated with the business covered by the balance sheet guaranty

table of contents our transportation component increased million  or  in compared to the same period in mainly due to vanliner s moving and storage products 
approximately million of the vanliner premiums earned relate to the runoff of the business covered by the balance sheet guaranty 
these increases were partially offset by our specialty personal lines component  which decreased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the decline in premiums written in our commercial vehicle and recreational vehicle products experienced throughout underwriting and loss ratio analysis underwriting profitability  as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings  is measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
losses and lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to accurately estimate losses and lae at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
our underwriting expense ratio includes commissions and other underwriting expenses and other operating and general expenses  offset by other income 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written and  to a lesser extent  premium taxes 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forego volume as a result 
after several years of modest single digit decreases in rate levels on our renewal business as a whole  beginning in and continuing throughout  we saw rate levels begin to stabilize on renewal business  with a number of our products experiencing single digit rate level increases on renewal business

we expect that these products results in future periods will be more consistent with our historical results 
however  we will continue to closely monitor the products performance and will respond with rate increases or non renewals  as necessary 
also contributing to the year over year increase in our loss and lae ratio were the favorable claims results experienced in our higher limit passenger transportation business in  whereas this portion of our business performed more in line with our expectations and its historical run rate during partially offsetting these elevated claims results was the improved performance of our recreational vehicle product in as compared to for the year ended december   we had unfavorable development from prior years loss reserves of million  or percentage points  compared to favorable development of million  or percentage points  for the same period in this unfavorable development was primarily related to settlements above the established case reserves and revisions to our estimated future settlements on an individual case by case basis

at december   we had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on equity securities 
our investment portfolio allocation is based on diversification among primarily high quality fixed maturity investments and guidelines in our investment policy 
fixed maturity investments are focused on securities with intermediate term maturities 
at december   the weighted average maturity of our fixed maturity investments was approximately years 
at december   of the fixed maturities in our portfolio were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies 
investment grade securities generally bear lower degrees of risk and corresponding lower yields than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
although we cannot provide any assurances  we believe that  in normal market conditions  our high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
included in the fixed maturities at december  were million of residential mbs 
we do not have a significant exposure to the subprime lending sector and of our residential mbs are backed by us government agencies 
mbs are subject to prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be prepaid more rapidly than scheduled as buyers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of declining interest rates 
also included in fixed maturities at december  were million of state and local government obligations muni bonds  which represented approximately of our fixed maturity portfolio  with approximately million  or  of our state and local government obligations held in special revenue obligations  and the remaining amount held in general obligations 
our state and local government obligations portfolio is high quality  as of such securities were rated investment grade at december  and approximately of our muni bonds are rated a or better and the average credit quality is aa 
we had no state and local government obligations for any state  municipality or political subdivision that comprised or more of the total amortized cost or fair value of such obligations at december

the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than temporary impairment

the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
we are responsible for the valuation process and use data from outside sources including nationally recognized pricing services and broker dealers in establishing fair value 
pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate the fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis 
these inputs include  but are not limited to  recent reported trades  benchmark yields  issuer spreads  bids or offers  reference data and measures of volatility 
included in the pricing of mbs are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral 
inputs from brokers and independent financial institutions include  but are not limited to  yields or spreads of comparable investments which have recent trading activity  credit quality  duration  credit enhancements  collateral value and estimated cash flows based on inputs including  delinquency rates  estimated defaults and losses  and estimates of the rate of future prepayments 
valuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by our internal investment professionals  as well as investment professionals affiliated with american financial group  inc  who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price 
to validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained  our investment professionals  who report to the chief investment officer  compared the valuation received to an independent third party pricing source and considered widely published indices as benchmarks  recent trades  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers 
if we believe that significant discrepancies exist  we will perform additional procedures  which may include specific inquiry of the pricing service  to resolve the discrepancies 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the security  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar securities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are not active and observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rate and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
level consists of publicly traded equity securities and highly liquid  direct obligations of the us government whose fair value is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose fair value is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active and include us government agency securities  fixed maturity investments  and perpetual preferred stocks that are not actively traded

level consists of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market  whose fair value is estimated by management based on inputs from independent financial institutions  which include non binding broker quotes  which we believe reflect fair value  but for which we are unable to verify inputs to the valuation methodology 
we obtained at least one quote or price per instrument from brokers and pricing services for all level securities and did not adjust any quotes or prices obtained 
management reviews these broker quotes using any recent trades  if such information is available  or market prices of similar investments 
we primarily use the market approach valuation technique for all investments 
liquidity and capital resources capital ratios 
the national association of insurance commissioners model law for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december  and  the capital and surplus of all our insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds 
the liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and payments of dividends and taxes to us from insurance subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided sufficient funds to meet these requirements  without requiring significant liquidation of investments 
if our cash flows change dramatically from historical patterns  for example as a result of a decrease in premiums  an increase in claims paid or operating expenses  or financing an acquisition  we may be required to sell securities before their maturity and possibly at a loss 
our insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments or cash and cash equivalents to meet their liquidity needs 
our historic pattern of using receipts from current premium writings for the payment of liabilities incurred in prior periods provides us with the option to extend the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of our loss reserves 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an million increase from december  for  and  we generated consolidated cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in cash flow from operations in from is primarily attributable to a decrease in claim payments related to the runoff of the guaranteed vanliner reserves and lower estimated federal income tax payments made during as compared to estimated tax payments made during the included million associated with the vanliner acquisition included in the line item increase decrease in accounts payable  commissions and other liabilities and assessments and fees payable on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   which was offset by cash received of an equal amount included in collection of amounts refundable on the purchase price of vanliner in the investing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  
cash flow from operations decreased million in from primarily attributable to a large amount of claims payments made during related to the guaranteed vanliner business 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this million increase in cash provided by investing activities in  as compared to  was primarily driven by funding our one time special per share dividend payment in december  as we generated cash for the dividend from matured or sold investments versus reinvesting the cash in other investment securities 
among the significant changes in net cash provided by 
table of contents investing activities in compared to were decreases in purchases of fixed maturity investments and equity securities of million and million  respectively  partially offset by a million decrease in the proceeds from maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity investments and a million decrease in the proceeds from sales of fixed maturities 
in addition to providing liquidity to fund our one time special dividend  the decreases in investment activity in were due to a large number of securities obtained as part of the vanliner acquisition maturing and being subsequently reinvested in the net purchases of fixed maturities during the year ended december  were primarily concentrated in state and local government obligations and commercial mbs  while the net sales of equity securities during the period were primarily concentrated in exchange traded funds and common stocks 
the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in  as compared to  was primarily related to a million decrease in the purchases of fixed maturity investments  a million increase in the proceeds from sales of fixed maturity investments  the net cash outflow associated with the acquisition of vanliner of million in and receiving the million refund in on the purchase price of vanliner related to making the election under section h of the internal revenue code and the finalization of the tangible book value  which were partially offset by a million decrease in the proceeds from maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity investments and million from the purchase of equity investments 
the decreases in the purchases of fixed maturities and the proceeds from maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity investments in as compared to the prior period were primarily due to the positioning of our portfolio which took place during the first six months of to generate funds to finance the vanliner acquisition and the subsequent investment of vanliner s million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in the third quarter of the increase in the proceeds from sales of fixed maturity investments was driven by the repositioning of our portfolio in to take advantage of higher yielding securities and locking in capital gains on current holdings 
the net purchases of fixed maturities during were primarily concentrated in residential mbs and state and local government obligations 
the net purchases of equity securities during were mainly concentrated in stocks of blue chip companies with histories of strong dividend payouts 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the million increase in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared to  was primarily due to our one time special per share dividend payment in december totaling million 
also contributing to the increase in net cash used in financing actives was a million reduction in the net borrowings on our credit facility during as compared to the million increase in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared to  was primarily driven by a million reduction in the net borrowings on our credit facility during as compared to under tax allocation and cost sharing agreements among the company and its subsidiaries  taxes and expenses are allocated among the entities 
the federal income tax provision of our individual subsidiaries is computed as if the subsidiary filed a separate tax return 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from us 
on november   we replaced our million credit agreement with a million unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement that terminates in november  which includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
we have the ability to increase the line of credit to million subject to the credit agreement s accordion feature 
amounts borrowed bear interest at either a libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on our am best insurance group rating  or a rate per annum equal to the greater of a the administrative agent s prime rate  b in excess of the federal funds effective rate  or c in excess of the one month libor rate 
based on our am best insurance group rating of a at december   we would pay interest at the libor rate plus 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit agreement  with the interest rate on this debt equal to the three month libor at december  plus basis points  with interest payments due quarterly 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis  including minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum debt to capital ratio 
in addition  the credit 
table of contents agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for facilities of this type  including negative covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness  effect mergers or consolidations  make investments  enter into asset sales  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates and other restrictions customarily contained in such agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we believe that funds generated from operations  including dividends from insurance subsidiaries  parent company cash and funds available under our credit agreement will provide sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  if these funds are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  we would be required to generate cash through additional borrowings  sale of assets  sale of portfolio securities or similar transactions 
if we were required to sell portfolio securities early for liquidity purposes rather than holding them to maturity  we would recognize gains or losses on those securities earlier than anticipated 
if we were forced to borrow additional funds under our credit agreement in order to meet liquidity needs  we would incur additional interest expense  which could have a negative impact on our earnings 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond a month period is dependent upon factors such as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our long term operating needs 
we are not aware of any trends or uncertainties affecting our liquidity  including any significant future reliance on short term financing arrangements 
off balance sheet items 
we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in applicable sec rules 
we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of loss and lae reserves and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are two areas where by the degree of judgment required in determining amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
we discuss these two policies below 
our other significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies 
loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of that loss to us and our final payment of that loss and its related lae 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of gross loss and lae reserves  representing management s best estimate of the ultimate loss 
management records  on a monthly and quarterly basis  its best estimate of loss reserves 
for purposes of computing the recorded reserves  management utilizes various data inputs  including analysis that is derived from a review of prior quarter results performed by actuaries employed by great american 
in addition  on an annual basis  actuaries from great american review the recorded reserves for niic  vic  niic hi and tcc utilizing current period data and provide a statement of actuarial opinion  required annually in accordance with state insurance regulations  on the statutory reserves recorded by these us insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial analysis of niic s  vic s  niic hi s and tcc s net reserves as of december  and as of december  reflected point estimates that were within of management s recorded net reserves as of such dates 
using this actuarial data along with its other data inputs  management concluded that the recorded reserves appropriately reflect management s best estimates of the liability as of each year end 
the quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves by great american actuaries are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to the case incurred development method  the paid development method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the projected claim count times projected claim severity methods 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail 
generally  the same actuarial methods are considered for both short tail and long tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both 
the methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims 
for short tail lines  management tends to give more weight to the case incurred and paid development methods  although the various methods tend to produce similar results 
for long tail lines  more judgment is involved and more weight may be given to the bornhuetter ferguson method 
liability claims for long tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment 
therefore  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate and whether adjustments are needed to particular methods 
this information includes open and closed claim counts  average case reserves and average incurred on open claims  
table of contents closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages  average closed claim severity  ultimate claim severity  reported loss ratios  projected ultimate loss ratios  and loss payment patterns 
following is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves in our more significant lines of business 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
an unexpected change in cost trends could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
it is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables 
however  it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to a potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables 
the sensitivity of recorded reserves to a potential change of in the future cost trends is shown below 
utilizing the effect of a change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by extrapolation 
the estimated cumulative unfavorable impact that this change would have on our net income is shown below line of business cumulative impact commercial auto liability million workers compensation million the judgments and uncertainties surrounding management s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves for all lines of business have developed 
if our december   reserves net of reinsurance developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years  the effect on net earnings would be an increase of million 
yr 
average development net reserves december  effect on net earnings million million net of tax effect 
the following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae of our two most significant lines of business  which represent of our total reserves and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period 
management has not made changes in key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves based on historical changes or current trends observed 
commercial auto liability 
in this line of business  we provide coverage protecting buses  limousines  other public transportation vehicles and trucks for accidents causing property damage or personal injury to others 
property damage liability and medical payments exposures are typically short tail lines of business with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims 
bodily injury exposure is long tail because although the claim reporting of this line of business is relatively quick  the final settlement can take longer to achieve 

table of contents some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto liability include litigious climate  unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues  magnitude of jury awards  outside counsel costs  and frequency and timing of claims reporting 
we recorded unfavorable development of million  million and million in  and  respectively  for this line of business as actual claim severity was higher than previously anticipated 
we continually monitor development trends in each line of business as a component of estimating future ultimate loss and related lae liabilities 
management has not made any changes to the key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves in the commercial auto liability line of business 
workers compensation 
in this long tail line of business  we provide coverage for employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations  future medical cost inflation  economic conditions  and timing of claims reporting 
we recorded unfavorable prior year loss development of million and million in in  respectively 
we recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in economic conditions over the last couple of years have led to longer duration of claims resulting in higher claim severity 
due to the long tail nature of this business it is difficult to predict ultimate liabilities until a higher percentage of claims have been paid and the ultimate impact of these decisions can be estimated with more precision 
management continues to review the frequency  severity  and loss and lae ratios implied by the indications from the standard tests while considering the uncertainties of future costs in determining the appropriate reserve level 
within each line  great american actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information and input from management to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  a weighted average of several tests or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate and to provide management with a consulting opinion regarding the advisability of modifying its reserve setting assumptions for future periods 
the great american actuaries do not develop ranges of losses 
the level of detail at which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
we generally analyze data by major product or coverage  using countrywide data 
we determine the appropriate segmentation of the data based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business and other actuarial considerations 
point estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
claims we view as potentially significant are subject to a rigorous review process involving the adjuster  claims management and executive management 
we seek to establish reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historic claims experience 
incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserves are determined separate from the case reserving process and include estimates for potential adverse development of the recorded case reserves 
we monitor ibnr reserves monthly with financial management and quarterly with an 
table of contents actuary from great american 
ibnr reserves are adjusted monthly based on historic patterns and current trends and exposures 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of our claims personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
individual case reserves are reviewed for adequacy at least quarterly by senior claims management 
when establishing and reviewing reserves  we analyze historic data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historic loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
as of december   management has not made any key assumptions that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns 
a change in any of these aforementioned factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves 
currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual occurrences 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are increased or strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to income in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a benefit to income in the period that redundancy is recognized 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves 
in  we experienced unfavorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to we did not significantly change our reserving methodology or our claims settlement process in any of these years 
the development reflected settlements that differed from the established case reserves  changes in the case reserves based on new information for that specific claim or the differences in the timing of actual settlements compared to the payout patterns assumed in our accident year ibnr reductions 
the types of coverages we offer and risk levels we retain have a direct influence on the development of claims 
specifically  short duration claims and lower risk retention levels generally are more predictable and normally have less development 
future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past development experience should not be assumed or estimated 
the reserves reported in the financial statements are our best estimate 
the following table shows the breakdown of our gross loss reserves between case reserves estimated amounts required to settle claims that have already been reported  ibnr reserves estimated amounts that will be needed to settle claims that have already occurred but have not yet been reported to us  as well as reserves for

we are also subject to credit risks with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risks to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all these risks 
as a result  reinsurance does not limit our ultimate obligation to pay claims to policyholders and we may not be able to recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we manage this credit risk by selecting what we believe to be quality reinsurers  closely monitoring their financial condition  timely billing and collecting amounts due and obtaining sufficient collateral when necessary 
other than temporary impairment our investments are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation risks 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  economic stability of an entire industry sector or subsection  whether the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss  the extent to which the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data  internally and externally generated financial models and forecasts  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
under current other than temporary impairment accounting guidance  if management can assert that it does not intend to sell an impaired fixed maturity security and it is not more likely than not that it will have to sell the 
table of contents security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  then an entity may separate the other than temporary impairments into two components the amount related to credit losses recorded in earnings and the amount related to all other factors recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit related portion of an other than temporary impairment is measured by comparing a security s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield prior to the impairment charge 
both components are required to be shown in the consolidated statements of income 
if management intends to sell an impaired security  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery  an impairment charge is required to reduce the amortized cost of that security to fair value 
additional disclosures required by this guidance are contained in note investments 
we closely monitor each investment that has a fair value that is below its amortized cost and make a determination each quarter for other than temporary impairment for each of those investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million in earnings primarily due to million in charges on several common stock securities due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of recovery as well as the length of time and the extent to which the securities had been in an unrealized loss position 
the remaining other than temporary impairment is due to a million charge on two perpetual preferred stocks due to the uncertainty and timing of repayment 
during the year ended december   we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million in earnings primarily due to a million charge on one common stock security due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of recovery as well as the length and amount of time the security had been in an unrealized loss position 
the remaining other than temporary impairments were due to a million charge on common stock securities that were likely to be sold in the near future and had unrealized losses prior to the write down and a million charge in earnings on one mbs for which full principal repayment was no longer expected 
the charge on the mbs consisted of both a credit and a non credit other than temporary impairment 
during the year ended december   we recorded credit loss other than temporary impairment charges of million primarily due to a million charge on one corporate bond where management was uncertain of ultimate recovery and as a result the entire impairment was recorded as a credit loss  as well as a million charge recorded on one mbs  for which a previous impairment charge had been recorded in while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  given the inherent uncertainty in the market  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to net income in subsequent quarters 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on our liquidity

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is also exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not entered and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during  the financial markets were relatively stable and interest rates remained at low levels  thereby increasing the value of many of our fixed maturity investments 
as a result of these effects  we had a pre tax unrealized gain of million in our fixed maturities portfolio at december  compared with a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  our equity securities had a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  compared to a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  the fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio is directly impacted by changes in interest rates  in addition to credit risk 
our fixed maturities portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
we believe this practice allows us to be flexible in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
we manage the portfolios of our insurance companies to attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
we invest in a diverse allocation of fixed income securities to capture what we believe are adequate risk adjusted returns in an evolving investment environment
