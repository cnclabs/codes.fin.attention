we were founded in june by a team at deloitte  led by our executive chairman  donald b 
murray  who was then a senior partner with deloitte 
our founders created resources connection to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services 
we operated as a part of deloitte from our inception in june until april in april  we completed a management led buyout in partnership with several investors 
in december  we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the nasdaq stock market 
we currently trade on the nasdaq global select market 
in january  we announced the change of our operating entity name to resources global professionals to better reflect the company s multinational capabilities and during fiscal  we redesigned our logo and adopted the initials rgp for branding and marketing purposes 

table of contents we operated solely in the united states until fiscal year  when we opened our first three international offices and began to expand geographically to meet the demand for project professional services across the world 
as of may   we served clients from offices in countries  including international offices and offices in the united states 
we expect to continue opportunistic domestic and multinational expansion while also investing in complementary professional services lines that we believe will augment our service offerings 
we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented of our revenue for each of the years ended may   may  and may  we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts  if any  is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional consultants and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our consultants on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our consultants as they are earned 
these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a discretionary bonus plan  subsidized group health  dental and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s espp  and professional development and career training 
in addition  we pay the related costs of employment  including state and federal payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance  unemployment insurance and other costs 
typically  a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of the benefits 
we recognize direct cost of services when incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the payroll and related costs of our internal management as well as general and administrative  marketing and recruiting costs 
our sales and marketing efforts are led by our management team who are salaried employees and earn bonuses based on operating results for the company as a whole and within each individual s geographic market 
the company s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the saturday in may closest to may fiscal and consisted of weeks each 
for fiscal years of weeks  such as next year s fiscal  the first three quarters consist of weeks each and the fourth quarter consists of weeks 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not subject to periodic amortization 
these assets are considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 
contingent consideration the company estimates and records the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of purchase price consideration for acquisitions occurring subsequent to may  in addition  each reporting period  the company estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and any change in fair value is recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results  discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential operating result scenarios 
future revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 

table of contents under the terms of a november membership interest purchase agreement that we entered into with sitrick and company  michael s 
sitrick  brincko associates  inc and john p 
brincko together  the sellers to acquire sitrick brincko group  the sellers have the opportunity to receive contingent consideration subsequent to the fourth anniversary of the acquisition  provided that sitrick brincko group s average annual ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization over a period of four years following the acquisition date exceeds million 
the range of undiscounted amounts the company could be obligated to pay as contingent consideration under the earn out arrangement is between and an unlimited amount 
at the date of acquisition  the company determined the fair value of the obligation to pay contingent consideration based on probability weighted projections of the average ebitda during the four year earn out measurement period 
the resultant probability weighted average ebitda amounts were then multiplied by representing the agreed upon multiple to be paid by the company as specified in the acquisition agreements and then discounted using an original discount rate of 
each reporting period  the company estimates changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and any change in fair value will be recognized as a non cash charge in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the sitrick brincko group earn out liability is based upon an assessment of actual ebitda of the sitrick brincko group through the evaluation date and an updated assessment of various probability weighted projected ebitda scenarios over the remaining earn out period 
as the ultimate estimated liability is also discounted each period from the november earn out date  the contingent consideration liability will fluctuate due to changes in the risk free interest rate used in determining the appropriate discount factor for time value of money purposes 
an increase in the earn out expected to be paid will result in a charge to operations in the quarter that the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration increases  while a decrease in the earn out expected to be paid will result in a credit to operations in the quarter that the anticipated fair value of contingent consideration decreases 
during the fiscal year ended may   the company determined that it was more likely than not that there will not be a contingent consideration payment due in november  and accordingly  reduced the liability and recognized a favorable adjustment to contingent consideration in its consolidated statement of operations for that year 
as of may   the company continues to believe it is more likely than not that there will not be a contingent consideration payment due in november and  accordingly  there is no liability recorded at that date or any adjustment recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  in addition  under the terms of our acquisition agreements for sitrick brincko group  up to of the contingent consideration is payable to employees of the acquired business at the end of the measurement period to the extent certain ebitda growth targets are achieved 
the company records the estimated amount of the contractual obligation to pay the employee portion of the contingent consideration as compensation expense over the service period as it is deemed probable that the growth targets will be achieved 
the estimate of the amount of the employee portion of contingent consideration requires very subjective assumptions to be made of future operating results 
future revisions to these assumptions could materially change our estimate of the amount of the employee portion of contingent consideration and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 
during the fiscal year ended may   the company determined that it was more likely than not that there will not be an employee portion of contingent consideration payment due in november  and accordingly  reduced the liability and recognized a favorable adjustment to employee portion of contingent consideration in its consolidated statement of operations for that year 
as of may   the company continues to believe it is more likely than not that there will not be an employee portion of contingent consideration payment due in november and  accordingly  there is no liability recorded at that date or any adjustment recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients which may not include knowledge of all significant events  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances could materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense and any such adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial result 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
stock based compensation under our performance incentive plan  officers  employees  and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock  stock units  options to purchase common stock or other stock or stock based awards 
under our espp  eligible officers and employees may purchase our common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan 
the company estimates a value for employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
additional variables to be considered are the expected term  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate over the expected term of our employee stock options 
in addition  because stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures must be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense recorded may differ materially from the amount recorded in the current period 
the company uses its historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option award to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the impact of expected dividends per share for fiscal is also incorporated in determining the estimated value per share of employee stock option grants 
such dividends are subject to quarterly board of director approval 
the company s historical expected life of stock option grants is years for non officers and years for officers 
the company uses its historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option award to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its common stock 
the company reviews the underlying assumptions related to stock based compensation at least annually 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

revenue direct cost of services gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses employee portion of contingent consideration adjustment contingent consideration adjustment amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense income from operations interest income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income we also assess the results of our operations using ebitda as well as adjusted ebitda  which is ebitda plus stock based compensation expense and contingent consideration adjustments adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda by revenue 
these measures assist management in assessing our core operating performance 
the following table presents ebitda and adjusted ebitda results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and includes a reconciliation of such measures to net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for the years ended may  may  may  amounts in thousands net income adjustments amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense interest income provision for income taxes ebitda stock based compensation expense contingent consideration adjustment adjusted ebitda revenue adjusted ebitda margin the financial measures and key performance indicators we use to assess our financial and operating performance above are not defined by  or calculated in accordance with  gaap 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that i excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures 
we believe that ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin provide useful information to our investors because they are financial measures used by management to assess the core performance of the company 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or construed as substitutes for net income or other cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  net income  earnings per share  cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in conformity with gaap 

table of contents further  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have the following limitations although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  equity based compensation is an element of our long term incentive compensation program  although we exclude it as an expense from adjusted ebitda when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon our results  as rounded and presented herein 
revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  we deliver our services to clients in a similar fashion across the globe  however in fiscal  revenue increased in north america but declined in europe and asia pacific as compared to fiscal in light of continuing global economic uncertainty  we believe that our global clients and prospects are initiating operation and improvement projects cautiously  resulting in reduced levels of consulting spending  particularly in certain european markets 
the number of hours worked in fiscal decreased from the prior year and average bill rates decreased by compared to the prior year 
the number of consultants on assignment at the end of fiscal was  compared to the  consultants engaged at the end of fiscal the average number of consultants assigned was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal 
we operated offices at may  and offices at may  as we consolidated certain offices in contiguous areas 
our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
as such  there can be no assurance as to future demand levels for the services that we provide or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends 
revenue for the company s major geographies across the globe consisted of the following dollars in thousands revenue for the year ended of total may  may  change may  may  north america europe asia pacific total our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates in effect during each quarter 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non united states based operations  our revenue can be impacted 
using the comparable fiscal conversion rates  international revenues would have been higher than reported under gaap by million for the year ended may  direct cost of services 
direct cost of services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  direct cost of services decreased primarily because of a decrease in hours worked compared to the prior year  in addition  the average pay rate per hour to our consultants was down compared to the prior year 
the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
the decrease in the direct cost of services percentage resulted primarily from improvement in the bill rate to pay rate relationship and a decrease in zero margin client reimbursements 
our target direct cost of services percentage is for all of our offices 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a 
s  g a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  however  s  g a increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  management and administrative head count was at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal s  g a decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily because of a reduction in management compensation and related business expenses much of which is attributable to foreign currency exchange fluctuations in our international operations  stock based compensation expenses and lower occupancy costs for certain of the company s leased office facilities 
sequential operations 
on a sequential quarter basis  fiscal fourth quarter revenues increased to million from million  hours improved and bill rates increased 
the improvement in hours is partially attributable to the lack of significant holidays in the united states in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter  which included the christmas and new year s holidays 
the direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue direct cost of services percentage decreased from in the third quarter to 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the absence of paid holidays in the united states during the fourth quarter and the declining impact of payroll taxes as the calendar year progresses 
s  g a expenses increased  from the quarter ended february  to the quarter ended may   primarily as a result of increased marketing spend and severance expenses in certain european offices offset by reduced payroll related benefit costs 
the leverage of s  g a expenses was relatively flat at in the third quarter of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal a downturn or softening in global economic conditions and the impact of the summer holiday period could put resulting pressure on revenue in the first quarter of fiscal  and may limit our ability to leverage direct cost of services and s  g a expenses 
employee portion of contingent consideration adjustment and contingent consideration adjustment 
at the conclusion of the second annual evaluation period for earn out qualification as of november   the company determined that it was more likely than not that the sitrick brincko group would not exceed the target average ebitda of million necessary for an earn out payment in november and reduced the fair value of the estimated liability from million to zero  representing a non cash favorable adjustment as reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  million net of tax  including the employee portion adjustment discussed below 
as of may   the company has not altered its conclusion after updating its probability weighted assessment of various projected ebitda scenarios for the remaining two quarters in the earn out period 
in addition  in fiscal  the company also reversed its previously recorded estimate of  for the employee portion of contingent consideration after determining that it is more likely than not that the earn out contingent consideration will not be paid 
as of may   the company continues to believe it is more likely than not that no contingent consideration will be payable 
in the event that the contingent consideration is not paid at the conclusion of the earn out period  mr 
brincko will be entitled to receive a cash payment of  subject to his employment in good standing with the company as defined 
as a result of the company s determination that it is more likely than not that the contingent consideration will not be earned  this amount is recognized as a component of s  g a over the remaining service period from the time it was estimated that no contingent consideration will be due 
the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration payable  including the employee portion  requires very subjective assumptions to be made of various potential operating result scenarios  significant increases in the future estimated ebitda could result in an increase in the estimated fair value of the sitrick brincko group contingent consideration and therefore materially affect the company s future financial results and financial condition 
amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is the result of the completion of amortization on certain identifiable intangible assets 
based upon identified intangible assets recorded at may   the company anticipates amortization expense related to identified intangible assets to approximate million during the fiscal year ending may  depreciation expense decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  depreciation decreased as a number of assets were fully depreciated during fiscal and fiscal and the company has slowed the amount invested in property and equipment since fiscal as compared to previous fiscal years 
interest income 
interest income declined to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of lower interest rates available for the company s investments as compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  lower available cash balances available for investment 
the company has invested available cash in certificates of deposit  money market investments and commercial paper that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company had million of investments in commercial paper and certificates of deposit with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 

table of contents income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million effective rate of for the year ended may  to million effective rate of for the year ended may  while the provision decreased because of lower pretax income  the effective tax rate increased as a consequence of the mix of international results 
in addition  the provision for taxes in each of fiscal and fiscal resulted from taxes on income from operations in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  a lower benefit for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the united states statutory rates  and no benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance on operating loss carryforwards had previously been established 
the effective tax rate in both fiscal years disproportionally magnifies the effect of the components of the tax rate that differ from the standard federal rate  including non deductible permanent differences and incentive stock options isos 
based upon current economic circumstances  management will continue to monitor the need to record additional valuation allowances in the future  primarily related to certain foreign jurisdictions 
realization of the foreign deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the tax provision 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will remain constant in the future because of the lower benefit from the united states statutory rate for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions  the limitation on the benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance for operating loss carryforwards has previously been established  and the unpredictability of timing and the amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises 
the company cannot recognize a tax benefit for certain iso grants unless and until the holder exercises his or her option and then sells the shares within a certain period of time 
in addition  the company can only recognize a potential tax benefit for employees acquisition and subsequent sale of shares purchased through the espp if the sale occurs within a certain defined period 
as a result  the company s provision for income taxes is likely to fluctuate from these factors for the foreseeable future 
further  those tax benefits associated with iso grants fully vested at the date of adoption of the current accounting rules governing stock awards will be recognized as additions to paid in capital when and if those options are exercised and not as a reduction to the company s tax provision 
the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the proportion of expense related to non qualified stock option grants for which the company may recognize a tax benefit in the same quarter as the related compensation expense in most instances is significant as compared to expense related to isos including espps 
however  the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted 
the company predominantly grants nonqualified stock options to employees in the united states 
the company has maintained a position of being indefinitely reinvested in its foreign subsidiaries earnings by not expecting to remit foreign earnings in the foreseeable future 
being indefinitely reinvested does not require a deferred tax liability to be recognized on the foreign earnings 
management s indefinite reinvestment position is supported by rgp us has generated more than enough cash to fund operations and expansion  including acquisitions 
rgp uses its excess cash to  at its discretion  return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and stock repurchases 
rgp us has no debt or any other current or known obligations that require cash to be remitted from foreign subsidiaries 
management s growth objectives include allowing cash to accumulate in rgp s profitable foreign subsidiaries with the expectation of finding strategic expansion plans to further penetrate rgp s most successful locations 
the consequences of distributing foreign earnings have historically been deemed to be tax inefficient for rgp or not materially beneficial 
management determined during the fiscal year ended may  that it was a prudent time to make an exception to the indefinite reinvestment position and approved the payment of a one time dividend from rgp japan of million and rgp hong kong of million 
the one time exception is based upon opportunistic timing for a dividend distribution because of the favorable exchange rates between the us and japan for a tax beneficial result from both rgp japan and rgp hong kong 
after the one time dividend  management s intent and ability for indefinite reinvestment will continue for all entities  including rgp japan and rgp hong kong

revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  we deliver our services to clients in a similar fashion across the globe and in fiscal  revenue increased in all geographies over the fiscal amount

amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is the result of the completion of amortization on certain identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation expense decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  depreciation decreased as a number of assets were fully depreciated during fiscal and and the company has slowed the amount invested in property and equipment in fiscal and as compared to previous fiscal years 
interest income 
interest income declined to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of lower interest rates available for the company s investments as compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  lower available cash balances for investment

the provision for income taxes increased from million effective rate of for the year ended may  to million effective rate of for the year ended may  while the provision increased because of the increased pretax income  the effective tax rate decreased as a result of an improved mix of international results  along with the realization of certain non recurring credits 
the company also recorded tax charges of  and million for the years ended may  and may   respectively  to establish valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
realization of those tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable income 
in addition  the provision for taxes in fiscal and fiscal results from taxes on income from operations in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  a lower benefit for losses in certain foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the united states statutory rates  and no benefit for losses in jurisdictions in which a valuation allowance on operating loss carryforwards had previously been established 
the effective tax rate in both fiscal years disproportionally magnifies the effect of the components of the tax rate that differ from the standard federal rate  including non deductible permanent differences and isos 
the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the proportion of expense related to non qualified stock option grants for which the company may recognize a tax benefit in the same quarter as the related compensation expense in most instances is significant as compared to expense related to isos including espps 
however  the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted

see note contingent consideration to the consolidated financial statements 
net income per common share calculations for each of the quarters were based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding for each period  and the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year net income per common share amount 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in part i item a 
risk factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  historically  to a lesser extent  stock option exercises 
we have generated positive cash flows annually from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may  our ability to continue to increase positive cash flow from operations in the future will be  at least in part  dependent on improvement in global economic conditions 
at may   the company had operating leases  primarily for office premises  and purchase obligations  primarily for property and equipment  expiring at various dates 
at may   the company had no capital leases 
the following table summarizes our future minimum rental commitments under operating leases and our other known contractual obligations as of may  payments due by period contractual total fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter obligations amounts in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose the interest rate applicable to advances 
the interest rate options are bank of america s prime rate and a london inter bank offered rate libor plus 
interest  if any  is payable monthly 
the credit agreement expires november  as of may   the company had approximately million available under the terms of the credit agreement as bank of america has issued approximately million of outstanding letters of credit in favor of third parties related to operating leases 
as of may   the company was in compliance with all covenants included in the credit agreement 
operating activities provided million in cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted from net income of million and net favorable non cash reconciling adjustments of million principally depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense 
other balance sheet account changes between the two periods  including working capital balances  were negligible 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted from net income of million  net unfavorable non cash reconciling adjustments of million principally depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and contingent consideration and related deferred tax impact and by net negative balance sheet account changes  including working capital accounts  of million 
operating cash flows between the two years are relatively similar as  absent the impact of the adjustments to contingent consideration and related deferred taxes in fiscal  net income between the two years is virtually the same million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
the adjustment to contingent consideration in fiscal was the result of the company s determination that it was more likely than not that no contingent consideration will be payable in november related to the acquisition of sitrick brincko group based on projected earn out scenarios 
stock based compensation expense does not reflect an actual cash outflow from the company but is an estimate of the fair value of the services provided by employees and directors in exchange for stock option grants and purchase of stock through the company s espp and was relatively the same between fiscal and fiscal in addition  non cash amortization fell in fiscal as certain assets were fully amortized in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash received from the redemption of short term investments primarily commercial paper  net of cash used to purchase short term investments  resulted in a use of cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company spent approximately  more on property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended may   compared to million for the year ended may  the company received approximately million in fiscal from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of shares via the company s espp compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
however  the company used less cash in fiscal million to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock as compared to million to purchase million shares of common stock in fiscal payments for the company s dividend program increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the company s increase in fiscal of its quarterly dividend from to per common share 

table of contents the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at may  we anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making strategic acquisitions 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business or to pay dividends on our capital stock  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  market position and competitiveness 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  however  assuming a constant balance available for investment  a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income but would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non united states based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period 
approximately of our fiscal year end balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were denominated in united states dollars 
the remaining amount of approximately was comprised primarily of cash balances translated from euros  canadian dollars  japanese yen or hong kong dollars 
the difference resulting from the translation each period of assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations is recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
although we intend to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we do not currently use financial hedging techniques to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  and we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
