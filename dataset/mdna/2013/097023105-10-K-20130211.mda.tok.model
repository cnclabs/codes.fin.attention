table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expense years ended december  commercial airplanes defense  space security other total our research and development expense decreased by million and million in and these decreases were primarily due to lower spending at bca on the and programs 
the most significant items included in unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  share based plans deferred compensation pension postretirement eliminations and other total share based plans expense decreased by million in primarily due to the expiration of the sharevalue trust at june  deferred compensation expense increased by million in and decreased by million in the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions 
eliminations and other unallocated items expense increased by million in and decreased by million in the fluctuations in and were due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items 
the expense includes a million benefit related to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation and the expense includes a million charitable contribution 
unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
the unallocated expense in includes million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations 
see the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in note to our consolidated financial statements 
earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and other unallocated items and eliminations

our effective income tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was higher than prior years  primarily due to tax benefits of million and million recorded in and as a result of federal income tax audit settlements 
federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to the absence of research and development tax credits also contributed to the higher tax rate in our effective tax rate was lower than  primarily due to an income tax charge of million recorded during the first quarter of as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of the research and development credit expired on december  on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of that retroactively renews the research and development credit for and extends the credit through december  as tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted  the r d credit of approximately million will be reflected as a discrete item in our income tax rate for the first quarter of for additional discussion related to income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements

the increase in contractual backlog during was due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries  partially reduced by cancellations of commercial airplane orders and changes in projected revenue escalation 
the increase in contractual backlog during was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes 
unobligated backlog includes us and us government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
the increase in unobligated backlog during is due to increases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to f orders and the contract award for the space launch system program received in the decrease in unobligated backlog during is due to decreases at bds of  million compared with primarily due to funding of existing multi year contracts and termination for convenience by the us army of the brigade combat team modernization bctm program  partially offset by the us air force usaf contract for the kc a tanker and the missile defense agency development and sustainment contract 
additional considerations kc a tanker in  we were awarded a contract from the usaf to design  develop  manufacture and deliver next generation aerial refueling tankers 
the kc a tanker will be a derivative of our commercial aircraft 
this contract is a fixed price incentive firm contract valued at billion and involves highly complex designs 
changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge 
this contract contains production options 
if all options under the contract are exercised  we expect to deliver aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately billion 
for segment reporting purposes  backlog  revenues and costs are recorded in the commercial airplanes and bma segments 
collective bargaining agreement our collective bargaining agreement with the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace speea  which covers  employees  expired in october  speea represented employees continue to work under the terms of that contract

table of contents segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment global economic growth and global trade  which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth  remained weak in despite this  passenger traffic grew by approximately in and and is forecast to continue at or near the long term trend of in there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models  with airlines operating in emerging economies and low cost carriers leading growth 
estimates indicate a modest decline in air cargo traffic in with continued softness in the relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions  and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business 
airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity 
airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances  partnerships  new marketing initiatives  and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues 
airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high fuel price environment 
net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total billion in and the forecast shows some improvement in these profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry  and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty 
the long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization  and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger and cargo traffic  based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes  credit market shocks  terrorism  natural disasters  conflicts  and increased global environmental regulations 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has enabled low cost airlines to continue gaining market share 
these airlines have increased the pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately of commercial airplanes contractual backlog  in dollar terms  is with us airlines  including cargo carriers 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
with government support  airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china and japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above seats 
many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support  including launch aid  which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible 
this market environment 
table of contents has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors  and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
changes in value of the us dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits 
competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker us dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
if the us dollar strengthens  competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development  gain market share through pricing and or improve earnings 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively

revenues for increased by  million or compared with due to higher new airplane deliveries  including the impact of entry into service of the and freighter  favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues 
the increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares 

table of contents commercial airplanes deliveries as of december were as follows total cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries includes intercompany deliveries of nine aircraft in  seven in and five in includes three aircraft accounted for as revenues by bca and as operating leases in consolidation 
earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased by  million compared with this was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries  which drove an increase in earnings of  million  and lower research and development expense of million primarily due to lower spending on the and programs 
these increases were partially offset by lower earnings of million driven by higher fleet support costs  increased operating costs associated with business growth  other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services 
the decrease in operating margins from in to in was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the and deliveries 
earnings from operations for increased by million compared with this increase reflects earnings of million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries  million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and million of lower research and development expense  partially offset by increases of million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth 
backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform 
backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain  such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors  shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements 
all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain 
firm orders exclude options 
a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
however  once orders are included in firm backlog  orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled  although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers 
the increase in contractual backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries  partially reduced by cancellations of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation 
the decrease in unobligated backlog in was due to incremental funding of the existing multi year contract for commercial airplanes share of the usaf contract for the kc a tanker 
the increase in contractual backlog during was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation  partially reduced by cancellations of orders 
the increase in unobligated backlog in represents commercial airplanes share of the usaf contract for the kc a tanker 

table of contents accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates  all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
program program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders the initial accounting quantity for the program was established in the third quarter of program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes 
as planned  production increased from to airplanes per month during we continue to expect to increase production from to airplanes per month beginning in and a further increase to airplanes per month beginning in the majority of the orders during related to the max  the new engine variant of the the accounting quantity for the program includes ng and max units 
first delivery of the max is expected in program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units in  reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts 
we continue to incorporate changes identified during flight testing into previously completed airplanes 
first delivery of the intercontinental occurred in february the production rate increased from to airplanes per month in may ongoing weakness in the air cargo market and lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated in we have a number of unsold freighter and intercontinental production positions beyond if we are unable to obtain orders for multiple freighter aircraft in consistent with our near term production plans  we may be required to take actions including 
table of contents reducing the number of airplanes produced and or building airplanes for which we have not received firm orders 
we also remain focused on reducing out of sequence work  improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost reduction efforts 
if market and production risks cannot be mitigated  the program could face an additional reach forward loss that may be material 
program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts 
as we reconfigure the assembly line to include the usaf kc a tanker  we plan to decrease our production rate from to airplanes per month in late we then expect to increase the rate to per month in and back to per month in program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes 
as previously announced  we plan to increase our production rate from per month to per month in program we delivered aircraft in bringing cumulative deliveries to we continued to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing into already completed aircraft 
beginning in june  airplanes coming out of final assembly have not required change incorporation at our everett modification center 
during the second quarter of we achieved a production rate of per month in final assembly and in the fourth quarter of  we achieved a program production rate of airplanes per month in final assembly 
we also activated the temporary surge line in everett in the third quarter 
we remain focused on achieving further planned increases in production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements 
we also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly  including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain  completion and integration of traveled work  as well as introduction of the derivative into the manufacturing process 
we continue to expect to increase the production rate of aircraft to per month in final assembly by the end of with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system  coordinating rate increases with suppliers and increasing production rates in both everett and north charleston final assembly 
we continue to expect first delivery of the to occur in early in addition  we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes  including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions 
during  we concluded that the first three flight test aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft 
as a result  costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense 
during the fourth quarter of we finalized an order for one of the three remaining flight test aircraft 
we continue to believe that the other two flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at december  if we determine that either of the remaining aircraft cannot be sold  we may incur additional charges 
the accounting quantity of  units remains unchanged and represents approximately years of production at planned production rates 
the cumulative impacts of production challenges  change incorporation  schedule delays from prior periods and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability 
if risks related to this program  including risks associated with change incorporation  planned production rate increases  or introducing the derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated  the program could face additional customer claims and or supplier assertions  as well as further pressures on program profitability and or a reach forward loss 
we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks 
a battery related failure occurred on a aircraft on january  on january  a second aircraft had a battery incident 
on january   the federal aviation administration issued an 
table of contents airworthiness directive to address potential battery risk on the and required us aircraft operators to suspend operations of all aircraft 
international government regulators also issued directives to the same effect 
we are working with the government regulators and aircraft operators to investigate both incidents 
while production continues on the  we have suspended deliveries until appropriate clearance is granted by the regulatory agencies 
we are unable to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss at this time because such estimates are dependent on the ultimate finding as to cause and the timing and conditions surrounding a resolution and return to flight 
any such resolution could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services  information services and systems and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs

our research and development expense decreased by million and million in and these decreases were primarily due to lower spending on the and programs 
additional considerations the development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex  involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners 
meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards  as well as those of customers and regulators  can be costly and technologically challenging 
in addition  the introduction of new aircraft derivatives  such as the and max  involves increased risks associated with meeting development  production and certification schedules 
as a result  our ability to deliver aircraft on time  satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain  as applicable  program profitability is subject to significant risks 
factors that could result in lower margins or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach forward losses include the following changes to the program accounting quantity  customer and model mix  production costs and rates  changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts  performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft  capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity  learning curve  additional change incorporation  anticipated cost reductions  flight test and certification schedules  costs  schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims  supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations 
while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  order cancellations or other financially significant exposure 

table of contents defense  space security business environment and trends us defense environment overview in august  the budget control act reduced the united states department of defense us dod top line budget by approximately billion through in addition  us government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions  generally referred to as sequestration 
sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately billion from the defense top line budget through the office of management and budget omb has estimated that sequestration would reduce non exempt defense discretionary accounts during us government fiscal year by approximately excluding military personnel accounts 
the omb has further stated that the budget for overseas contingency operations and any unobligated balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program  project and activity level 
the us dod has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain  as yet undetermined  procurement programs  and other us government customers  such as nasa and various intelligence agencies  may be required to take comparable actions 
any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and or cash flows 
with the aforementioned fiscal challenges as a backdrop  the us dod announced a significant revision to the defense strategy in january this new strategy prioritized the asia pacific and middle east regions  reduced the number of ground forces  maintained nuclear deterrence and reduced cold war assets 
additionally  it emphasized the increasing importance of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr  cyber security  space  special operations  and unmanned systems in implementing the nation security posture 
we anticipated this shift in us dod priorities and aligned our strategy accordingly 
as such  we have been developing organic and inorganic capabilities to better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets  including the acquisition over the last five years of targeted capabilities with expertise in these priority markets 
international environment overview the international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories 
western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets 
in europe  the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term 
the strongest opportunities for bds growth in will be the middle east and asia pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies  coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats  will result in procurement of defense and security systems 

table of contents bds realignment effective january   and  certain programs were realigned among bds segments 
business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues bds revenues increased by million in compared with  due to higher revenues of  million in the bma segment and million in the gs s segment  partially offset by lower revenues of  million in the n ss segment

table of contents backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
bds total backlog increased by in  from  million to  million  primarily due to f and c orders and the contract award for the space launch system program received in for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our bds business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases  the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees  lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost  schedule or technical performance issues arise 
examples of these programs include ground based midcourse defense gmd  proprietary and space launch systems programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise during development  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues

boeing capital business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among certain us commercial airline customers 
bcc s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types most notably out of production boeing aircraft such as aircraft 
bcc provided customer financing of million and million during and while we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in  we expect financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service

table of contents bankruptcies in  american airlines  inc american airlines filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
american airlines retains certain rights by operating under chapter bankruptcy protection  including the right to reject executory contracts  such as aircraft leases 
american airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft 
at december   american airlines accounted for million of our customer financing portfolio  of which million represents collateral for million of non recourse debt 
we believe that our customer financing receivables from american airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy 
we continue to monitor the american airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business

throughout and at december   we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
currently  we have 
table of contents billion of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements 
we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs 
financing commitments totaled billion and billion as of december  and we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers 
historically  we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required 
in the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities  our commercial aircraft financing commitments  unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies  or other business requirements  we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt 
we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short term and long term commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
however  there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  under our commercial paper program  in the debt markets or our credit facilities 
at december  and  our pension plans were billion and billion underfunded as measured under gaap 
on an erisa basis our plans are more than funded at december  with minimal required contributions in we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately billion in we may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities 
the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the credit agreements  and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital as defined 
when considering debt covenants  we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   and the estimated timing thereof 
dollars in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt including current portion interest on debt pension and other postretirement cash requirements capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position total contractual obligations includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at december  variable rate debt was less than of our total debt at december  
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements  pursuant to erisa regulations  although we may make additional discretionary contributions 
estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for inventory procurement  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
income tax obligations as of december   our net liability for income taxes payable  including uncertain tax positions  was million 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions 
our income tax matters are excluded from the table above

critical accounting policies contract accounting we use contract accounting to determine revenue  cost of sales  and profit for almost all of our bds business 
contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 

table of contents due to the size  duration and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustments to the contract s inception to date revenues  cost of sales and profit  in the period in which such changes are made 
changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach forward loss or an adjustment to a reach forward loss  which would be recorded immediately in earnings 
for the years ending december   and cumulative catch up adjustments  including reach forward losses  across all bds contracts increased operating earnings by million  million and million  respectively 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
in addition  a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach forward loss position 
changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured part costs  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling and other non recurring costs  and warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 

table of contents to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non recurring costs  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of had been estimated to be lower by  it would have increased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
if the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of excluding the and programs which have gross margins that are breakeven or near breakeven at december  had been estimated to be higher by  it would have decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
if we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the and programs  or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing  cost or other assumptions related to these programs  we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results 
aircraft valuation allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings  collateral values and default rates 
if each customer s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were higher or lower at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased  the allowance would have increased or decreased by million 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for re lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 

table of contents had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  residual values equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december   and a future cumulative pre tax earnings reduction of approximately million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which approximately million would be recognized in our investment in sales type finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income 
declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   we estimate that we would have reduced pre tax income by million for the year ended december  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
april is our annual testing date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
we completed our assessment of goodwill as of april  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value 
changes in our forecasts  or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
as of december  and  we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible assets by less than million 

table of contents postretirement plans the majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans 
all nonunion and some union employees hired after december  are not covered by defined benefit plans 
we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements are based upon several assumptions  including the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense  projected benefit obligations and shareholders equity 
the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate as of december  dollars in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans projected benefit obligation net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
a decrease or increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million 
we expect net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately million and the portion recognized in earnings for to increase by approximately million primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from at december  to at december  and amortization of actuarial losses 
the assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year s expense  recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
the following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change as of december  dollars in millions change in medical trend rate increase bps change in medical trend rate decrease bps other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes 
as of december   the impact over the next months of a basis point rise in interest rates to our 
table of contents pre tax earnings would not be significant 
the investors in our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
