item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest producer of biodiesel in the united states 
we have been a leader in the biodiesel industry since we have transitioned from being primarily an operator of a third party owned network of facilities to now owning seven operating biodiesel production facilities with aggregate nameplate production capacity of million gallons per year  or mmgy 
we produce biodiesel primarily from lower cost feedstocks  such as inedible corn oil  used cooking oil and inedible animal fat 
a small portion of our biodiesel is produced using higher cost virgin vegetable oils  such as soybean oil 
we own biodiesel production facilities with nameplate capacities consisting of a mmgy facility in ralston  iowa  a mmgy facility near houston  texas  or the houston facility  a mmgy facility in danville  illinois  a mmgy facility in newton  iowa and a mmgy biodiesel production facility in albert lea  minnesota 
in january  we exercised our option to purchase a mmgy facility in seneca  illinois that we previously operated under a lease 
in october  we completed our acquisition of north texas bio energy  llc  or ntbe  a mmgy facility in new boston  texas  which was idled at the time we purchased it and remains idled pending completion of certain upgrades expected to be completed in second quarter in november  we completed our acquisition of bulldog biodiesel  llc  or bulldog  a mmgy facility near atlanta  georgia  that was idled at the time we purchased it and will remain so until certain repairs or upgrades are made 
see note acquisitions and equity transactions in our consolidated financial statements for description of these transactions 
during  we sold million gallons  including million gallons we purchased from third parties and resold 
during  we sold million gallons of biodiesel  including million gallons we purchased from third parties and resold and including six million gallons we manufactured for others 
beginning in the second half of  we and the biodiesel industry began to benefit from the implementation of the renewable fuel standard  or rfs  which became effective july  and requires obligated parties  including petroleum refiners and petroleum importers in the contiguous states and hawaii that have annual renewable fuel volume obligations  to use specified amounts of biomass based diesel  which 
table of contents includes biodiesel  as discussed further below 
in addition  the per gallon federal blenders tax credit  which had expired as of december   was reinstated in december retroactively for all of and prospectively for as a result of these regulatory changes  as well as improving general economic conditions and relatively high petroleum prices  the price of and demand for biodiesel increased significantly compared to the years prior to during  prior to the effectiveness of rfs and the reinstatement of the blenders tax credit  our average price for b was per gallon 
during  our average price per gallon of b was  or higher than the average price in  and we sold million gallons of biodiesel  compared to million gallons sold in all of during  our average price per gallons of b was  or higher than the average price in and lower than the average price in in  we sold million gallons of biodiesel  an increase of and over and gallons sold  respectively 
we own three partially completed biodiesel production facilities 
in  we began construction of two mmgy nameplate production capacity facilities  one near new orleans  louisiana and the other in emporia  kansas 
in february  we halted construction of these facilities as a result of conditions in the biodiesel industry and our inability to obtain financing necessary to complete construction of the facilities 
construction of the new orleans facility is approximately complete and construction of the emporia facility is approximately complete 
further  during the third quarter of  we acquired a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production capacity facility in clovis  new mexico which is approximately complete 
currently  the clovis facility is being operated as a terminal to fulfill biodiesel contracts for customers in the southwest 
we expect that the aggregate cost to complete construction and commence operations of these three facilities is in the range of approximately to million  excluding working capital 
in november  we acquired a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility near atlanta  georgia that was idled prior to our acquisition and will remain so until certain repairs or upgrades are made 
we plan to complete construction and upgrade of these facilities as financing becomes available  subject to market conditions 
on january   we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of shares of common stock in which we sold million shares at a price to the public of per share  which included million shares sold by selling shareholders 
the ipo raised proceeds to us of million after underwriting fees and offering costs 
in connection with the ipo  we executed a for reverse stock split of our common stock and our outstanding series a preferred stock was converted into shares of common stock and series b preferred stock 
we derive revenues from two reportable business segments biodiesel and services biodiesel segment our biodiesel segment  as reported herein  includes the operations of the following biodiesel production facilities a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in ralston  iowa  a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located near houston  texas  since its acquisition in june  a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in danville  illinois  since its acquisition in february  a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in newton  iowa  since its acquisition in march  a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in seneca  illinois  which began production in august  which we operated under a lease beginning in april and subsequently acquired in january  a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in albert lea  minnesota  since its acquisition in july  
table of contents a mmgy nameplate biodiesel production facility located in new boston  texas  since its acquisition in october that was idle prior to acquisition and remains idled pending completion of certain upgrades we expect to complete in second quarter  purchases and resale of biodiesel  renewable identification numbers  or rins  and raw material feedstocks acquired from third parties  our sales of biodiesel produced under toll manufacturing arrangements with third party facilities using our feedstocks  our production of biodiesel under toll manufacturing arrangements with third parties using their feedstocks at our facilities  and incentives received from federal and state programs for renewable fuels 
we derive a small portion of our revenues from the sale of glycerin  free fatty acids and other co products of the biodiesel production process 
in and  our revenues from the sale of co products were less than five percent of our total biodiesel segment revenues 
when we produce a gallon of biodiesel  we generate renewable identification numbers per gallon 
rins are used to track compliance with rfs using the epa moderated transaction system  or emts 
rfs allows us to attach between zero and rins to any gallon of biodiesel 
when we sell a gallon of biodiesel we generally attach rins 
as a result  a portion of our selling price for a gallon of biodiesel is generally attributable to rfs compliance 
rins may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel and once separated may be sold 
in addition  we may acquire rins from third parties and hold varying amounts of these rins for separate sales to obligated parties 
the value of these rins acquired from third parties is reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet and at the end of each accounting period  this rin inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and resulting adjustments are reflected in our cost of goods sold for the period 
services segment our services segment includes biodiesel facility management and operational services  whereby we provide day to day management and operational services to biodiesel production facilities as well as other clean tech companies  and construction management services  whereby we act as the construction management and general contractor for the construction of biodiesel production facilities 
historically  we provided facility operations management services to owners of biodiesel production facilities under management and operational services agreements  or mosas 
during  we ceased providing services to three of these facilities  acquired one and continued to provide limited services to the other facility 
the termination of our mosas has not had a significant impact on our financial statements 
during  we acquired the remaining facility to which we were providing limited services 
our services segment has been focused internally on managing and upgrading our facilities 
demand for our construction management and facility management and operational services depend on capital spending by potential customers and existing customers  which is directly affected by trends in the biodiesel industry 
we have not received any orders or provided services to outside parties for new facility construction services since we have  however  utilized our construction management expertise internally to upgrade three of our facilities during the last three years and we are currently in the process of a million upgrade to our albert lea facility 
we anticipate revenues derived from construction management services will be minimal in future periods 

table of contents factors influencing our results of operations the principal factors affecting our segments are the market prices for biodiesel and the feedstocks used to produce biodiesel  as well as governmental programs designed to create incentives for the production and use of biodiesel 
governmental programs favoring biodiesel production and use biodiesel has historically been more expensive than petroleum based diesel  excluding biodiesel incentives and credits 
the biodiesel industry s growth has largely been the result of federal and state programs that require or incentivize biodiesel  which allows biodiesel to compete with petroleum based diesel on price 
on july   rfs was implemented  stipulating volume requirements for the amount of biomass based diesel and other advanced biofuels that must be utilized in the united states each year 
under rfs  obligated parties  including petroleum refiners and fuel importers  must show compliance with these standards 
currently  biodiesel meets two categories of an obligated party s annual renewable fuel required volume obligation  or rvo biomass based diesel and undifferentiated advanced biofuel 
the rfs program requires the domestic use of one billion gallons of biodiesel in and billion gallons in as of this filing  the epa has not proposed or finalized the biomass based diesel requirement 
our sales volumes and revenues have benefited from our increased production capacity  as well as an increase in demand relating to the implementation of rfs rfs required the use of million gallons of biomass based diesel in according to emts data  approximately billion gallons of biomass based diesel were produced in  approximately of which was imported 
we believe more gallons were produced in than were required by rfs as a result of the fact that the blenders tax credit was set to expire on december  since obligated parties are allowed to satisfy up to of their rvo with rins  we believe many purchasers of biodiesel were taking advantage of the blenders tax credit while it was still available 
this overproduction had an impact on demand for biodiesel in the rfs requirement for biomass based diesel was one billion gallons 
the carry over could be used to satisfy up to million gallons of the one billion requirement 
according to emts data  approximately billion gallons of biomass based diesel was produced during  indicating that between the carry over and year production  there was sufficient biomass based diesel produced to satisfy the rvo of one billion gallons and create carryover towards the rvo 
the federal blenders tax credit provides a refundable tax credit per gallon of pure biodiesel  or b  to the first blender of biodiesel with petroleum based diesel fuel 
the blenders tax credit expired on december   was reinstated on december   retroactively for and prospectively for and expired again on december  on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which reinstated the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit for and retroactively reinstated the credit for the retroactive credit for is estimated to result in a net benefit to us of approximately million in the first half of the net benefit will increase our income before income taxes and equity investments by a similar amount 
we will recognize the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit related to eligible gallons during the first quarter of biodiesel and feedstock price fluctuations our operating results generally reflect the relationship between the price of biodiesel  including credits and incentives  like rins and the price of feedstocks used to produce biodiesel 
biodiesel is a low carbon  renewable alternative to petroleum based diesel fuel and is primarily sold to the end user after it has been blended with petroleum based diesel fuel 
biodiesel prices have historically been heavily influenced by petroleum based diesel fuel prices 
accordingly  biodiesel prices have generally been impacted by the same factors that affect petroleum prices  such as worldwide economic conditions  wars and other political events  opec production quotas  changes in refining capacity and natural disasters 

table of contents regulatory and legislative factors influence the price of biodiesel  in addition to petroleum prices 
biomass based diesel rin pricing  a value component that was introduced via rfs in july  has had a significant impact on our biodiesel pricing 
for example  the value of rins  as reported by oil price information service  or opis  has been significant to the price of biodiesel  contributing approximately  or  of the average b upper midwest spot price of a gallon of biodiesel as reported by the jacobsen in december and  or of the average b upper midwest spot price of a gallon of biodiesel as reported by the jacobsen in december in december  the value of rins  as reported by opis  contributed approximately  or  of the average b upper midwest spot price of a gallon of biodiesel as reported by the jacobsen 
during  the value of rins  as reported by opis  have contributed to the average b spot price of a gallon of biodiesel  as reported by the jacobsen  and range from a low of per gallon  or  in october to a high of  or  per gallon in january 
there was a sharp decline in rin prices during third quarter that carried through the end of the year 
during this period  rin pricing declined from per rin at june  to the low price of per rin in october  finishing the year at per rin on december   as reported by opis  which contributed to the decline in price of biodiesel during this decrease in the value of rins during resulted in a million write down to lower of cost or market on rin inventory acquired from third parties that occurred throughout the year 
see note other assets to our consolidated financial statements 
during  feedstock expense accounted for of our costs of goods sold  while methanol and chemical catalysts expense accounted for and of our costs of goods sold  respectively 
feedstocks for biodiesel production  such as inedible corn oil  used cooking oil  inedible animal fat and soybean oil are commodities and market prices for them will be affected by a wide range of factors unrelated to the price of biodiesel and petroleum based diesel fuels 
the following table outlines some of the factors influencing supply and price for each feedstock feedstock factors influencing supply and price inedible corn oil export demand implementation of inedible corn oil separation systems into existing and new ethanol facilities extraction system yield ethanol production demand for inedible corn oil from other markets used cooking oil export demand population number of restaurants in the vicinity of collection facilities and terminals which is dependent on population density eating habits  which can be impacted by the economy inedible animal fat export demand number of slaughter kills in the united states demand for inedible animal fat from other markets soybean oil export demand weather conditions soybean meal demand farmer planting decisions government policies and subsidies crop disease during and  and  respectively  of our feedstocks were comprised of inedible corn oil  used cooking oil and inedible animal fats with the remainder coming from refined vegetable oil 
we have increased the use of these feedstocks because they are lower cost than refined vegetable oils 

table of contents historically  most biodiesel in the united states has been made from soybean oil 
soybean oil prices have fluctuated greatly  but have generally remained at historically high levels since early due to higher overall commodity prices 
over the period january to december  soybean oil prices based on daily closing nearby futures prices on the cbot for crude soybean oil have ranged from per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in january to per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in march  assuming pounds of soybean oil yields one gallon of biodiesel 
the average closing price for soybean oil during was per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  compared to per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in over the period from january to december  the price of choice white grease  an inedible animal fat based on daily closing nearby futures prices for the jacobsen reported missouri river delivery of choice white grease  have ranged from per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in december to per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in june  assuming pounds of choice white grease yields one gallon of biodiesel 
the average closing price for choice white grease during was per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  or per pound  or per gallon of biodiesel  in the graph below illustrates the spread between the cost of producing one gallon of biodiesel made from soybean oil to the cost of producing one gallon of biodiesel made from a lower cost feedstock 
the results were derived using assumed conversion factors for the yield of each feedstock and subtracting the cost of producing one gallon of biodiesel made from each respective lower cost feedstock from the cost of producing one gallon of biodiesel made from soybean oil 
logo soybean oil crude prices are based on the monthly average of the daily closing sale price of the nearby soybean oil contract as reported by cbot based on pounds per gallons 
used cooking oil prices are based on the monthly average of the daily low sales price of missouri river yellow grease as reported by the jacobsen based on pounds per gallon 
inedible corn oil prices are reported as the monthly average of the daily distillers corn oil market values delivered to illinois as reported by the jacobsen based on pounds per gallon 
choice white grease prices are based on the monthly average of the daily low prices of missouri river choice white grease as reported by the jacobsen based on pounds per gallon 
our results of operations generally will benefit when the spread between biodiesel prices and feedstock prices widens and will be harmed when this spread narrows 
the following graph shows feedstock cost data of choice white grease and soybean oil on a per gallon basis compared to the sale price data for biodiesel  and the spread between the two  from december to december 
table of contents logo biodiesel prices are based on the monthly average of the midpoint of the high and low prices of b upper midwest as reported by the jacobsen 
soybean oil crude prices are based on the monthly average of the daily closing sale price of the nearby soybean oil contract as reported by cbot based on pounds per gallon 
choice white grease prices are based on the monthly average of the daily low price of missouri river choice white grease as reported by the jacobsen based on pounds per gallon 
spread between biodiesel price and choice white grease price 
spread between biodiesel price and soybean oil crude price 
the drought in the midwestern united states increased the cost of corn and soybeans and may increase the cost of biodiesel feedstocks in the future 
following the drought  there was a decrease in the price of animal fats  which may have been related to increases in slaughter rates  putting more supply on the market and decreased demand from the biodiesel industry 
if the increased slaughter rates or increased cost of corn and soybeans reduces future slaughter rates  the price of animal fats may rise as supply decreases in the future 
the impact of the drought on the prices of our feedstocks is uncertain  but the drought may increase the prices of some or all of our feedstocks as the market adjusts to higher commodity prices 
risk management the profitability of the biodiesel production business largely depends on the spread between prices for feedstocks and biodiesel  including rins  each of which is subject to fluctuations due to market factors 
adverse price movements for these commodities directly affect our operating results 
we attempt to protect operating margins by entering into risk management contracts that mitigate price volatility of our feedstocks  such as inedible corn oil  used cooking oil and inedible animal fat and energy prices 
we create offsetting positions by using a combination of forward fixed price physical purchases and sales contracts on feedstock and biodiesel  including risk management futures contracts  swaps and options primarily on heating oil and soybean oil  however  the extent to which we engage in risk management activities varies substantially from time to time  and from feedstock to feedstock  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in making risk management decisions  we utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information 

table of contents inedible corn oil  used cooking oil and inedible animal fat are the primary feedstocks we used to produce biodiesel in and we utilize several varieties of inedible animal fat  such as beef tallow and choice white grease derived from pork and poultry fat 
there is no established futures market for lower cost feedstocks 
the purchase prices for lower cost feedstocks are generally set on a negotiated flat price basis or spread to a prevailing market price reported by the usda price sheet or the jacobsen 
our limited efforts to risk manage against changing inedible corn oil  used cooking oil and inedible animal fat prices have involved entering into futures contracts  swaps or options on other commodity products  such as soybean oil or heating oil 
however  these products do not always experience the same price movements as lower cost feedstocks  making risk management for these feedstocks challenging 
we manage feedstock supply risks related to biodiesel production in a number of ways  including  where available  through long term supply contracts 
for example  most of the feedstock requirements for our ralston facility were supplied under a three year agreement with west central which expired on july  and was renewed october  the purchase price for soybean oil under these contracts may be indexed to prevailing chicago board of trade  or cbot  soybean oil market prices with a negotiated market basis 
we utilize futures contracts  swaps and options to risk manage  or lock in  the cost of portions of our future soybean oil requirements generally for varying periods up to one year 
our ability to mitigate our risk of falling biodiesel and rin prices is limited 
we have entered into forward contracts to supply biodiesel 
however  pricing under these forward sales contracts generally has been indexed to prevailing market prices  as fixed price contracts for long periods on acceptable terms have generally not been available 
there is no established market for biodiesel futures in the united states 
our efforts to hedge against falling biodiesel prices generally involve entering into futures contracts  swaps and options on other commodity products  such as diesel fuel and heating oil 
however  these products do not always experience the same price movements as biodiesel 
when we produce a gallon of biodiesel  we generate biomass based diesel rins per gallon 
we frequently acquire rins from third parties which we hold in inventory for resale 
there is no established futures market for rins  which severely limits the ability to risk manage the price of rins without the use of futures contracts  swaps and options 
we enter into forward contracts to sell rins and we use risk management position limits to monitor rins 
as a result of our strategy  we frequently have gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that are conversely offset by losses or gains on forward fixed price physical contracts on feedstocks and biodiesel or inventories 
gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognized each period in operating results while corresponding gains and losses on physical contracts are generally not recognized until quantities are delivered or title transfers 
our results of operations are impacted when there is a period mismatch of recognized gains or losses associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments used for risk management purposes at the end of the reporting period when the purchase or sale of feedstocks or biodiesel has not yet occurred and thus the offsetting gain or loss will be recognized in a later accounting period 
we incurred risk management losses of million from our derivative financial instrument trading activity for the year ended december   respectively  compared to risk management gains of million for the year ended december   respectively 
changes in the value of these futures or options instruments are recognized in current income or loss 
over the year  risk management losses have represented an expense of per gallon sold 
over the last three years  risk management losses have represented an expense of per gallon sold 
seasonality our operating results are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of biodiesel 
our sales tend to decrease during the winter season due to blending concentrations being reduced to compensate for performance during colder weather 
colder seasonal temperatures can cause the higher cloud point biodiesel we make from inedible animal fats to become cloudy and eventually gel at a higher temperature than petroleum based diesel or lower cloud point biodiesel made from soybean oil  canola oil or inedible corn oil 
such gelling can lead to plugged fuel filters and other fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers 
reduced 
table of contents demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel can result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel 
in addition  most of our production facilities are located in colder midwestern states and our costs of shipping increases as more biodiesel is transported to warmer climate states 
industry capacity and production our operating results are influenced by our industry s capacity and production  including in relation to rfs production requirements 
according to emts data  approximately billion gallons of biomass based diesel was produced in the united states in  primarily reflecting the recommencement of  or increase in  operations at underutilized facilities in response to rfs requirements 
such production was in excess of the million gallon rfs requirement for during  according to emts data  approximately billion gallons of biomass based diesel was produced  which also was above rfs required volumes of billion gallons of biomass based diesel for production in and in excess of rfs volume requirements put downward pressure on our margins for biodiesel  negatively affecting our profitability 
in addition  because the level of production in and exceeded the rfs biomass based diesel requirements  the demand for biodiesel in could be less than rfs required volumes of billion gallons of biomass based diesel 
as of this filing  the epa has not proposed or finalized the biomass based diesel requirement 
under rfs  obligated parties are entitled to satisfy up to of their annual requirement for with gallons used in  meaning that gallons could potentially be used to satisfy million gallons of the billion gallon requirement for components of revenues and expenses we derive revenues in our biodiesel segment from the following sources sales of biodiesel produced at our wholly owned facilities  including rins  transportation  storage and insurance costs to the extent paid for by our customers  fees from toll manufacturing arrangements at our facilities for third parties  revenues from our sale of biodiesel and rins produced by third parties through toll manufacturing arrangements with us  resale of finished biodiesel  rins acquired from third parties  and raw material feedstocks acquired from others  sales of glycerin  other co products of the biodiesel production process  and incentive payments from federal and state governments  including the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit  which we receive directly when we sell our biodiesel blended with petroleum based diesel  primarily as b  a less than one percent petroleum based diesel mix with biodiesel  rather than in pure form  or b  as well as  from the usda advanced biofuel program 
we derive revenues in our services segment from the following sources fees received from operations management services that we provide for biodiesel production facilities  typically based on production rates and profitability of the managed facility  and amounts received for services performed by us in our role as general contractor and construction manager for biodiesel production facilities 
cost of goods sold for our biodiesel segment includes with respect to our production facilities  expenses incurred for feedstocks  catalysts and other chemicals used in the production process  leases  utilities  depreciation  salaries and other indirect expenses related to the production process  and  when required by our customers  transportation  storage and insurance  
table of contents with respect to biodiesel acquired from third parties produced under toll manufacturing arrangements  expenses incurred for feedstocks  transportation  catalysts and other chemicals used in the production process and toll processing fees paid to the facility producing the biodiesel  with respect to finished goods and rins acquired from third parties  the purchase price of biodiesel and rins on the spot market or under contract  and related expenses for transportation  storage  insurance  labor and other indirect expenses  adjustments made to reflect the lower of cost or market values of our finished goods inventory  including rins acquired from third parties  and changes during the applicable accounting period in the market value of derivative and hedging instruments  such as exchange traded contracts  related to feedstocks and commodity fuel products 
cost of goods sold for our services segment includes with respect to our facility management and operations activities  primarily salary expenses for the services of management employees for each facility and others who provide procurement  marketing and various administrative functions  and with respect to our construction management services activities  primarily our payments to subcontractors constructing the production facility and providing the biodiesel processing equipment  and  to a much lesser extent  salaries and related expenses for our employees involved in the construction process 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of expenses generally involving corporate overhead functions and operations at our ames  iowa headquarters 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the series a preferred stock conversion feature  changes in fair value of interest rate swap  interest expense  interest income  the impairment of investments we made in biodiesel plants owned by third parties and the changes in valuation of the seneca holdco  llc liability associated with the put and call options on the equity interest in seneca landlord  llc  or landlord 
accounting for investments we use the equity method of accounting to account for the operating results of entities over which we have significant influence 
significant influence may be reflected by factors such as our ownership percentage  our significant operational influence due to our management of biodiesel operations at a third party owned facility and participation by one of our employees on the facility s board of directors 
prior to our acquisition of soymor on july   we accounted for our approximately ownership interest in soymor under the equity method due to our ownership interest  mosa and board seat 
in the past we used this method to account for our interests in other entities where we had a significant management role under a mosa and had board participation 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of soymor in july  therefore  beginning on the date of acquisition we are no longer accounting for our interest under the equity method  and the operations of soymor  like all of our other wholly owned subsidiaries are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
until it was consolidated on january   we used the equity method of accounting to account for the operating results of south bell  llc  or bell  llc  which owns our headquarters building 
we own of bell  llc and one of our employees is a member of bell  llc s board of managers 
under the equity method  we recognized our proportionate share of the net income loss of each entity in the line item income loss from equity investments 
see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the consolidation 
we use the cost method of accounting to account for our minority investment in three previously managed plants  east fork biodiesel  llc  or efb  western iowa energy  llc  or wie  since may   and western dubuque biodiesel  llc  or wdb  since august because we do not have the ability to influence the operating and financial decisions of efb  wie  or wdb  and do not maintain a position on the board of 
table of contents directors  the investment is accounted for using the cost method 
under the cost method  the initial investment is recorded at cost and assessed for impairment 
there was a million impairment recorded during  relating to the wind up and liquidation of efb  which fully impaired the remaining investment 
we have not recorded any impairment of our investments in wie or wdb 
for additional information with regard to prior accounting treatment for now acquired investments including blackhawk and cie  please see note acquisitions and equity transactions and note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended its guidance on accounting for variable interest entities  or vies 
as of january   we evaluated each investment and determined we do not hold a controlling interest in any of our investments in third party owned plants that would empower us to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance 
as a result  we are not the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vie s 
see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
on april   we determined that landlord was a vie and it was consolidated into our financial statements as we are the primary beneficiary 
see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the transaction 
we had a put call option with seneca holdco  llc  or seneca holdco  to purchase landlord and leased the plant during and for production of biodiesel  both of which represent a variable interest in landlord that was significant to the vie 
although we did not have an ownership interest in seneca holdco  it was determined that we were the primary beneficiary due to the related party nature of the entities involved  our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact landlord s economic performance and the design of landlord that ultimately gave us the majority of the benefit from the use of landlord s assets 
on january   we executed the call option and acquired the seneca facility 
for additional information about the acquisition please see note acquisitions and equity transactions to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  equities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from the following sources the sale of biodiesel  including rins  biodiesel co products and raw material feedstocks purchased by us or produced by us at owned manufacturing facilities  leased manufacturing facilities and manufacturing facilities with which we have tolling arrangements  resale of finished biodiesel  including rins and raw material feedstocks acquired from others  fees received under toll manufacturing agreements with third parties  fees received from federal and state incentive programs for renewable fuels  
table of contents fees from construction  operations and project management  and fees received for the marketing and sales of biodiesel produced by third parties 
biodiesel sales  including rins and raw material feedstock revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability can be reasonably assured 
we refer to agreements under which a biodiesel facility produces biodiesel for a third party using such third party s feedstock as tolling arrangements 
generally  the party producing the biodiesel receives a per gallon fee 
fees received under toll manufacturing agreements with third parties are generally established as an agreed upon amount per gallon of biodiesel produced 
the fees are recognized where there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability can be reasonably assured 
revenues associated with the governmental incentive programs are recognized when the amount to be received is determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and the sale of product giving rise to the incentive has been recognized 
our revenue from governmental incentive programs is comprised of amounts received from the usda advanced biofuel program  or the usda program  and the blender s tax credit 
for a discussion of the blender s tax credit  see the section entitled risk factors loss or reductions of tax incentives for biodiesel production or consumption would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating margins and factors influencing our results of operations governmental programs favoring biodiesel production and use 
in connection with the blender s tax credit  we file a claim with the internal revenue service  or irs  for a refund of excise taxes each week for gallons we have blended to b and sold during the prior week 
during  we have collected these claims in approximately days on average from the time we file and we currently have no filed claims older than one month 
other than routine audits of these claims  we have had no denials or challenges of our claims and no issues with collectability 
on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which reinstated a set of tax extender items including the reinstatement of the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit for and retroactively reinstated credit for the collection process relating to qualifying blenders credit tax credit will be slightly different than in previous years  where we will file a claim with the irs for a refund of excise taxes for fourth quarter activity and then file for the remaining refund related to the first three quarters of with the federal income tax return 
the retroactive credit for is estimated to result in a net benefit to us of approximately million in the first half of the net benefit will increase our income before income taxes and equity investments by a similar amount 
we will recognize the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit for the gallons we blended in during the first quarter of as the law was signed on january  in connection with the usda program  funds are allocated to the company based on our proportionate eligible biofuels production and available funds under the usda program 
due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be received  we do not record amounts until we have received notification from the usda or are in receipt of the funds 
historically  we have provided consulting and construction services under turnkey contracts 
these jobs require design and engineering effort for a specific customer purchasing a unique facility 
we record revenues on these fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
the total contract price includes the original contract plus any executed change orders only when the amounts have been received or awarded 
contract costs include all direct labor and benefits  materials unique to or installed in the project and subcontract costs 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
we routinely review estimates related to contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we would recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 

table of contents changes relating to executed change orders  job performance  construction efficiency  weather conditions and other factors affecting estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed to customers prior to providing related construction services 
fees for managing ongoing operations of third party plants  marketing biodiesel produced by third party plants and from other services are recognized as services are provided 
we also have performance based incentive agreements that are included as management service revenues 
these performance incentives are recognized as revenues when the amount to be received is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the past  we have acted as a sales agent for certain third parties under our mosas  thus we recognized revenues on a net basis in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
we included the fees earned under the mosas in revenue 
all of our third party mosas have expired or were terminated during impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles 
we review long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  or asc topic asset impairment charges are recorded for long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired and the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by management estimates using discounted cash flow calculations 
the estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what we would expect to recover from the future use of the asset 
significant assumptions used by management in the undiscounted cash flow analysis include the projected demand for biodiesel based on annual renewable fuel volume obligations under rfs  our capacity to meet that demand  the market price of biodiesel and the cost of feedstock used in the manufacturing process 
for facilities under construction  management s estimates also include the capital expenditures necessary to complete construction of the plant 
our facilities under construction are expected to have substantially similar operating capabilities and results as our current operating facilities 
such operating capabilities would include similar feedstock capabilities  similar access to low cost feedstocks  proximity to shipping from our vendors and to our customers  and our ability to transfer best practices among our various operating facilities to maximize production volumes and reduce operating costs 
we estimated the future cash flows from the facilities under construction utilizing the following significant assumptions costs to complete the remaining costs to complete the plant construction were developed by management  using historical and plant specific knowledge and external estimates 
management s estimate of costs included those required to finish the general structure of each facility  as well as furnish it with the appropriate equipment necessary to produce biodiesel 
there has not been an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group 
there can be no assurance actual costs to complete or upgrade these facilities will be consistent with these estimates 
gallons sold we estimated the aggregate gallons to be produced and sold based upon nameplate capacity of the plants under construction coupled with historical operating rates for our existing plants 
gross margin per gallon we have estimated rising sales prices and costs after this annual increase is a consequence of anticipated increased demand for biodiesel  market trends expected for the energy industry and normal inflationary pressures 
biodiesel sales prices were estimated using the expected prices for 
table of contents biodiesel  rins and co products 
when building the estimate for future prices  we weighed historical evidence  cbot and nymex future prices and industry forecasts 
to develop the estimated feedstock prices  we utilized soybean oil as a base coupled with a spread to soybean oil for all other feedstocks based on historical experience and expected future price changes 
plant operation costs we estimated plant operation costs to increase with production  until a steady cost level is reached once the plants are operating in a stabilized manner 
plant operating costs are estimated based upon costs at currently operating plants and take into account the size of the plants under construction and production volumes 
financing of facilities under construction in  we halted construction on our new orleans  louisiana  and emporia  kansas facilities as a result of conditions in the biodiesel industry and the credit markets 
we continue to pursue financing and intend to complete the facilities  when industry conditions improve and financing becomes available on terms satisfactory to us 
since construction halted at these facilities in  we have continued to monitor the construction sites and perform routine maintenance on the partially constructed assets 
we also have pursued programs under which we could obtain a government guarantee to enhance our ability to obtain financing for these facilities  but at this point have not been able to obtain any such guarantees 
we will continue to pursue such government programs in the future to the extent they arise 
if available  we would also consider using funds from operations to fund a portion of the construction at these facilities 
as currently configured  the assets can be completed as biodiesel production facilities  or with alternative or additional capabilities for the manufacture of specialty chemicals or other renewable products such as advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals 
some of the existing components could be transported for use at our other production facility locations  or they could be sold to third parties for various uses 
the emporia construction project benefits from a city incentive package that continues through july  in addition  from time to time we have had discussions with potential investors and commercial partners regarding these facilities 
we have also invested in third party engineering studies to revise and enhance construction completion plans on a more cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you if or when such facilities will be completed or any alternate transaction regarding such facilities that we may pursue will be consummated 
period of time used in recovery analysis to estimate the period of time utilized in the recovery analysis  we followed the guidance included in asc topic  which states in part that estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset asset group shall be made for the remaining useful life of the asset asset group to the entity 
for purposes of this subtopic  the primary asset is the principal long lived tangible asset being depreciated or intangible asset being amortized that is the most significant component asset from which the asset group derives its cash flow generating capacity 
we considered the plant assets and their operational functionality and determined that the inner equipment of the plants  eg tanks  separators  filters  heaters  etc  is the most significant component of the asset group 
we have determined that the useful life of this equipment has a range of years depending on its use  with the majority of the equipment having a year life 
therefore  we have selected a year period from the original date the assets are placed into service as the time period over which the cash flows would be projected 
our analysis determined that the undiscounted cash flows of each plant exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and therefore no charge for impairment was needed 
during  certain of our soybean oil supply agreements were cancelled 
the original agreements were recorded as intangible assets in the amount of million 
as a result of the cancellations  the full amount was charged off as an impairment during the year ended december  we also recorded an impairment on deferred financing cost related to gulf opportunity zone  or gozone  bonds available as part of congress tax incentive program to help the gulf coast recover from hurricane katrina 
we determined that it was not probable that the gozone bonds allocation would be extended past the december  deadline or that the bonds would be issued prior to the deadline  and accordingly  we returned our allocation prior to the deadline 
the amount of the impairment for the year ended december  was million 

table of contents total asset impairment charges of million were recorded for the year ended december  there were no asset impairment charges for the years ended december  or goodwill asset valuation 
while goodwill is not amortized  it is subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
as required by asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually on july or when we believe impairment indicators exist 
goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units 
the company s reporting units consist of its two operating segments  the biodiesel operating segment and services operating segments 
the analysis is based on a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value  determined utilizing a discounted cash flow  or dcf  methodology and consideration of a market approach 
additionally  we review the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or sustained unfavorable changes in market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill asset and result in an impairment charge 
we engaged an independent external valuation specialist to provide assistance in measuring the fair value of our biodiesel and services reporting units using an income approach 
the income approach uses a discounted cash flow  or dcf  analysis based on cash flow estimates prepared by us in addition to comparing other selected public guideline company information 
the selected dcf method is an invested capital method 
in performing the services reporting unit goodwill impairment analysis  cash flows generated from services provided to third parties and to the biodiesel segment were used to determine the reporting unit s fair value 
the annual impairment tests as of july  determined that the fair value at each of the reporting units exceeded its value by over margins 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded in  or there can be no assurances that future circumstances and or conditions will not change  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
such circumstances and or conditions could include  but are not limited to  further decline in the price of our common stock  deterioration in our financial condition or results of operations  and or adverse changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
management continues to monitor circumstances and conditions for events that could result in an impairment of our goodwill 
the company s declines in income before income taxes and loss from equity investments for the services reporting unit are primarily a result of construction revenues being derived from company owned facilities during this period and the termination of four third party mosas  which occurred in early income before income taxes and loss from equity investments  as it appears in the segment footnote disclosure  presents only the income from third parties after the elimination of intersegment revenues and associated costs 
two of these mosas ceased because the facilities to which services were being provided were acquired in a business combinations 
during the periods presented in the annual financial statements the amount of service revenues earned from third parties declined  but the amount of service revenues earned from the biodiesel segment increased 
after incorporating intersegment revenues  presented in the segment footnote  income before income taxes and loss from equity investments increased from to and again from to additionally  the operating results for the services segment were significantly impacted by the improvement in the biodiesel industry induced by the volume requirements set forth in rfs since services revenue from facility management and operations is principally earned on a per gallon basis  improvements in industry production volumes generally yield similar improvements in the services reporting unit operating income  cash flows and estimated fair value 
therefore  we do not believe the recent operational results of the services segment represent an indicator of impairment for the reporting unit 
income taxes 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
a valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be 
table of contents objectively verified 
due to the losses incurred prior to fiscal  we were in a cumulative loss position for the preceding three years which is considered significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome on a more likely than not standard through objectively verifiable data 
while our long term financial outlook remained positive  we concluded that our ability to rely on our long term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income was limited due to uncertainty created by the weight of the negative evidence 
as a result  we previously recorded a valuation allowance offsetting our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  due to the significant increase in profitability  we were able to utilize net operating loss carry forwards to significantly offset the taxable income  resulting in a significant reduction of the valuation allowances 
due to our positive earnings through fiscal  and the absence of any significant negative evidence to the contrary  we have concluded that we can rely on our positive long term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the reserve against the majority of our deferred tax assets was removed in fiscal  resulting in a credit to income of million  which is included in our net income tax benefit for the year 
we believe there is a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions we take on the various federal and state tax returns we file 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may not agree with our position on certain issues  we expect to establish and maintain tax reserves 
consolidations 
on april   we determined that landlord was a vie and consolidated it into our financial statements as we are the primary beneficiary asc topic 
we had a put call option with seneca holdco to purchase landlord and we leased the plant for production of biodiesel as of december   both of which represent a variable interest in landlord that are significant to the vie 
although we did not have an ownership interest in seneca holdco  we determined that we were the primary beneficiary because the equity owners are our stockholders  our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impacted landlord s economic performance  and  the design of the leasing arrangement that ultimately gave us the majority of the benefit from the use of landlord s assets 
we elected the fair value option available under asc topic on the million investment made by seneca holdco and the associated put and call options 
changes in the fair value after the date of the transaction were recorded in earnings 
those assets were owned by and those liabilities were obligations of landlord  which we consolidated as the primary beneficiary 
on january   the company acquired the seneca facility pursuant to the exercise of its option under the put call agreement 
see note acquisitions and equity transactions to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the acquisition 
during  we invested  through a wholly owned subsidiary  in bell  llc  a vie joint venture  whereby we own of the outstanding units 
commencing january   we have the right to execute a call option with the joint venture member  dayton park  llc  to purchase bell  llc  therefore  we determined we were the primary beneficiary of bell  llc and consolidated bell  llc into our financial statements in accordance with asc topic see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the consolidation 
derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
the financial accounting standards board issued asc topic  derivatives and hedging or asc asc established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and required that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we utilize futures contracts  swaps and options to hedge feedstock purchases and biodiesel sales contracts 
we have designated the derivatives as non hedge derivatives that are utilized to manage cash flow 
additionally  we have entered into an interest rate swap with the objective of managing risk caused by fluctuations in market interest rate risks associated with the reg danville loan 
unrealized gains and losses on the futures contracts  swaps and options are therefore recognized as a component of biodiesel cost of goods sold  and are reflected in current results of operations 
unrealized gains and losses on the interest rate swap are recorded in other income or expense  net 
valuation of preferred stock embedded derivatives 
in connection with our ipo on january   we gave effect to the one time conversion of series a preferred stock and certain common stock warrants into 
table of contents  shares of newly issued class a common stock and  shares of series b preferred stock with a  aggregate liquidation preference and cumulative dividends of per annum 
no shares of series a preferred stock remain outstanding after the ipo 
we determined that the conversion feature of series a preferred stock was an embedded derivative because the redemption feature allowed the holder to redeem series a preferred stock for cash at a price which could vary based on the fair market value of the series a preferred stock  which effectively provided the holders of the series a preferred stock with a mechanism to net settle the conversion option 
consequently  the embedded conversion option were bifurcated and accounted for separately because the economic characteristics of this conversion option were not considered to be clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the series a preferred stock  which was considered more akin to a debt instrument than equity 
upon issuance of series a preferred stock  we recorded a liability representing the estimated fair value of the right of holders of the series a preferred stock to receive the fair market value of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock on the redemption date 
this liability was adjusted each quarter based on changes in the estimated fair value of such right  and a corresponding income or expense was recorded in change in fair value of the preferred stock conversion feature embedded derivatives in our statements of operations 
we used the option pricing method to value the embedded derivative 
we used the black scholes options pricing model to estimate the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the series a preferred stock 
the black scholes options pricing model requires the development and use of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected volatility of the value of our equity  the expected conversion date  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the estimated fair value of our equity 
the expected volatility of our equity was estimated based on the volatility of the value of the equity of publicly traded companies in a similar industry and general stage of development as us 
the expected term of the conversion option was based on the period remaining until the contractually stipulated redemption date of february  the risk free interest rate is based on the yield on united states treasury strips with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the conversion option 
the development of the estimated fair value of our equity is discussed below in the valuation of the company s equity 
the significant assumptions utilized in our valuation of the embedded derivative are as follows january  december  december  february  expected volatility risk free rate the estimated fair values of the conversion feature embedded in the series a preferred stock was recorded as a derivative liability 
the derivative liability was adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as change in fair value of series a preferred stock embedded derivative 
the impact of the change in the value of the embedded derivative was not included in the determination of taxable income 
valuation of seneca holdco  llc liability 
on january   we acquired the seneca facility pursuant to the exercise of its call option and the seneca holdco liability no longer exists 
see note acquisitions and equity transactions to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the transaction 
in connection with the agreements under which we leased the seneca facility see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements  we had the option to purchase  or call option  and seneca holdco had the option to require us to purchase  or put option  the membership interest of landlord whose assets consist primarily of a biodiesel plant located in seneca  illinois 
both the put option and the call option had a term of seven years and were exercisable by either party at a price based on a pre defined formula 
we valued the amounts financed by seneca holdco  the put option and the call option using an option pricing model 
the fair values of the put option and the call option were estimated using an option pricing model  and 
table of contents represent the probability weighted present value of the gain that is realized upon exercise of each option 
the option pricing model requires the development and use of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include i the value of our equity  ii expectations regarding future changes in the value of our equity  iii expectations about the probability of either option being exercised  including the our ability to list our securities on an exchange or complete a public offering and iv an appropriate risk free rate 
we considered current public equity markets  relevant regulatory issues  biodiesel industry conditions and our position within the industry when estimating the probability that we will raise additional capital 
differences in the estimated probability and timing of this event along with current available working capital may significantly impact the fair value assigned to the seneca holdco  llc liability as we determined it was not likely that the put option will become exercisable in the absence of this event 
the significant assumptions utilized in our valuation of the seneca holdco  llc liability were as follows december  december  april  expected volatility risk free rate probability of ipo preferred stock accretion 
beginning october   we determined that there was a more than remote likelihood that our then outstanding preferred stock would become redeemable  therefore  commenced accretion of the carrying value of the series a preferred stock over the period until the earliest redemption date to the series a preferred stock s redemption value  plus accrued but unpaid dividends using the effective interest method 
this determination was based upon the current state of the public equity markets which restricted our ability to execute a qualified public offering  our historical operating results and the volatility in the biodiesel and renewable fuels industries which have resulted in lower projected profitability 
prior to october   we had determined that it was not probable that the preferred stock would become redeemable  therefore  the carrying value was not adjusted in accordance with asc topic s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  or asc topic s on february   after issuance of the series a preferred stock  we determined that there was a more than remote likelihood that the series a preferred stock would become redeemable and we commenced accretion of the carrying value of the series a preferred stock over the period until the earliest redemption date february  to the series a preferred stock s redemption value  plus dividends  using the effective interest method 
this determination was based upon the state of the public equity markets at the time which restricted our ability to execute a qualified public offering  our historical operating results and the volatility in the biodiesel and renewable fuels industries 
accretion of  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  has been recognized as a reduction to income available to common stockholders in accordance with paragraph of asc topic s on january   in connection with our ipo  the series a preferred stock was converted into a combination of shares of series b preferred stock and class a common stock 
accretion of the series a preferred stock was terminated at the time of the conversion 
we recorded the series b preferred stock at fair value  which was a premium over its redemption value  therefore  no accretion is recorded for the series b preferred stock 
valuation of the company s equity 
since quoted market prices for our securities were not available prior to the commencement of trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on january   we estimated the fair value of our equity based on the best information available at the time of the valuation 
stock based compensation 
we maintain a stock based compensation program for employees and directors under the amended and restated stock incentive plan  or our plan

our total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gallons sold as follows biodiesel 
biodiesel revenues including government incentives increased million  or  to  million during the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase in biodiesel revenues was due to an increase in gallons sold

table of contents during the year ended december  the increase in gallons for the year ended december  accounted for a revenue increase of million using pricing for the year we did not toll manufacture any gallons in for others  compared to when we tolled million gallons at the reg houston facility 
this increase in gallons sold reflects increased production capacity at our seneca facility and the albert lea facility 
the million decrease in biodiesel government incentives for the year ended december  was due to the blenders tax credit expiring on december  the credit was reinstated on january  retroactively for through december  services 
services revenues remained unchanged from the prior year 
service revenues were million for the year ended december  and this was due to our decision to cancel our remaining mosas during costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with the increase in gallons sold in the period as follows biodiesel 
biodiesel costs of goods sold increased million  or  to for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in biodiesel costs of goods sold is primarily the result of the additional gallons sold in the period partially offset by slightly lower feedstock prices in as compared to average lower cost feedstocks prices for the year ended december  was per pound  compared to per pound for the year ended december  soybean oil costs for the year ended december  was per pound  and was per pound for the year ended december  we had losses of million from risk management trading activity for the year ended december   compared to gains of million from risk management trading for the year ended december   respectively 
our increased losses were largely due to a decrease in soybean oil prices in september and an increase in heating oil prices during the third quarter of which resulted in reduced market value of our derivative financial instruments related to fourth quarter biodiesel sales 
in addition  the decrease in the value of rins during resulted in a million write down to lower of cost or market on rin inventory held throughout the year 
services 
costs of services increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  costs incurred to perform services under the mosas decreased due to our decision to cancel the mosas during selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  sg a expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the additional non cash stock compensation expense of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we also incurred a million increase in insurance expense  a million increase in advertising and an increase of million related to computer expenses 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in the provision for bad debt expense and a decrease of million in professional fee expense

other income expense  net 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to other expense of million for the year ended december  other income is primarily comprised of the changes in fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion feature embedded derivative  changes in fair value of seneca holdco liability  interest expense  interest income and the other non operating items 
the change in fair value of the series a preferred stock conversion feature embedded derivative resulted in million of income for the year ended december  and million of income for the year ended december  the change in fair value of the seneca holdco liability was million of revenue for the year ended december  and was million of expense for the year ended december  interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year 
table of contents ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the amortization expense associated with debt financing fees taken during the year compared to  as well as the decrease in term debt for the same period 
income tax benefit expense 
there was income tax expense recorded during the year ended december  of million  compared to an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  during  deferred tax liabilities were recorded as a result of the blackhawk merger and cie asset acquisition 
as the deferred tax liabilities were recorded  the resulting decrease in net deferred tax assets required a lower valuation allowance 
the release of the associated valuation allowance recorded after finalization of the blackhawk and cie purchase accounting transactions resulted in an income tax benefit for the year ended december  during the third quarter  we revised our forecasted taxable income for year end and projected we would incur an income tax liability for the twelve months ending december  the forecasted income tax liability results from a significant increase in taxable income  as well as  limitations on our ability to utilize our entire carry forward net operating losses in at december   we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million with a valuation allowance of million  partially offset by an accrued liability of million for uncertain tax benefits 
we have an income tax receivable of million as of december  income loss from equity investments 
there was no gain or loss from equity investments during compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  the change is due to the change of investments from equity method to cost method during the last half of coupled with a gain of from our investment in soymor biodiesel when we purchased the assets of soymor during july effects of recapitalization 
in january  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
due to the ipo  we recorded the effects from recapitalization of million 
to account for the exchange of series a preferred stock for the newly issued series b preferred stock and common stock  we compared the fair value of the series b preferred stock and common shares issued to the carrying amount of the series a preferred shares that were redeemed 
the excess of the carrying amount of series a preferred stock that were redeemed over the fair value of the series b preferred stock and common shares that were issued was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and was added to net earnings available to common shareholders 
preferred stock accretion 
preferred stock accretion was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  associated with the series a preferred stock that was terminated upon completion of the ipo

this was partially offset by principal payments in connection with the note payable and cash paid for debt issuance 
capital expenditures 
we have three partially constructed plants  one near new orleans  louisiana  one in emporia  kansas and one in clovis  new mexico 
we expect it will require additional investments of approximately to million in the aggregate  excluding working capital requirements  before these plants would be able to commence production 
we also acquired a biodiesel facility near atlanta  georgia  on november  that had been idled prior to our acquisition and will remain so until certain repairs or upgrades are made 
these facilities would add an expected mmgy 
our clovis plant is currently being operated as a terminal facility to fulfill biodiesel contracts for customers in the southwest 
in order to complete construction of these facilities  we plan to make significant capital expenditures when debt or equity financing becomes available to complete construction of two facilities  our new orleans facility and our emporia facility 
we are upgrading our albert lea facility and our new boston facility and expect our capital expenditures related to these facility upgrades to be approximately million and million  respectively 
we also plan to undertake various facility upgrades to further expand processing capabilities at our existing facilities 
we may enter into additional tolling arrangements with third parties from time to time where third parties will produce biodiesel on our behalf using our feedstocks 
such arrangements may require investments of additional working capital during the tolling periods 
we continue to be in discussions with lenders in an effort to enter into equity and debt financing arrangements to meet our projected financial needs for facilities under construction and capital improvement projects for our operating facilities 
since these discussions are ongoing  we are uncertain when or if financing will be available 
the financing may consist of common or preferred stock  debt  project financing or a combination of these financing techniques 
additional debt would likely increase our leverage and interest costs and would likely be secured by certain of our assets 
additional equity or equity linked financings would likely have a dilutive effect on our existing and future stockholders 
it is likely that the terms of any project financing would include customary financial and other covenants on our project subsidiaries  including restrictions on the ability to make distributions  to guarantee indebtedness and to incur liens on the plants of such subsidiaries 
series b preferred stock in connection with the recapitalization of our capital stock  we issued an aggregate of three million shares of series b preferred stock to former holders of our series a preferred stock

we may  at our option  defer a regularly scheduled dividend payment and instead pay accumulated and unpaid dividends on the following dividend payment date  however  we may only defer two such dividend payments and may not defer consecutive dividend payments 
we may pay any dividend in cash  by delivering shares of common stock  or through any combination of cash and shares of common stock 
if we elect to make any such payment by delivering shares of common stock  those shares will 
table of contents be valued at the average of the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the record date for that dividend 
during  we paid our june and december dividend payments which totaled million 
on june   each holder of our series b preferred stock may require us to redeem their shares of series b preferred stock at a price per share equal to per share plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends

adjusted ebitda we use earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain additional items  identified in the table below  or adjusted ebitda  as a supplemental performance measure 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors in analyzing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate  assess and benchmark our financial performance on a consistent and a comparable basis and as a factor in determining incentive compensation for our executives

adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity or profitability 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for any of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital assets or the impact of certain cash clauses that we consider not to be an indication of our ongoing operations  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law  which reinstated a set of tax extender items including the reinstatement of the federal biodiesel blenders tax credit for and retroactively reinstated credit for the retroactive credit for results in an estimated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents in short term investments in money market funds 
commodity price risk over the period from january through december  average diesel prices based on platts reported pricing for group midwest have ranged from a high of approximately per gallon reported in july to a low of approximately per gallon in march  with prices averaging per gallon during this period

higher feedstock prices or lower biodiesel prices result in lower profit margins and  therefore  represent unfavorable market conditions 
traditionally  we have not been able to pass along increased feedstock prices to our biodiesel customers 
the availability and price of feedstocks are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions during the growing season  rendering volumes  carry over from the previous crop year and current crop year yield  governmental policies with respect to agriculture and supply and demand 

table of contents we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our sales contracts  lower cost feedstock requirements  soybean oil requirements and the related exchange traded contracts for market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value  resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the fair value of our lower cost feedstock and soybean oil requirements and biodiesel sales 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows volume in millions units hypothetical adverse change in price annual gross profit in millions percentage change in gross profit biodiesel gallons lower cost feedstocks  pounds soybean oil pounds we attempt to protect operating margins by entering into risk management contracts that mitigate price volatility of our feedstocks  such as inedible animal fat and inedible corn oil and energy prices 
we create offsetting positions by using a combination of forward physical purchases and sales contracts on feedstock and biodiesel  including risk management futures contracts  swaps and options primarily on heating oil and soybean oil  however  the extent to which we engage in risk management activities varies substantially from time to time  and from feedstock to feedstock  depending on market conditions and other factors 
a percent adverse change in the prices of heating oil would have a negative effect on the fair value of these instruments of million 
a percent adverse change in the price of soybean oil would have a negative effect on the fair value of these instruments of million 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our million loan from the proceeds of variable rate demand industrial development revenue bonds  or ifa bonds  issued by the iowa finance authority to finance our ralston facility

inflation to date  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results  though costs for petroleum based diesel fuel  feedstocks  construction  labor  taxes  repairs  maintenance and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures 
inflationary pressure in the future could affect our ability to sell the biodiesel we produce  maintain our production facilities adequately  build new biodiesel production facilities and expand our existing facilities as well as the demand for our facility construction management and operations management services
