item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading provider of business management solutions  combining human resource outsourcing and professional management consulting to create an operational platform that differentiates us from our competitors 
our integrated platform is grounded in expertise in payroll processing  employee benefits  workers compensation coverage  risk management and workplace safety programs  and human resource administration 
we provide business management solutions to small and mid sized businesses 
we generate staffing services revenues primarily from short term staffing  contract staffing  on site management and direct placement services 
our client services fees are generated from contractual agreements with our peo clients  we enter into a co employment arrangement in which we become the administrative employer and the client maintains care  custody and control of their operations 
we recognize revenues from our staffing services for all amounts invoiced  including direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues from co employment agreements are recognized on a net basis in accordance with current accounting guidance for revenue recognition and principal agent considerations 
consequently  our peo service fee revenues represent the gross margin generated from our peo services after deducting the amounts invoiced to co employed clients for direct payroll expenses such as salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment 
these amounts are also excluded from cost of revenues 
peo service fees also include amounts invoiced to our clients for employer payroll related taxes and workers compensation coverage 
through centralized operations at our headquarters in vancouver  washington  we prepare invoices weekly for our staffing services customers and following the end of each payroll processing cycle for clients under a client services agreement 
we invoice our customers and clients as each payroll is processed 
payment terms for staffing customers are generally days  while co employed clients invoices are generally due on the invoice date 
our business is concentrated in california and oregon and we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from these markets in the future 
revenues generated in our california and oregon offices accounted for of our total net revenues in  in and in consequently  any weakness in economic conditions or changes in the regulatory environments in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal and state unemployment taxes  and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with our self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  
table of contents claims administration fees  legal fees  state administrative agency fees and excess insurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
we also maintain separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where we are not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to us  our respective independent tpa or our internal claims management personnel analyze the details of the injury and develop a case reserve  which becomes the estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and their professional judgment 
we then record or accrue an expense and a corresponding liability based upon our estimate of the ultimate claim cost 
as cash payments are made by our tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa and our in house claims administrators also review existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjust the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
our reserve includes a provision for both future anticipated increases in costs adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods together ibnr 
this provision of the reserve is based upon an actuarial estimate provided by our independent actuary 
we believe our operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  professional and legal fees and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive compensation 
depreciation and amortization represents depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets consisting of the amortization of software costs  covenants not to compete  and if material  customer related intangibles 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to years 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents self insured workers compensation reserves 
we are self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of our employee work sites in oregon  california  maryland  delaware and colorado and for staffing services and management employees only in washington 
additionally  effective march   our employees working in arizona were eligible for coverage through ecole 
the estimated liability for unsettled workers compensation claims represents our best estimate  which includes an evaluation of information provided by our internal claims adjusters and our third party claims administrators  coupled with management s use of an independent actuary 
these elements serve as the basis for our overall estimate for workers compensation claims liabilities  which include more specifically the following components case reserve estimates for reported losses  plus additional amounts for estimated future development of reported claims and incurred but not reported claims together ibnr 
our estimates also include amounts for unallocated loss adjustment expenses  including legal costs 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments to liabilities are reflected in current operating results as they become known 
we believe that the amounts recorded for our estimated liabilities  which are based upon facts and other trends associated with the company s historical universe of claims data  are reasonable and objective 
nevertheless  it is possible that adjustments to such estimates may be required in future periods if the development of claim costs varies materially from our estimates and such adjustments  if necessary  could be material to results of operations 
safety incentives liability 
our accrued safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon the expected payout as determined by historical incentive payment trends 
the safety incentive expense is netted against peo revenues on our statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicates there was no impairment as of december  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
investments in marketable securities 
we consider available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments  including the duration and extent to which fair value 
table of contents is less than cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
investments in securities classified as trading are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
in the event a loss on our available for sale investments is determined to be other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our statement of operations 
investments in securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
income taxes 
our income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach 
this requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the impact of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge  if any  from taxing authorities 
at december   we had deferred income tax assets of million we assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
the amount of the deferred income tax assets actually realized could vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if our operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions  our long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by selected items in the company s statements of operations for the years ended december   and  included in item of this report

table of contents we report peo revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the services provided by our co employed clients to their customers pursuant to our client service agreements 
we present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the years ended december  and set forth in the table below 
although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management believes this information is more informative as to the level of our business activity and more illustrative of how we manage our operations  including the preparation of our internal operating forecasts  because it presents our peo services on a basis comparable to our staffing services 
the presentation of revenues on a net basis and the relative contributions of staffing and peo services revenues can create volatility in our gross margin percentage 
the general impact of fluctuations in our revenue mix is described below 
a relative increase in peo services revenue will result in higher gross margin percentage 
improvement in gross margin percentage occurs because incremental client services revenue dollars are reported as revenue net of all related direct costs 
a relative increase in staffing revenues will typically result in a lower gross margin percentage 
staffing revenues are presented at gross with the related direct costs reported in cost of sales 
while staffing relationships typically have higher margins than co employment relationships  an increase in staffing revenues and related costs presented at gross dilutes the impact of the net peo services revenue on gross margin percentage

table of contents customer base compared to and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for  was principally due to a relative shift in business mix to peo services  as to which payroll taxes and benefits are presented at gross cost while the related direct payroll costs are netted against peo services revenue and to higher effective state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operated in as compared to workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  increased from in to in the increase in the percentage rate was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for claim costs related to current year claims and increases in estimated costs to close prior year claims and higher insurance broker commissions resulting from increased workers compensation insurance rates 
we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as changes to our estimates for workers compensation claims liabilities  as necessary 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses relating to the operation of our headquarters and our branch offices and the marketing of our services

fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as a seasonality  wage limits on statutory payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand for our services and competition and the effect of acquisitions 
payroll taxes  as a component of cost of revenues  generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and social security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis 
our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture  food processing and forest products related industries 
in addition  revenues in the fourth quarter may be affected by many customers practice of operating on holiday shortened schedules 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated worker s compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of million at december  decreased million compared to december   which compares to an increase of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash at december   as compared to december   was primarily due to the repurchase of the company s common stock for an amount totaling million which included the redemption of million of preferred shares issued during to finance the repurchase and an increase in accounts receivable of million  offset in part by net income of million  a million increase in workers compensation claims liabilities  an increase in accrued payroll  payroll taxes and related benefits of million and the issuance of net debt totaling million

table of contents during september  california senate bill sb  designed to reform california s workers compensation system  was signed into law 
section of section of sb was added to the labor code and includes a provision whereby the california director of self insurance the director is required not to issue certificates of consent to self insure after january  to any employer engaged in the activities of a professional employer organization  a leasing employer  a temporary services employer or any employer the director determines to be in the business of providing employees to other employers 
additionally  a certificate of consent to self insure that previously had been issued to any employer engaged in these types of activities is required to be revoked by the director not later than january  if the company  which has a certificate of consent to self insure in place  is not be able to secure alternatives to address the impact of sb on the company s ability to continue its self insurance program in california  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
while no assurances can be made  we do not anticipate that our certificate of consent to self insure in the state of california will be revoked by the director significantly before the january  deadline 
we are currently exploring several potential alternatives to address the impact of sb on our ability to continue our self insurance program in california 
the company is considering the possibility of licensing ecole as an insurer in california 
one or more of these potential alternatives could require us to increase the capitalization of our wholly owned fully licensed insurance subsidiary  ecole  increase the amount of restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheet  increase our borrowing through our principal bank  or obtain additional funding from other sources 
the company is self insured for certain business insurance risks such as general liability  errors and omissions and umbrella coverage 
management may explore in the future whether to pursue other vehicles to provide coverage including coverages provided by the company s captive insurance companies 
management expects that the funds anticipated to be generated from operations  current liquid assets  and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december   including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements  long term workers compensation liabilities for catastrophic injuries  long term debt  and other long term liabilities  are summarized below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries long term debt other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio of liquid assets and its outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and long term debt 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted principally of approximately million in tax exempt money market funds  million in tax exempt municipal bonds  and approximately million in corporate bonds 
the company s outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and long term debt totaled approximately million at december  based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio of liquid assets  its outstanding borrowings or its results of operations because of the predominantly short maturities of the securities within the investment portfolio and the relative size of the outstanding borrowings
