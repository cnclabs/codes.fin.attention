item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure under section r d iii of the exchange act 
if we fail to comply with export control regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or other sanctions 
some of our products manufactured or assembled in the united states are subject to the us export administration regulations  administered by the us department of commerce  bureau of industry and security  which require that an export license is obtained before such products can be exported to certain countries 
additionally  some of our products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations  which restrict the export of certain military or intelligence related items  technologies and services to non us persons 
failure to comply with these laws could harm our business by subjecting us to sanctions by the us government  including substantial monetary penalties  denial of export privileges and debarment from us government contracts 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our sales are derived from international operations 
we are subject to specific risks associated with international operations 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately of our sales from operations outside of the us and we have principal manufacturing facilities in non us countries 
sales from international operations  export sales and the use of manufacturing facilities outside of the us by us are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include economic or political instability  partial or total expropriation of international assets  limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises  trade protection measures  including tariffs or import export restrictions  currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  labor and employment laws that may or may not be more restrictive than in the us  significant adverse changes in taxation policies or other laws or regulations  difficulties in hiring and maintaining qualified staff  and the disruption of operations from political disturbances  terrorist activities  insurrection or war 
if any of these risks were to materialize  they may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our employees represented by trade unions or works councils engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown or if the representation committees responsible for negotiating with such trade unions or works councils are unsuccessful in negotiating new and acceptable agreements when the existing agreements with employees covered by collective bargaining expire  we could experience business disruptions or increased costs 
as of december   approximately of our employees were represented by a number of different trade unions and works councils 
further  as of that date  we had approximately  employees  representing of our worldwide employee base  in foreign locations 
in canada  australia and various countries in europe  asia  and central and south america  by law  certain of our employees are represented by a number of different trade unions and works councils  which subject us to employment arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements 
further  the laws of certain foreign countries may place restrictions on our ability to take certain employee related actions or require that we conduct additional negotiations with trade unions  works councils or other governmental authorities before we can take such actions 
if our employees represented by trade unions or works councils were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown in the future  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations 
such disruption could interfere with our business operations and could lead to decreased productivity  increased labor costs and lost revenue 
the representation committees that negotiate with the foreign trade unions or works councils on our behalf may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or other employment arrangements when the current ones expire 
furthermore  future labor negotiations could result in significant increases in our labor costs 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing business is subject to the possibility of product liability lawsuits  which could harm our business 
as the manufacturer of equipment for use in industrial markets  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims 
our products may not be free from defects 
in addition  some of our products contain components manufactured by third parties  which may also have defects 
we maintain insurance coverage for product liability claims 
the insurance policies have limits  however  that may not be sufficient to cover claims made 
in addition  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost 
with respect to components manufactured by third party suppliers  the contractual indemnification that we seek from our third party suppliers may be limited and thus insufficient to cover claims made against us 
if insurance coverage or contractual indemnification is insufficient to satisfy product liability claims made against us the claims could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even claims without merit could harm our reputation  reduce demand for our products  cause us to incur substantial legal costs and distract the attention of our management 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as manufacturers  we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws for which compliance  or liabilities that arise as a result of noncompliance  could be costly 
our businesses are subject to international  federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing emissions of regulated air pollutants  discharges of wastewater and storm water  storage and handling of raw materials  generation  storage  transportation and disposal of regulated wastes  and worker safety 
these requirements impose on our businesses certain responsibilities  including the obligation to obtain and maintain various environmental permits 
if we were to fail to comply with these requirements or fail to obtain or maintain a required permit  we could be subject to penalties and be required to undertake corrective action measures to achieve compliance 
in addition  if our noncompliance with such regulations were to result in a release of hazardous materials to the environment  such as soil or groundwater  we could be required to remediate such contamination  which could be costly 
moreover  noncompliance could subject us to private claims for property damage or personal injury based on exposure to hazardous materials or unsafe working conditions 
in addition  changes in applicable requirements or stricter interpretation of existing requirements may result in costly compliance requirements or otherwise subject us to future liabilities 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as the present or former owner or operator of real property  or generator of waste  we could become subject to liability for environmental contamination  regardless of whether we caused such contamination 
under various federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances  and  in some instances  international laws  relating to the protection of the environment  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination on  under  or released from such property and for any damage to natural resources resulting from such contamination 
similarly  a generator of waste can be held responsible for contamination resulting from the treatment or disposal of such waste at any off site location such as a landfill  regardless of whether the generator arranged for the treatment or disposal of the waste in compliance with applicable laws 
costs associated with liability for removal or remediation of contamination or damage to natural resources could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the responsible party knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contaminants 
in addition  the liability may be joint and several 
moreover  the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties  or properties for which we are deemed responsible  may expose us to liability for property damage or personal injury  or materially adversely affect our ability to sell our real property interests or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
we could be subject to environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations that have resulted or will result in contamination 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights or challenges to these rights by third parties may affect our operations and financial performance 
the market for many of our products is  in part  dependent upon patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  agreements with employees  customers and other third parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights  and the goodwill engendered by our trademarks and trade names 
the protection of these intellectual property rights is therefore material to a portion of our businesses 
the failure to protect these rights may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
it may be particularly difficult to enforce our intellectual property rights in countries where such rights are not highly developed or protected 
any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention 
as a result of any such litigation  we could lose any proprietary rights we have 
in addition  third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly and time consuming defense actions and  should defenses not be successful  may result in the payment of damages  redesign of affected products  entry into settlement or license agreements  or a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing  marketing or selling certain of our products 
it is also possible that others will independently develop technology that will compete with our patented or unpatented technology 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key leadership could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business 
we may be adversely affected if we lose members of our senior leadership 
we are highly dependent on our senior leadership team as a result of their expertise in our industry and our business 
the loss of key leadership or the inability to attract  retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the deutsche bank credit agreement contains restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business 
the deutsche bank credit agreement contains various covenants that will limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
these covenants would limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of  the capital stock of colfax and its wholly owned subsidiaries  make certain investments  create liens on certain assets to secure debt  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  under the deutsche bank credit agreement  we are required to satisfy and maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
the deutsche bank credit agreement various covenants and the additional leverage taken on by us could increase our vulnerability to general economic slowdowns which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any impairment in the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
the goodwill results from our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired 
we assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets 
if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels  if competing or alternative technologies emerge  or if market conditions for businesses acquired declines  we could incur  under current applicable accounting rules  a non cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and total capitalization  the effect of which could be material 
our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical and death benefit plans are or may become subject to funding requirements or obligations that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical and death benefit plans for our current and former employees worldwide 
each plan funding position is affected by the investment performance of the plan investments  changes in the fair value of the plan assets  the type of investments  the life expectancy of the plan members  changes in the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan liabilities  changes in the rate of inflation and interest rates  our financial position  as well as other changes in economic conditions 
furthermore  since a significant proportion of the plans assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities  they are  and will be  affected by market risks 
any detrimental change in any of the above factors is likely to worsen the funding position of each of the relevant plans  and this is likely to require the plans sponsoring employers to increase the contributions currently made to the plans to satisfy our obligations 
any requirement to increase the level of contributions currently made could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
during the year ended december   approximately of our sales were derived from operations outside the us a significant portion of our revenues and income are denominated in foreign currencies 
large fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the currency exchange rates may impact the financial results positively or negatively in one period and not another  which may make it difficult to compare our operating results from different periods 
we also face exchange risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the us and from intercompany transactions between affiliates 
although we use the u 
s dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes  we have manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies 
costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar 
in particular  the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies 
although a significant portion of this difference is hedged  when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  operating profits are increased or decreased  respectively 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we are dependent on the availability of raw materials  as well as parts and components used in our products 
while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products  we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase parts and components from suppliers 
the availability and prices for raw materials  parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers  changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels 
any significant change in the supply of  or price for  these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  delays in delivery of components or raw materials by suppliers could cause delays in our delivery of products to our customers 
our information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions  data corruption  cyber based attacks or network security breaches  which could result in the disruption of operations or the loss of data confidentiality 
we rely on information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information  and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities  including procurement  manufacturing  distribution  invoicing and collection 
these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage  disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software  databases or components  power outages  hardware failures or computer viruses 
in addition  we may be subject to cyber based attacks and security breaches  which could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or damage to our information technology networks and systems if our efforts to mitigate or otherwise contain any attacks or breaches are unsuccessful 
if these information technology systems suffer severe damage  disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be subject to risks arising from changes in technology 
the supply chains in which we operate are subject to technological changes and changes in customer requirements 
we may not successfully develop new or modified types of products or technologies that may be required by our customers in the future 
further  the development of new technologies by competitors that may compete with our technologies could reduce demand for our products and affect our financial performance 
should we not be able to maintain or enhance the competitive values of our products or develop and introduce new products or technologies successfully  or if new products or technologies fail to generate sufficient revenues to offset research and development costs  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have superior resources 
if we are unable to respond successfully to this competition  this could reduce our sales and operating margins 
we sell most of our products in highly fragmented and competitive markets 
we believe that the principal elements of competition in our markets are the ability to meet customer specifications  application expertise and design and engineering capabilities  product quality and brand name  timeliness of delivery  price  and quality of aftermarket sales and support 
in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position  we intend to continue investing in manufacturing quality  marketing  customer service and support and distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments and we may not be able to maintain our competitive position 
our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services  or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
some of our competitors may have greater financial  marketing and research and development resources than we have 
as a result  those competitors may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
in addition  pricing pressures could cause us to lower the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
if we fail to compete successfully  the failure may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 
our future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors including  among others  changes in the tax rates  rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we generate income or the repatriation of income held in foreign jurisdictions 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  includes million held in jurisdictions outside the us  which may be subject to tax penalties and other restrictions if repatriated into the us an increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our after tax results of operations 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal  state and local tax authorities and by us tax authorities 
if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded  our future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments 
risks and other considerations related to our common stock the issuances of additional common and preferred stock or the resale of previously restricted common stock may adversely affect the market price of colfax common stock 
in connection with the charter acquisition  we issued a total of  shares of colfax common stock to bdt cf acquisition vehicle  llc the bdt investor  mitchell p 
rales  steven m 
rales and markel corporation collectively  the investors and  shares of colfax series a preferred stock  which are initially convertible into an additional  shares of colfax common stock  to the bdt investor 
pursuant to registration rights agreements we entered into with the investors in january  the investors and their permitted transferees have registration rights for the resale of the shares of colfax common stock acquired as a result of the charter acquisition and  with respect to the bdt investor  shares of colfax common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock 
in april  we filed a prospectus supplement under which the investors may resell these shares 
in addition  mitchell p 
rales and steven m 
rales have registration rights for the resale of certain shares of colfax common stock pursuant to a registration rights agreement  as amended 
these registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market  and any such resale would increase the number of shares of colfax common stock available for public trading 
sales by the bdt investor  markel  mitchell p 
rales or steven m 
rales or their permitted transferees of a substantial number of shares of colfax common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of colfax common stock 
in march  we sold  shares of newly issued common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  there are additional authorized shares of colfax common stock  which  if subsequently issued  could have a further dilutive effect on outstanding colfax common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that grant the bdt investor certain rights which may limit our flexibility in operating our business and structuring our corporate governance 
so long as the bdt investor and its permitted transferees beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the series a preferred stock issued to the bdt investor under the securities purchase agreement with the bdt investor the bdt purchase agreement  the bdt investor written consent is required in order for us to take certain corporate actions  including the incurrence of certain indebtedness excluding certain permitted indebtedness if the ratio of such indebtedness to ebitda as defined in the deutsche bank credit agreement exceeds certain specified ratios  measured by reference to the last twelve month period for which financial information is reported by colfax pro forma for acquisitions during such period  the issuance of any shares of preferred stock  any change to our dividend policy or the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution on any of our stock ranking subordinate or junior to the series a preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions including the colfax common stock under certain circumstances  any voluntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up of colfax  any change in our independent auditor  the election of anyone other than mr 
mitchell p 
rales as chairman of our board of directors  any acquisition of another entity or assets for a purchase price exceeding of our equity market capitalization  any merger  consolidation  reclassification  joint venture or strategic partnership or similar transaction  or any disposition of any assets excluding sale leaseback transactions and other financing transactions in the ordinary course of business of colfax if the value of the resulting entity  level of investment by colfax or value of the assets disposed  as applicable  exceeds of our equity market capitalization  any amendments to our organizational or governing documents  including the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws  and any change in the size of our board of directors 
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that  so long as the bdt investor and certain permitted transferees beneficially own at least of the colfax common stock on a fully diluted basis  the bdt investor written consent is required to alter  amend or repeal the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation which sets forth the authorized number of members of our board and the bdt investor nomination rights in respect of members of our board 
the above factors could limit our financial and operational flexibility  and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the bdt investor may exercise significant influence over us  including through its ability to elect up to two members of our board of directors 
the shares of colfax common stock and series a preferred stock owned by the bdt investor represent approximately of the voting rights in respect of the company issued share capital 
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the bdt investor consent is required before we may take certain actions for so long as the bdt investor and its permitted transferees beneficially own in the aggregate at least of the series a preferred stock issued pursuant to the bdt purchase agreement as discussed above 
as a result  the bdt investor may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders 
the bdt investor may have interests that diverge from  or even conflict with  those of colfax and our other stockholders 
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the bdt investor will have the right to exclusively nominate two out of eleven directors to our board of directors so long as the bdt investor holds at least of the outstanding colfax common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis  assuming conversion of the series a preferred stock at the then existing conversion price  with one of its nominees to serve on the audit committee of our board of directors and one of its nominees to serve on the compensation committee of our board of directors  and one out of ten directors to our board of directors so long as the bdt investor and its permitted transferees beneficially own in the aggregate less than but more than of the outstanding colfax common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis  assuming conversion of the series a preferred stock at the then existing conversion price  with such nominee to serve on the audit committee and the compensation committee of our board of directors 
further  so long as the bdt investor and certain permitted transferees beneficially own at least of the colfax common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis  assuming conversion of the series a preferred stock at the then existing conversion price  the bdt investor s written consent is required to alter  amend or repeal the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation which sets forth the authorized number of members of our board and the bdt investor s nomination rights in respect of members of our board 
in addition  the percentage of colfax common stock owned by the bdt investor  mitchell p 
rales and steven m 
rales and the governance rights of the bdt investor could discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning colfax 
provisions in our governing documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of colfax  which could decrease the value of its shares 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws  and delaware law contain provisions that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include prohibiting stockholders from taking action by written consent  prohibiting special meetings of stockholders called by stockholders and prohibiting stockholder nominations and approvals without complying with specific advance notice requirements 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which our board of directors could use to effect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of colfax 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between colfax and any holder of or more of its outstanding voting stock 
although the bdt investor holds more than of our outstanding voting stock  this provision of delaware law does not apply to it

overview please see part i  item business for a discussion of colfax s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value 
upon the closing of the charter acquisition  we changed the composition of our reportable segments to reflect the changes in our internal organization resulting from the integration of the acquired businesses 
we now report our operations through the following reportable segments gas fluid handling a global supplier of a broad range of gas and fluid handling products  including pumps  fluid handling systems and controls  specialty valves  heavy duty centrifugal and axial fans  rotary heat exchangers and gas compressors  which serves customers in the power generation  oil  gas and petrochemical  mining  marine including defense and general industrial and other end markets  and fabrication technology a global supplier of welding equipment and consumables  cutting equipment and consumables and automated welding and cutting systems 
certain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading corporate and other 
colfax has a global geographic footprint  with production facilities in europe  north america  south america  asia  australia and africa 
through our reportable segments  we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third party distribution channels 
our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial  industrial and government customers 
we employ a comprehensive set of tools that we refer to as cbs 
cbs  modeled on the danaher business system  is our business management system 
it is a repeatable  teachable process that we use to create superior value for our customers  shareholders and associates 
rooted in our core values  it is our culture 
cbs provides the tools and techniques to ensure that we are continuously improving our ability to meet or exceed customer requirements on a consistent basis 
outlook we believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base 
our business mix is expected to be well balanced between long and short cycle businesses  sales in emerging markets and developed nations and fore and aftermarket products and services 
given this balance  management no longer uses indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company 
instead  the individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers  including to the extent possible their sales  to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future 
as a result of the charter acquisition  we face a number of challenges and opportunities  including the successful integration  application and expansion of our cbs tools to improve margins and working capital management  rationalization of assets and back office functions  and consolidation of manufacturing facilities 
we expect to continue to grow as a result of strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the future 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented 
the company s management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net sales and segment operating income loss  which represents operating income loss before restructuring and other related charges 
items affecting the comparability of our reported results our financial performance and growth are driven by many factors  principally our ability to serve global markets  fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the us dollar  general economic conditions  the global economy and capital spending levels  the availability of capital  our estimates concerning the availability of insurance proceeds to cover asbestos litigation expense and liabilities  the amount of asbestos liabilities and litigation expense  the impact of restructuring initiatives  our ability to pass cost increases on through pricing  the impact of sales mix  and our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions 
these key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future 
global operations our products and services are available worldwide 
the manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region 
during  approximately of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the us accordingly  we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world 
our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations  including efficiently utilizing our global sales  manufacturing and distribution capabilities  the expansion of market opportunities in asia  successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets 
however  we believe that our geographic  end market and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results 
foreign currency fluctuations a significant portion of our net sales  approximately for the year ended december  is derived from operations outside the us  with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the us  a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion 
economic conditions demand for our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures depends  in turn  on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost 
while demand can be cyclical  we believe the charter acquisition has diversified our operations and limits the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results 
seasonality as our gas and fluid handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year  historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter 
also  all of our european operations typically experience a slowdown during the july and august holiday season 
general economic conditions may  however  impact future seasonal variations 
pricing we believe our customers place a premium on quality  reliability  availability  design and application engineering support 
our highly engineered gas and fluid handling products typically have higher margins than products with commodity like qualities 
however  we are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base 
our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel  iron  copper and aluminum 
historically  we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers 
while we seek to take actions to manage this risk  including commodity hedging where appropriate  such increased costs may adversely impact earnings 
sales and cost mix our profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors  including the type of product  the geographic location in which the product is manufactured  the end market for which the product is designed  and the percentage of total revenue represented by consumables and aftermarket sales and services 
consumables are generally sold at lower margins in comparison to our foremarket products and equipment  whereas our aftermarket business  including spare parts and other value added services  is generally a higher margin business 
during  our mix of consumables and aftermarket products and services was significantly impacted by the charter acquisition 
the mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented year ended december  foremarket and equipment aftermarket and consumables strategic acquisitions we complement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions 
acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results 
as a consequence  we report the change in our net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses 
orders and order backlog are presented only for the gas and fluid handling segment  where this information is relevant 
the discussion of net sales  orders and order backlog for in comparison to is a proforma comparison that includes the operations acquired in the charter acquisition for the comparable period of the prior year  which excludes the first days of each annual period presented 
the change in net sales due to acquisitions represents the change in sales due to the following acquisitions by both colfax and charter on october   the company completed the acquisition of approximately of the outstanding common and investment shares of soldex for approximately million the soldex acquisition 
soldex is organized under the laws of peru and complements our existing fabrication technology segment by supplying welding products from its plants in colombia and peru

as a result of this acquisition  colfax has expanded its product offerings in the industrial fan market 
in may  colfax acquired the remaining of sibes not already owned by its esab business for approximately million  including the assumption of debt 
sibes is a leading supplier of welding electrodes to customers in eastern russia and strengthens esab s position in the attractive russian welding consumables market  particularly in the energy and natural resources end markets 
on december   colfax completed the acquisition of cot puritech  inc for a total purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million which includes the fair value of estimated additional contingent cash payments of million 
the additional contingent cash payments will be paid over two years subject to the achievement of certain performance goals

the million sales growth due to existing businesses  as discussed and defined under sales  orders and backlog above  during in comparison to was primarily due to growth in all end markets  except marine 
additionally  million of acquisition related amortization expense and million increased recurring intangible amortization expense in comparison to is reflected in selling  general and administrative expense for as further discussed above  net sales increased by million  or  during compared to due to an increase in demand in all end markets  except defense 
gross profit margin for decreased compared to primarily due to lower gross margin associated with the foremarket sales of rosscor and baric during the period  partially offset by positive leverage of fixed costs given substantially higher sales volume in the acquisitions of rosscor and baric contributed million to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense during additionally  asbestos liability and defense costs increased by million during compared to fabrication technology we formulate  develop  manufacture and supply consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting and joining of steels  aluminum and other metals and metal alloys 
our fabrication technology products are principally marketed under the esab brand name  which we believe is a leading international welding company with roots dating back to the invention of the welding electrode

the million increase in gross profit during in comparison to was attributable to increases of million from existing businesses and million due to the acquisitions of rosscor and baric 
additionally  changes in foreign exchange rates had a million positive impact on gross profit for in comparison to gross profit margin for decreased compared to primarily due to the lower gross profit margin associated with the foremarket sales of rosscor and baric during the period  partially offset by positive leverage of fixed costs given substantially higher sales volume in operating expenses total company year ended december  in millions selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales charter acquisition related expense restructuring and other related charges asbestos coverage litigation expense selling  general and administrative expense increased million during in comparison to primarily due to the charter acquisition 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales during in comparison to resulted primarily from the benefit of higher sales volumes and efforts to reduce costs partially offset by million of higher intangible amortization expense 
during  we incurred million of increased advisory  legal  valuation and other professional service fees and losses on acquisition related foreign exchange derivatives in connection with the charter acquisition in comparison to restructuring and other related charges increased significantly during in comparison to the comparable period of  primarily as a result of the substantial cost reduction programs under way in the fabrication technology segment 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million during in comparison to  million of which resulted from the acquisitions of rosscor  baric and cot puritech 
selling  general and administrative expense from existing businesses increased primarily due to higher selling and commission costs and higher corporate overhead including the operation of two offices during the transition of our corporate headquarters to maryland 
additionally  asbestos liability and defense costs increased by million during compared to primarily due to a million provision related to a court judgment received for one of our subsidiaries litigation against a number of its insurers and former parent  a million pre tax charge because of a statistically significant increase in mesothelioma claims had occurred and was expected to continue to occur related to one of our subsidiaries and a million pre tax charge resulting from higher settlement values per mesothelioma claim in a specific region related to another subsidiary 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales during in comparison to resulted primarily from higher sales volumes 
interest expense total company year ended december  in millions interest expense the increase in interest expense during in comparison to was attributable to interest on the financing related to the charter acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements below for additional discussion 
provision for income taxes during  income before income taxes was million and the provision for income taxes was million 
the provision was impacted by two significant items 
upon completion of the charter acquisition  certain deferred tax assets existing at that date were reassessed in light of the impact of the acquired businesses on expected future income or loss by country and future tax planning  including the impact of the post acquisition capital structure 
this assessment resulted in an increase in our valuation allowance to provide full valuation allowances against us deferred tax assets 
the increased valuation allowances resulted in a non cash increase in the provision for income taxes for of million 
in addition  million of charter acquisition related expense and increased corporate overhead and interest expense reflected in the consolidated statement of operations are either non deductible or were incurred in jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be recognized 
these two items are the principal cause of the provision for income taxes being significantly higher than the tax provision which would result from the application of the us federal statutory rate 
the effective income tax rate for was as compared to an effective tax rate of for our effective tax rate for was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a net increase in our valuation allowance that was partially offset by foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the us tax rate and a net decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the effective tax rate for was higher than the effective tax rate for primarily due to a million net increase in our valuation allowance in compared to a net increase of million in impacting the provision for income taxes for those periods 
liquidity and capital resources overview historically  we have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit facilities discussed below 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we were successful in our efforts to raise additional funds in the form of debt and equity  as further discussed below 
we expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital  funding of acquisitions  capital expenditures  asbestos related cash outflows and funding of our pension plans 
if additional funds are needed for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes  we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity 
equity capital in connection with the financing of the charter acquisition  on january   we sold to the bdt investor i  shares of newly issued colfax common stock and ii  shares of newly created series a perpetual convertible preferred stock  referred to as the series a preferred stock  for an aggregate of million representing per share of series a preferred stock and per share of common stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement the bdt purchase agreement with the bdt investor as well as bdt capital partners fund i a  lp  and mitchell p

rales  each of whom were beneficial owners of of colfax s common stock at the time of the sale  and markel 
thomas s 
gayner  a member of colfax s board of directors  is president and chief investment officer of markel 
consideration paid to charter shareholders included shares of newly issued colfax common stock in exchange for each share of charter s ordinary stock  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock on january  in conjunction with the issuance of the common and preferred stock discussed above  the company recognized million in equity issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital during on march   we sold  shares of newly issued common stock to underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
further  on march   the underwriters of the march  equity offering exercised their over allotment option and we sold an additional  shares of newly issued common stock to the underwriters for public resale pursuant to a shelf registration statement for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in conjunction with these issuances  we recognized million in equity issuance costs which were recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital during borrowing arrangements we entered into the deutsche bank credit agreement on september  in connection with the closing of the charter acquisition  the deutsche bank credit agreement was amended on january  and we terminated our bank of america credit agreement defined and further discussed below as well as charter s outstanding indebtedness 
the deutsche bank credit agreement has four tranches of term loans i a million term a facility  ii a million term a facility  iii a million term a facility and iv a million term b facility 
in addition  the deutsche bank credit agreement has two revolving credit sub facilities which total million in commitments the revolver 
the revolver includes a million letter of credit sub facility and a million swingline loan sub facility 
the term a  term a  term a and the revolver variable rate borrowings are subject to interest payments of libor or euribor plus a margin ranging from to  determined by our leverage ratio 
borrowings under the term b facility are also variable rate and are subject to interest payments of libor plus a margin of 
the revolver is subject to a commitment fee ranging from to basis points  determined by our leverage ratio 
additionally  as of december   there was an original issue discount of million and deferred financing fees of million  which will be accreted to interest expense primarily using the effective interest method 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the deutsche bank credit agreement was and there was million available under the revolver  including million available under the letter of credit sub facility 
as of december   we were party to a credit agreement the bank of america credit agreement  led and administered by bank of america  which included a senior secured revolving credit facility and a term credit facility 
upon the early termination of the bank of america credit agreement  we incurred a total pre tax charge of million in  which includes the write off of million of deferred financing fees and million of losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for the related interest rate swap 
in connection with the deutsche bank credit agreement  we have pledged substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries assets and of the shares of certain first tier international subsidiaries as collateral against borrowings to our us companies 
in addition  subsidiaries in certain foreign jurisdictions have guaranteed our obligations on borrowings of one of our european subsidiaries  as well as pledged substantially all of their assets for such borrowings of this european subsidiary under the deutsche bank credit agreement 
the deutsche bank credit agreement contains customary covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  pay dividends  incur debt or liens  redeem or repurchase equity  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets 
in addition  the deutsche bank credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a total leverage ratio  as defined therein  of not more than to and a minimum interest coverage ratio  as defined therein  of to  measured at the end of each quarter  through the minimum interest coverage ratio increases by basis points each year beginning in until it reaches to for the maximum total leverage ratio decreases to to for and decreases by basis points for the two subsequent fiscal years until it reaches to for the deutsche bank credit agreement contains various events of default  including failure to comply with the financial covenants referenced above  and upon an event of default the lenders may  subject to various customary cure rights  require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the term loans and the revolver and foreclose on the collateral 
the company is in compliance with all such covenants as of december  we believe that our sources of liquidity  including the deutsche bank credit agreement  are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
cash flows as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from million as of december  the following table summarizes the change in cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities purchases of fixed assets  net acquisitions  net of cash received  other sources  net net cash used in investing activities  proceeds from repayments of borrowings  net  proceeds from issuance of common stock  net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock  net esab india repurchase of additional noncontrolling interest other sources uses  net net cash provided by used in financing activities  effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding and asbestos related costs 
changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below 
net cash received or paid for asbestos related costs  net of insurance proceeds  including the disposition of claims  defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers  creates variability in our operating cash flows 
we had net cash outflows of million  million and million for asbestos related costs paid  net of insurance settlements received during  and  respectively 
funding requirements of our defined benefit plans  including pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans  can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
for  and  cash contributions for defined benefit and other post employment benefit plans were million  million and million  respectively 
contributions for include million of supplemental contributions to pension plans in the united kingdom as a result of the financing of the charter acquisition 
during  and  cash payments of million  million and million  respectively were made related to our restructuring initiatives 
additionally  during and cash payments of approximately million and million  respectively  were made for advisory  legal  valuation and other professional service fees related to the charter acquisition 
changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented 
we define working capital as trade receivables  net and inventories  net reduced by accounts payable 
during  net working capital decreased  primarily due to a decrease in inventory and an increase in payable levels  which increased our cash flows from operating activities by million  a significant contributor to cash flows from operating activities 
during  net working capital increased  primarily due to an increase in receivables  which reduced our cash flows from operating activities 
a decrease in net working capital  primarily as a result of a decrease in inventories  net  positively impacted cash flows from operating activities during there were significant cash outflows from investing activities associated with the charter acquisition in the cash cost of the charter acquisition  net of cash acquired  was approximately billion 
during  the acquisitions of rosscor and cot puritech resulted in net cash outflows of million 
during  we had cash outflows of million related to the acquisition of baric 
capital expenditures for of million were significantly higher than million and million used in and  respectively  due to the much larger scale of our operations in cash flows from financing activities in were also significantly impacted by the charter acquisition 
as discussed above under equity capital  we raised million of cash from sales of our equity securities to the bdt investor  steven and mitchell rales and markel in january  and million in a primary offering settled in march also  as further discussed above under borrowing arrangements  we borrowed approximately billion of term loans  million of which was repaid in the additional payment of borrowings under term loans of million primarily represents the repayment of borrowings under our bank of america credit agreement  in conjunction with the financing of the charter acquisition 
we also made cash payments for preferred stock dividends of million 
our cash flows from financing activities during were also impacted by a million acquisition of shares in esab india limited  a publicly traded  less than wholly owned subsidiary in which the company acquired a controlling interest in the charter acquisition 
this acquisition of shares was pursuant to a statutorily mandated tender offer triggered as a result of the charter acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities during included net borrowings of million  which were primarily related to the acquisitions of rosscor and cot puritech 
see borrowing arrangements above for additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our cash and cash equivalents as of december  includes million held in jurisdictions outside the us  which may be subject to tax penalties and other restrictions if repatriated into the us contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of december  less than one year years years more than years total in millions debt  interest payments on debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total  variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand  the timing of which is not certain 
we have cash funding requirements associated with our pension and other post retirement benefit plans as of december   which are estimated to be approximately million for the year ended december  other long term liabilities  such as those for asbestos and other legal claims  employee benefit plan obligations  deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits  are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements other than outstanding letters of credit of million and million of bank guarantees at december  and million of future operating lease payments 
the company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets 
in connection with these divestitures  certain representations  warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities 
we cannot estimate the potential liability  if any  that may result from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies  however  we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
disclosure under section r d iii of the exchange act during the fiscal year  a few of our independently operated foreign subsidiaries which we acquired in made the final shipments necessary to wind down four sales agreements involving parties identified in section of title of the code of federal regulations 
these foreign subsidiaries entered into the original sales agreements in the years before we acquired them 
the shipments were made as part of our foreign subsidiaries voluntary withdrawal from the iranian market  which was implemented as part of the foreign subsidiaries integration into our comprehensive international trade compliance program  which prohibits sales to iran 
the transactions were conducted in accordance with economic sanctions statutes and regulations administered by the us department of the treasury s office of foreign assets controls  other us statutes restricting trade with iran  and with applicable local laws in europe 
as part of our effort to ensure our compliance with us sanctions  the company consulted with us government personnel who administer certain iranian sanctions prior to some of the shipments 
the transactions did not involve us origin content and us persons did not control  approve  facilitate or otherwise participate in the transactions 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries requested and obtained the required authorizations under local export control laws in europe to complete the transactions 
the gross revenue for each shipment was    and  with profit margins of and on the first two shipments and losses on the remaining two shipments 
colfax is committed to continuing to comply fully with all us economic sanctions 
as part of that commitment  all of the company s foreign subsidiaries have voluntarily withdrawn from selling into the iranian market 
as a result  neither colfax nor any of its foreign subsidiaries intend to conduct any future shipments to iran 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
asbestos liabilities and insurance assets certain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos 
such components were acquired from third party suppliers  and were not manufactured by any of the company s subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos 
the manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries customers  including the us navy 
we have projected each subsidiary s future asbestos related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the nicholson methodology 
the nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts 
this methodology is based upon risk equations  exposed population estimates  mortality rates  and other demographic statistics 
in applying the nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos  a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos related diseases in each year  an analysis of the subsidiaries recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values  which vary by disease type  jurisdiction and the nature of claim  to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims 
our projections  based upon the nicholson methodology  estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item above 
it is our policy to record a liability for asbestos related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate 
accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next years 
projecting future asbestos related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict  including  among others  the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in the claims  funds available in post bankruptcy trusts  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
these trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability  and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods 
accordingly  we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assesses whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate 
taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate 
while it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period  we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time 
accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next years 
defense costs associated with asbestos related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries insurers are expensed as incurred 
we assessed the subsidiaries existing insurance arrangements and agreements  estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims  analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness and solvency of the various insurers  and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities 
the analysis took into account self insurance retentions  policy exclusions  pending litigation  liability caps and gaps in coverage  existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies 
each subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity 
in our evaluation of the insurance asset  we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary 
management s analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions 
however  projecting future events  such as new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of resolving each claim  coverage issues among layers of insurers  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  the amount of remaining insurance available  as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
as of december   we had total asbestos liabilities  including current portion  of million and total asbestos insurance assets  including current portion  of million 
see note  commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets 
retirement benefits pension obligations and other post retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions  including the discount rate  assumed annual rates of return on plan assets  and per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post retirement expense recognized in future periods 
these assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions 
see note  defined benefit plans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value 
if we determine that it is not likely for a reporting unit s fair value to be less than its carrying value  a calculation of the fair value is not performed 
if we determine that it is likely for a reporting unit s fair value to be less than its carrying value  a calculation of the reporting entity s fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the impairment analysis is performed 
in step two of the analysis  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
we measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows or a market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future 
significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include the weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of our business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company against certain market information 
significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 
the analyses performed as of september   october  and october  indicated no impairment to be present 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and projections  which would affect the assessment of impairment 
as of december   we have goodwill of billion that is subject to at least annual review of impairment 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
during  the valuation allowance increased from million to million 
the acquired charter businesses operate in certain territories which have not historically been profitable or profitability is not expected in the near term 
as such  valuation allowances were established in the initial accounts where realization of deferred tax assets was not more likely than not 
for colfax  certain deferred tax assets existing at the date were reassessed in light of the impact of the acquired businesses on expected future income or loss by country and future tax planning  including the impact of the post acquisition capital structure 
this assessment resulted in a million increase in the company s valuation allowance to provide full valuation allowance against us deferred tax assets 
in  additional losses were recorded in territories  including the us  where full valuation allowances were established at the time of the charter acquisition 
the more likely than not realization standard was applied to these additional deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance was provided 
accounting standards codification  income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return 
under this standard  we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits 
an income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that effect our estimates  such as the availability of new information  the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  the conclusion of tax audits and  if applicable  the conclusion of any court proceedings 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits  including accrued interest and penalties were million as of december  and are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and costs from product sales under the completed contract method when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  there are no further obligations to customers  and collectibility is probable 
product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
our shipping terms vary based on the contract 
if any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment  typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer  revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled 
any customer allowances and discounts are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the sales price for the products sold 
these allowances and discounts are estimated based on historical experience and known trends 
revenue related to service agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
we recognize revenue and cost of sales on gas handling construction projects using the percentage of completion method in accordance with us gaap 
under this method  contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract 
any recognized revenues that have not been billed to a customer are recorded as a component of trade receivables and any billings of customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of accounts payable 
as of december   there were million of revenues in excess of billings and million of billings in excess of revenues on construction contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have contracts in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates  including estimated costs to complete projects  must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period 
current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
the revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in short term interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to exposure from changes in short term interest rates related to interest payments on our borrowing arrangements 
under the deutsche bank credit agreement  all of our borrowings as of december  are variable rate facilities based on libor or euribor 
in order to mitigate our interest rate risk  we periodically enter into interest rate swap or collar agreements 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate of would have increased interest expense by approximately million during exchange rate risk we have manufacturing sites throughout the world and sell our products globally 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we manufacture and sell products and services 
during  approximately of our sales were derived from operations outside the us we have significant manufacturing operations in european countries that are not part of the eurozone 
sales revenues are more highly weighted toward the euro and us dollar 
we also have significant contractual obligations  as discussed above  in us dollars that are met with cash flows in other currencies as well as us dollars 
to better match revenue and expense as well as cash needs from contractual liabilities  we regularly enter into cross currency swaps and forward contracts 
we also face exchange rate risk from our investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 
the million term a facility under the deutsche bank credit agreement the term loan a  discussed above  provides a natural hedge to a portion of our european net asset position 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries  net of the translation effect of the company s term loan a  is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity 
a depreciation in major currencies  relative to the us dollar as of december  net of the translation effect of our term loan a would result in a reduction in equity of approximately million 
we also face exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the us and from intercompany transactions between affiliates 
although we use the u 
s dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes  we have manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies 
costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar 
in particular  the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies 
although a significant portion of this difference is hedged  when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  operating profits are increased or decreased  respectively 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials used in our production processes 
commodity futures contracts are periodically used to manage such exposure 
as of december   we had no open commodity futures contracts 
see note  financial instruments and fair value measurements in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information regarding our derivative instruments
