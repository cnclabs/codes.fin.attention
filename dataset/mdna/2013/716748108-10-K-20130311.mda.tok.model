item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the state of delaware with operations in oklahoma  texas  the gulf coast basin and wyoming 
we seek to grow our production  proved reserves  cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration  development and acquisition activities 
from the commencement of our operations in through  we were focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
we have successfully diversified into onshore  longer life basins in oklahoma  wyoming and texas through a combination of selective acquisitions and drilling activity 
beginning in with our acquisition of the carthage field in texas through  we have invested approximately million into growing our longer life assets 
during the nine year period ended december   we have realized a drilling success rate on gross wells drilled 
comparing metrics with those in  the year we implemented our diversification strategy  we have grown production by and estimated proved reserves by 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves and of our production were derived from our longer life assets 
gas prices have remained weak since late as a result of the impact of low natural gas prices on our revenues and cash flow  we have focused on growing our reserves and production through a balanced drilling budget with an increased emphasis on growing our oil and natural gas liquids production 
in may  we entered into the woodford joint development agreement jda  which provided us with million in cash during and  along with a drilling carry that we have utilized since may to enhance economic returns by reducing our share of capital expenditures in the woodford and mississippian lime 

table of contents as a result of the jda and the success of our drilling programs  we have grown our estimated proved reserves by and production by since  while maintaining our long term debt below levels 
during february  we amended our jda to accelerate the entry into phase of the drilling program effective march  and modify the drilling carry ratio 
under the amended jda  the phase drilling carry was expanded to provide for development in both the mississippian lime and woodford shale plays whereby we will pay of the cost to drill and complete wells and receive a ownership interest 
the phase drilling carry is subject to extensions in one year intervals and as of december   approximately million remained available

critical accounting policies reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
disclosure requirements under staff accounting bulletin sab include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
the rules also allow companies the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the existing requirement to disclose proved reserves 
the disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates 
pricing is based on a month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the month period prior to the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  the month average is also used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion 
table of contents expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges in place  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
at december   the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves  including the effect of hedges in place at that date  averaged per mcf of natural gas  per barrel of oil  and per mcfe of ngl 
as a result of lower natural gas prices and their negative impact on certain of our longer lived estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows  we recognized ceiling test write downs of million and million during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
our cash flow hedges in place decreased the ceiling test write downs by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that further write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
derivative instruments we seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of our production through commodity derivative instruments 
the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices for oil and natural gas 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments  with the exception of a three way collar contract for natural gas production  were designated effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future nymex prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third party s valuation model that utilizes market corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract 
our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the periods noted

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary fluctuations were as follows production total production increased during the year ended december  as compared to the period 
gas production during the year ended december  increased from the period 
the increase in gas production was primarily the result of the success of our drilling programs in the woodford shale in oklahoma  the carthage field in east texas  and the la cantera field in south louisiana 
gas production also increased at our west cameron block well due to a successful recompletion during the fourth quarter of partially offsetting these increases were normal production declines particularly in our gulf coast region 
as a result of our reduced capital expenditures budget in  we expect our average daily gas production in to remain stable as compared to oil production during the year ended december  decreased as compared to the period due primarily to continued normal production declines in our onshore louisiana and offshore gulf of mexico fields 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases from the inception of production from our la cantera field during march  our eagle ford shale field where five new wells commenced production during the third and fourth quarters of and at our mississippian lime field where initial oil production from our first wells began during the second quarter of with four additional wells beginning production during the fourth quarter 
additionally  oil production increased at our ship shoal field as a result of three successful recompletions performed during the fourth quarter of as a result of decreased drilling planned for  we expect our average daily oil production to decrease as compared to ngl production during the year ended december  increased from the period due to the inception of production from our la cantera field  the liquids rich portion of our oklahoma properties  and an increase in production at our carthage field in east texas 
these increases were partially offset by the normal production declines particularly in our gulf coast region 
as a result of our drilling success in texas  oklahoma and the gulf coast region  as well as the large allocation of drilling capital in to the woodford shale in oklahoma  we expect our daily ngl production in to increase as compared to prices including the effects of our hedges  average gas prices per mcf for the year ended december  were as compared to for the period 
average oil prices per bbl for the year ended december  were as compared to for the period and average ngl prices per mcfe were for the year ended december   as compared 
table of contents to for the period 
stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during the year ended december  were lower than the prices received during the period 
revenue including the effects of hedges  oil and gas sales during the twelve months ended december  decreased to  as compared to oil and gas sales of  during the period 
the decreased revenue during was primarily the result of lower natural gas and ngl prices as well as reduced oil production during the period 
expenses lease operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
per unit lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to during the period 
per unit lease operating expenses decreased primarily due to the increase in overall produced volumes during the period 
production taxes for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
the significant decrease during the period was the result of recording a receivable of  during june for refunds relative to severance tax previously paid on our oklahoma horizontal wells that we expect to receive over the next three years 
beginning in july  we are no longer required to submit the full rate of oklahoma severance tax on those wells qualifying for the horizontal tax credit 
as a result of the refund receivable recorded in  we expect production taxes to be higher than  and may approximate the taxes incurred in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
included in general and administrative expenses was non cash share based compensation expense as follows in thousands year ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period of primarily due to increased non cash share based compensation expense during we capitalized  of general and administrative costs during the year ended december  as compared to  during the comparable period 
general and administrative expenses in are expected to approximate results 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for the year ended december  totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe  during the comparable period 
the decrease in the per unit dd a rate is primarily the result of a decrease in the depletable base due to the ceiling test write downs recognized during at december   the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves  including the effect of hedges in place at that date  averaged per mcf of natural gas  per barrel of oil  and per mcfe of ngl 
as a result of lower natural gas prices and their negative impact on certain of our longer lived estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows  we recognized ceiling test write downs of  during the year ended december  we also recognized a ceiling test write down of  during the twelve months ended december  interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during the year ended december   as compared to  during during the year ended december   our capitalized interest totaled  as compared to  during the period 
income tax expense benefit during the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
we typically provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs recognized  we have incurred a cumulative three year loss 
because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was  as of december  
table of contents comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the fluctuations were as follows production total production decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the period 
however  total production in the fourth quarter of increased as compared to the third quarter of gas production during the year ended december  decreased less than one percent from the comparable period in the decrease in gas production was primarily the result of normal production declines in the gulf coast basin  offset by increases in gas production from our longer life basins 
oil production during the twelve month period ended december  decreased from the comparable period 
the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of normal production declines in the gulf coast basin 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases due to the inception of production in the niobrara shale  where our first well began production in the fourth quarter of and three subsequent wells began production during  and in the eagle ford shale  where our first five wells began production in the third quarter of these niobrara and eagle ford shale wells represented of our total oil production during ngl production during the twelve months ended december  decreased from the comparable period due to the general decline in gulf coast gas production 
prices including the effects of our hedges  average gas prices per mcf for the twelve months ended december  were as compared to for the period 
average oil prices per bbl for the twelve months ended december  were as compared to for the period 
average ngl prices per mcfe for the twelve months ended december  were compared to during the period 
stated on an mcfe basis  unit prices received during the twelve month period ended december  were lower than the prices received during the comparable period 
revenue including the effects of hedges  oil and gas sales during the twelve months ended december  decreased to  as compared to oil and gas sales of  during the period 
the decreased revenue during was primarily the result of lower gas prices and decreased oil production partially offset by higher oil prices 
expenses lease operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  decreased to  as compared to  during the period 
per unit lease operating expenses totaled per mcfe during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to per mcfe during the period 
production taxes decreased during the twelve months ended december  to  from  during the comparable period 
the decrease was primarily the result of refunds received totaling  during with respect to severance tax previously paid on oklahoma and east texas wells as compared to  received during general and administrative expenses during the twelve months ended december  totaled  as compared to expenses of  during the period 
included in general and administrative expenses was share based compensation expense related to asc topic  as follows in thousands years ended december  stock options incentive stock options non qualified stock options restricted stock share based compensation we capitalized  of general and administrative costs during the twelve month period ended december  and  of such costs during the comparable period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  totaled  or per mcfe  as compared to  or per mcfe  during the comparable period 
as a result of higher estimated future development costs and low natural gas prices and their negative impact on certain of our longer lived estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows  we recorded non cash ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties of  during the year ended december  there were no ceiling test write downs of our oil and gas properties in the period 
see note  ceiling test for further discussion of the ceiling test write downs 

table of contents interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties  totaled  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to  during the period 
we capitalized  of interest during the twelve month period of  and  during the respective period 
the decrease in capitalized interest during the year ended december  was due to the sale of a portion of our unevaluated properties pursuant to the woodford joint development agreement during the second quarter of total interest costs were lower during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as a result of the refinancing of our senior notes due with our senior notes due in august in january  we recorded a gain relative to a  cash settlement received from a lawsuit filed by us in relating to disputed interests in certain oil and gas assets purchased in in addition to the cash proceeds received  we were assigned additional working interests in certain producing properties 
we recorded an additional  gain representing the estimated fair market value of those interests on the effective date of the settlement 
as a result of the early redemption of our senior notes due  we incurred a loss during totaling  approximately  of the loss related to non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and discount associated with the senior notes due income tax expense benefit during the twelve months ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs recognized during prior years  we incurred a cumulative three year loss 
because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax asset in prior periods 
during  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance as future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities were sufficient to realize the entire deferred tax asset and we had a net deferred tax liability of  at december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  second lien term credit facilities  issuances of equity and debt securities  joint ventures and sales of assets 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a deficit of million at december  the increase in our working capital deficit is primarily the result of our increased operational activities as our capital expenditures during exceeded our cash flow from operations 
since we operate the majority of our drilling activities  we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures to manage our working capital deficit and liquidity position 
to the extent our capital expenditures in exceed our cash flow and cash on hand  we plan to utilize available borrowings under the bank credit facility or proceeds from the potential sale of non core assets to fund a portion of our drilling budget 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to many factors beyond our control such as weather  the overall condition of the global financial markets and economies  relatively minor changes in the outlook of supply and demand  and the actions of opec 
oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
lower prices and reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  including under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
see source of capital debt below 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as oil and natural gas prices 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations decreased from million during the twelve months ended december  to million during the period 
the decrease in operating cash flow during as compared to was primarily attributable to the decrease in oil and gas revenues during the period due to lower natural gas prices and lower oil production 
source of capital debt on august   we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the notes in a public offering 
at december   the estimated fair value of the notes was million  based upon a market quote provided by an independent broker 
the notes have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset 
table of contents sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september at december   million had been accrued in connection with the march  interest payment and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the notes 
we have a credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  wells fargo bank  na  capital one  na  iberiabank and whitney bank 
the credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the commitments of the lenders and the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on october  as of december  we had million of borrowings outstanding under and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas properties as of january and july of each year 
the current borrowing base is million subject to the aggregate commitments of the lenders then in effect 
the aggregate commitments of the lenders is currently million and can be increased to up to million by either adding new lenders or increasing the commitments of existing lenders  subject to certain conditions 
the next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to occur by march  we or the lenders may request two additional borrowing base redeterminations each year 
each time the borrowing base is to be re determined  the administrative agent under the credit agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion  which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is to be increased  or by lenders holding two thirds of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including a lien on all equipment and at least of the aggregate total value of our oil and gas properties 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate abr plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments or the adjusted libo rate eurodollar plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments 
the alternate base rate is equal to the highest of i the jpmorgan chase prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii the adjusted libo rate plus 
for the purposes of the definition of alternative base rate only  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which dollar deposits of  with a one month maturity are offered by the principal london office of jpmorgan chase bank  na in immediately available funds in the london interbank market 
for all other purposes  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market for one  two  three or six months as selected by us are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities 
outstanding letters of credit are charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to eurodollar loans  a fronting fee and customary administrative fees 
in addition  we pay commitment fees based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit agreement  including a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt  liens  dividends  distributions and redemptions  investments  loans and advances  nature of business  international operations and foreign subsidiaries  leases  sale or discount of receivables  mergers or consolidations  sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  negative pledge agreements  gas imbalances and swap agreements 
however  the credit agreement permits us to repurchase up to million of our common stock during the term of the credit agreement  so long as after giving effect to such repurchase our liquidity as defined therein is greater than of the total commitments of the lenders at such time 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement 
source of capital issuance of securities during october  our shelf registration statement was declared effective  which allows us to publicly offer and sell up to million of any combination of debt securities  shares of common and preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital joint ventures in may  we entered into a joint development agreement with wsgp gas producing  llc wsgp  a subsidiary of nextera energy resources  llc  whereby wsgp acquired approximately bcfe of our woodford proved undeveloped reserves as well as the right to earn of our undeveloped woodford acreage position through a two phase drilling program 
we received approximately million in cash at closing  net of million in transaction fees  and an additional million on november  in addition  since may  wsgp has funded a share of our drilling costs under a drilling program 
we achieved certain production performance metrics  as outlined in the joint development agreement  relative to the first wells drilled under the drilling program 
as a result  we received an additional million during december 
table of contents during february  we amended the joint development agreement with wsgp to provide additional funding for a share of our drilling costs relative to our drilling programs in both our woodford shale and mississippian lime project areas 
wsgp will continue to earn of our undeveloped woodford shale acreage as they continue to fund a share of our drilling costs 
as of december   approximately million of drilling carry remained available 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continuously evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects 
we are currently exploring divestment opportunities for our wyoming and south texas assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future 
on december   we sold our non operated arkansas assets for a net cash purchase price of million 
in january  we sold of our saltwater disposal systems and related surface assets in the woodford for net proceeds of approximately million 
use of capital exploration and development our capital budget  which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
because we operate most of our activities  we expect to be able to manage the timing of our capital expenditures in the event commodity prices or costs do not meet our expectations 
we plan to fund our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
to the extent our capital expenditures during exceed these sources  we plan to utilize available borrowings under the bank credit facility or proceeds from the potential sale of non core assets 
to the extent additional capital is required  we may utilize sales of equity or debt securities or we may reduce our capital expenditures to manage our liquidity position 
use of capital acquisitions we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our existing asset base or establish positions in new core areas 
we expect to finance our future acquisition activities  if consummated  through cash on hand or available borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we may also utilize sales of equity or debt securities  sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners  if necessary 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total after senior notes bank debt operating leases asset retirement obligations purchase commitments total includes principal and estimated interest 
consists primarily of leases for office space and office equipment 
consists of estimated future obligations to abandon our oil and gas properties 
consists of certain drilling rig contracts 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 

table of contents our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we expect to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received approximately million from the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
our credit agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under the credit agreement or  if not a lender under the credit agreement  rated a a or higher by s p or moody s 
currently  the counterparties to our existing hedge contracts are jpmorgan chase bank and wells fargo bank  both of whom are lenders under the credit agreement 
to the extent we enter into additional hedge contracts  we would expect that certain of the lenders under the credit agreement would serve as counterparties 
as of december   we had entered into the following gas hedge contracts production period instrument type daily volumes weighted average price natural gas way collar  mmbtu swap  mmbtu at december   we recognized a net asset of approximately million related to the estimated fair value of these derivative instruments
