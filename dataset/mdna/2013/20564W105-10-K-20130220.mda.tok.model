table of contents during the second quarter of  we noted a significant decline in revenues from arsgroup  or ars  which we acquired in february as a result  we performed an impairment test of the long lived assets of ars and ultimately recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  as a result of the significant decline in revenue from ars and the resulting impairment charge of million  we began exploring all strategic options with respect to maximizing the value of ars  including a potential sale of some or all of ars 
currently  we expect to dispose of the non health portions of ars 
we do not expect this transaction to have a material impact on our financial statements 
our company was founded in august in  we completed our initial public offering 
we have complemented our internal development initiatives with targeted acquisitions 
in february  we acquired the outstanding stock of arsgroup  inc to expand our ability to provide our customers with actionable information to improve their creative and strategic messaging targeted against specific audiences 
in july  we acquired the outstanding stock of nexius  inc  a provider of products to the large mobile networks that deliver network analysis focused on the experience of wireless subscribers  as well as network intelligence with respect to performance  capacity and configuration analytics 
in august  we acquired the outstanding stock of nedstat bv  a provider of web analytics and innovative video measurement products based out of amsterdam  netherlands 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding equity of adxpose  inc  a provider of digital advertising analytics products based out of seattle  washington 
since our initial public offering in  our revenues and expenses have grown significantly 
we attribute the growth in our revenue and expenses primarily to increased sales to existing customers  as a result of our efforts to deepen our relationships with these customers by increasing their awareness of  and confidence in  the value of our digital marketing intelligence platform  growth in our customer base through the addition of new customers and from acquired businesses  the sales of new products to existing and new customers  and growth in sales outside of the us  as a result of entering into new international markets 
as a result of economic events such as the global financial crisis in the credit markets  softness in the housing markets  difficulties in the financial services sector  political uncertainty in the middle east  and concerns regarding the eurozone  the direction and relative strength of the us and global economies have become somewhat uncertain in recent periods 
during and  we experienced a limited number of our current and potential customers ceasing  delaying or reducing renewals of existing subscriptions and purchases of new or additional services and products presumably due to the economic downturn 
further  certain of our existing customers exited the market due to industry consolidation and bankruptcy in connection with these challenging economic conditions 
since these negative economic events began in  we continued to annually add net new customers and our existing customers renewed their subscriptions at a rate of over based on dollars renewed each year 
notwithstanding our performance during these macroeconomic trends  if economic recovery slows or economic conditions deteriorate  our operating results could be adversely affected in coming periods 
our revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the fees that we charge for subscription based products  customized projects  and software licenses 
we define subscription based revenues as revenues that we generate from products that we deliver to a customer on a recurring basis  as well as arrangements where a customer is committing up front to purchase a series of deliverables over time  which includes revenue from software licenses as further discussed below 
we define project revenues as revenues that we generate from customized projects that are performed for a specific customer on a non recurring basis 
a significant characteristic of our saas based business model is our large percentage of subscription based contracts 
subscription based revenues accounted for of total revenues in each of the years ended december  and many of our customers who initially purchased a customized project have subsequently purchased one of our subscription based products 
similarly  many of our subscription based customers have subsequently purchased additional customized projects 
historically  we have generated most of our revenues from the sale and delivery of our products to companies and organizations located within the united states 
we intend to expand our international revenues by selling our products and deploying our direct sales force model in additional international markets in the future 
for the year ended december   our international revenues were million  an increase of million  or over international revenues of million for the year ended december  international revenues comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that revenues from our us customers will continue to constitute a substantial portion of our revenues in coming periods  but we expect that revenues from customers outside of the us will increase as a percentage of total revenues as we build greater international recognition of our brand and expand our sales operations globally 

table of contents subscription revenues we generate a significant portion of our subscription based revenues from our media metrix product suite 
products within the media metrix suite include media metrix  media metrix  plan metrix  world metrix  video metrix and ad metrix 
these product offerings provide subscribers with intelligence on digital media usage  audience characteristics  audience demographics and online and offline purchasing behavior 
customers who subscribe to our media metrix products are provided with login ids to our web site  have access to our database and can generate reports at anytime 
we also generate subscription based revenues from certain reports and analyses provided through our customer research product  if that work is procured by customers on a recurring basis 
through our customer research products  we deliver digital marketing intelligence relating to specific industries  such as automotive  consumer packaged goods  entertainment  financial services  media  pharmaceutical  retail  technology  telecommunications and travel 
this marketing intelligence leverages our global consumer panel and extensive database to deliver information unique to a particular customer s needs on a recurring schedule  as well as on a continual access basis 
our marketing solutions customer agreements typically include a fixed fee with an initial term of at least one year 
we also provide these products on a non subscription basis as described under project revenues below 
in addition  we generate subscription based revenues from survey products that we sell to our customers 
in conducting our surveys  we generally use our global internet user panel 
after questionnaires are distributed to the panel members and completed  we compile their responses and then deliver our findings to the customer  who also has ongoing access to the survey response data as they are compiled and updated over time 
these data include responses and information collected from the actual survey questionnaires and can also include behavioral information that we passively collect from our panelists 
if a customer has a history of purchasing survey products in each of the last four quarters  then we believe this indicates the surveys are being conducted on a recurring basis  and we classify the revenues generated from such survey products as subscription based revenues 
our contracts for survey services typically include a fixed fee with terms that range from two months to one year 
our acquisition of nedstat  resulted in additional revenue sources  including software subscriptions  server calls  and professional services including training and consulting 
our arrangements generally contain multiple elements  consisting of the various service offerings 
our acquisition of adxpose  resulted in additional revenue sources  including fees for the use of the adxpose platform 
fees for the use of the adxpose platform are generally a fixed fee for each impression that is generated using the adxpose technology 
revenue is recognized on a usage basis when the impression is delivered and reported via the adxpose service portal 
project revenues we generate project revenues by providing customized information reports to our customers on a nonrecurring basis through comscore marketing solutions 
for example  a customer in the media industry might request a custom report that profiles the behavior of the customer s active online users and contrasts their market share and loyalty with similar metrics for a competitor s online user base 
if this customer continues to request the report beyond an initial project term of at least nine months and enters into an agreement to purchase the report on a recurring basis  we begin to classify these future revenues as subscription based 
software licenses we generate subscription revenue through software licenses  professional services including software customization  implementation  training and consulting services  and maintenance and technical support contracts 
we recognize software license arrangements that include significant modification and customization of the software in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc  software recognition  and asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts  typically using the completed contract method 
prior to march   we had not established vsoe of fair value for the multiple deliverables and therefore accounted for all elements in these arrangements as a single unit of accounting  recognizing the entire arrangement fee as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the last delivered element 
during the period of performance  billings and costs to the extent they are recoverable are accumulated on the balance sheet  but no profit or income is recorded before user acceptance of the software license 
to the extent estimated costs are expected to exceed revenue  we accrue for costs immediately 
during the quarter ended june  we established vsoe of fair value for post contract support pcs services for certain customers 
the establishment of vsoe of fair value followed an alignment of our pricing practices for these services 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generate revenues by providing access to our online database or delivering information obtained from our database  usually in the form of periodic reports 
revenues are typically recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which access to data or reports is provided  which generally ranges from three to twenty four months 
sales taxes remitted to government authorities are recorded on a net basis 
we also generate revenues through survey services under contracts ranging in term from two months to one year 
our survey services consist of survey and questionnaire design with subsequent data collection  analysis and reporting 
at the outset of an arrangement  we allocate total arrangement consideration between the development of the survey questionnaire and subsequent data collection  analysis and reporting services based on relative selling price 
we recognize revenue allocated to the survey questionnaire when it is delivered and we recognize revenue allocated to the data collection  analysis and reporting services on a straight line basis over the estimated data collection period once the survey or questionnaire design has been delivered 
any change in the estimated data collection period results in an adjustment to revenues recognized in future periods 
certain of our arrangements contain multiple elements  consisting of the various services we offer 
multiple element arrangements typically consist of either subscriptions to multiple online product solutions or a subscription to our online database combined with customized services 
prior to january   we had determined there was not objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any of our services and  therefore  accounted for all elements in multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting 
access to data under the subscription element is generally provided shortly after the execution of the contract 
however  the initial delivery of customized services generally occurs subsequent to the commencement of the subscription element 
for these historical arrangements  we recognized the entire arrangement fee over the performance period of the last deliverable 
as a result  the total arrangement fee is recognized on a straight line basis over the period beginning with the commencement of the last element deliverable 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which requires us to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables  if they represent a separate unit of accounting  based on their relative selling prices 
in addition  this guidance eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement consideration 
this guidance is applicable to us for all arrangements entered into subsequent to december  and for any existing arrangements that are materially modified after december  for these types of arrangements  the guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating arrangement consideration to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe is not available  or iii an estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable on a stand alone basis 
esp reflects our estimate of what the selling price of a deliverable would be if it was sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we have concluded that we do not have vsoe  for these types of arrangements  and tpe is generally not available because our service offerings are highly differentiated and we are unable to obtain reliable information on the products and pricing practices of our competitors 
as such  esp is used to allocate the total arrangement consideration at the arrangement inception based on each element s relative selling price 
our process for determining esp involves management s judgments based on multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each product suite and deliverable 
we determine esp by considering 
table of contents several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  current pricing practices  pricing concentrations such as industry  channel  customer class or geography  internal costs and market penetration of a product or service 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each of the elements based on the relative selling price 
if the esp is determined as a range of selling prices  the mid point of the range is used in the relative selling price method 
once the total arrangement consideration has been allocated to each deliverable based on the relative allocation of the arrangement fee  we commence revenue recognition for each deliverable on a stand alone basis as the data or service is delivered 
in the future  as our pricing strategies and market conditions change  modifications may occur in the determination of esp to reflect these changes 
as a result  the future revenue recognized for these arrangements could differ from the results in the current period 
generally  our contracts are non refundable and non cancelable 
in the event a portion of a contract is refundable  revenue recognition is delayed until the refund provisions lapse 
a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing us with written notice of cancellation 
in the event that a customer cancels its contract  it is not entitled to a refund for prior services  and it will be charged for costs incurred plus services performed up to the cancellation date 
in connection with our acquisition of nexius  inc  we acquired additional revenue sources  including software licenses  professional services including software customization implementation  training and consulting services  and maintenance and technical support contracts 
our arrangements generally contain multiple elements  consisting of the various service offerings 
we recognize software license arrangements that include significant modification and customization of the software in accordance with asc  software recognition and asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts  typically using the completed contract method 
during the quarter ended june   we established vsoe of fair value for post contract support services for a group of certain nexius customers 
for these specific arrangements  we allocate the total consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on vsoe of fair value and recognize revenue when the fundamental revenue recognition criteria above are met 
for the remainder of the nexius customers  we currently do not have vsoe for the multiple deliverables and account for all elements in these arrangements as a single unit of accounting  recognizing the entire arrangement fee as revenue over the service period of the last delivered element 
during the period of performance  billings and costs to the extent they are recoverable are accumulated on the balance sheet  but no profit or income is recorded before user acceptance of the software license 
to the extent estimated costs are expected to exceed revenue we accrue for costs immediately 
we account for nonmonetary transactions under asc  nonmonetary transactions 
nonmonetary transactions with commercial substance are recorded at the estimated fair value of assets surrendered including cash  if cash is less than of the fair value of the overall exchange  unless the fair value of the assets received is more clearly evident  in which case the fair value of the asset received is used 
during the year ended december  we recognized million in revenue related to nonmonetary transactions 
due to timing differences in the delivery and receipt of the respective nonmonetary assets exchanged  the expense recognized in each period is different from the amount of revenue recognized 
as a result  during the year ended december   we recognized million in expense related to nonmonetary transactions 
business combinations we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
generally  restructuring costs incurred in periods subsequent to the acquisition date are expensed when incurred 
all subsequent changes to an income tax valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in income tax valuation allowances are recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other businesses 
the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
we estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired using several different valuation approaches  including relief from royalty method  and income and market approaches 
the relief from royalty method assumes that if we did not own the intangible asset or intellectual property  we would be willing to pay a royalty for its use 
we generally use the relief from royalty method for estimating the value of acquired technology methodology assets 
the income approach converts the anticipated economic benefits that we assume will be realized from a given asset into value 
under this approach  value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by an asset 
we generally use the income approach to value customer relationship assets and non compete 
table of contents agreements 
the market approach compares the acquired asset to similar assets that have been sold 
we generally use the income approach to value trademarks and brand assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but rather are periodically tested for impairment 
an impairment review generally requires developing assumptions and projections regarding our operating performance 
we have determined that all of our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit as we do not operate separate lines of business with respect to our services 
accordingly  on an annual basis we perform the impairment assessment for goodwill at the enterprise level by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill recorded by the reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets  which could be material 
there were no impairment charges to goodwill recognized during the years ended december   or during the three months ended june   we noted a significant decline in revenues from ars  which we acquired in february as a result  we performed an impairment test of the long lived assets of ars 
the long lived assets of ars consist of customer relationships and acquired methodologies and technology 
the first step in testing the long lived assets of ars for impairment was to compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of ars to the carrying value of ars s long lived assets 
based on this analysis  we determined as of june  that the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated from ars was less than the carrying value of the ars intangible assets 
as such  we concluded that the ars intangible assets were impaired as of june  to measure the amount of the impairment  we then estimated the fair value of the intangible assets as of june  in determining the fair value of the intangible assets  we prepared a discounted cash flow dcf analysis for each intangible asset 
in preparing the dcf analysis  we used a combination of income approaches including the relief from royalty approach and the excess earnings approach 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  terminal growth rates  royalty rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis were based on our most recent budgets  forecasts and business plans as well as growth rate assumptions for years beyond the current business plan period 
significant assumptions used include a discount rate of  which is based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future revenue streams and cash flows of ars  as well as a royalty rate of  which is based on an analysis of royalty rates in similar  market transactions 
based on the dcf analysis  we estimated the fair value of the intangible assets of ars to be million as of june   which resulted in an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  the impairment charge had a negative impact on net loss of million and an impact on earnings per share of per share during the year ended december  in addition  these intangible assets will be amortized over a remaining estimated useful life of eighteen months  beginning july  there were no impairment charges to intangible assets recognized during the years ended or long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset group s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
other than the impairment charge for ars discussed above  there were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended december   or allowance for doubtful accounts we manage credit risk on accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations of our customers for existing customers coming up for renewal as well as all prospective new customers  by reviewing our accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts 
allowances are based on management s judgment  which considers historical experience and specific knowledge of accounts that may not be collectible 
we make provisions based on our historical bad debt experience  a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and an assessment of general economic conditions 
if 
table of contents the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  we consider factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in evaluating projections of future taxable income  we consider our history of profitability  the competitive environment  the overall outlook for the online marketing industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  we consider the timeframe over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 
to the extent we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying value of such assets 
as of december  and  we recorded valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
at december   the valuation allowance was related to the deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss carryforwards of the foreign subsidiaries that are either loss companies or are in their start up phases  including entities in mexico  singapore  spain  australia  czech republic  netherlands and china  the deferred tax asset related to the us capital loss carryforwards  and the deferred tax asset related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the valuation allowance was primarily related to the deferred tax assets of the foreign subsidiaries that are in their start up phases  including china  spain  singapore  and certain certifica and nedstat subsidiaries  and the deferred tax asset related to the value of our auction rate securities 
as of december   we concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses would be realized and determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance of million against our state deferred tax assets 
we also concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in certain other foreign jurisdictions  primarily the netherlands  would be realized and that an increase to the valuation allowance of million was necessary 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in these foreign jurisdictions during  the current overall economic environment  and the uncertainty regarding the profitability of certain foreign operations currently in start up phase 
in addition  during  we wrote off certain deferred tax assets related to net operating losses that will never be realized 
as these deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance recorded against them  the associated valuation allowance of million was released 
as a result of the losses incurred in  our us entities are in a three year cumulative pretax loss position at december  a cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which includes deferred tax assets of million related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the us we have concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence 
this positive evidence includes the fact that i our three year cumulative pretax loss position includes million of litigation and settlement charges that are not expected to recur in the future and ii our profitable us operating forecasts  exclusive of tax planning strategies  result in full utilization of our net deferred tax assets by the end of based on the current projections 
however  our ability to realize our net us deferred tax assets of million at december  is primarily dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in future years 
we believe that there is sufficient objective and reliable evidence to support the realization of the recorded us deferred tax assets as of december  based on our current projections of future pre tax income 
if our actual results do not validate our current projections of pre tax income  we may be required to record a valuation allowance that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
as of december   we concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our netherlands deferred tax assets will be realized and determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance of million against our netherlands deferred tax assets 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in the netherlands during and in prior years and the uncertainty regarding the future profitability of the netherlands operations 
we also concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in certain other foreign jurisdictions would be realized and that an increase to the valuation allowance was necessary 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in these foreign jurisdictions during  the current overall economic environment  and the uncertainty regarding the profitability of certain foreign operations 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we recorded an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 

table of contents as of december   we estimate our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal income tax purposes and in for state income tax purposes 
in addition  at december   we estimate our aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries is million  which begins to expire in the exercise of certain stock options and the vesting of certain restricted stock awards during the years ended december  and generated income tax deductions equal to the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price or grant date fair value  as applicable 
we will not recognize a deferred tax asset with respect to the excess of tax over book stock compensation deductions until the tax deductions actually reduce our current taxes payable 
as such  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset in the accompanying financial statements related to the additional net operating losses generated from the windfall tax deductions associated with the exercise of these stock options and the vesting of the restricted stock awards 
if and when we utilize these net operating losses to reduce income taxes payable  the tax benefit will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
as of december  and december   the cumulative amount of net operating losses relating to such option exercises and vesting events that have been included in the gross net operating loss carryforwards above is million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized windfall tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively  related to certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions  which were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
during the years ended december  and  certain stock options were exercised and certain shares related to restricted stock awards vested at times when our stock price was substantially lower than the fair value of those shares at the time of grant 
as a result  the income tax deduction related to such shares is less than the expense previously recognized for book purposes 
such shortfalls reduce additional paid in capital to the extent relevant windfall tax benefits have been previously recognized 
as described above  we recognized a portion of the windfall tax benefits in and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital 
therefore  million of shortfalls has not been included in income tax expense but has reduced additional paid in capital for the year ended december  the remaining impact of the shortfalls totaling million has been included in income tax expense 
as of december   we recognized a portion of the windfall tax benefits and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital 
therefore  the impact of the shortfalls totaling million was not included in income tax expense but reduced additional paid in capital for the year ended december  looking forward we cannot predict the stock compensation shortfall impact because of dependency upon future market price performance of our stock 
for uncertain tax positions  we use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefits determined on a cumulative probability basis  which are more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
as of december   and  we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively  on a tax effected basis 
it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was million 
as of december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was million 
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
for income tax returns filed by us  we are no longer subject to us federal examinations by tax authorities for years before or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before  although tax attribute carryforwards generated prior to these years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of market based stock options and restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation embedded in a lattice model 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock option awards and restricted stock awards is based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the our common stock price  expected stock price volatility over the expected life of awards  and actual and projected exercise behavior 
additionally we estimate forfeitures for share based awards at the dates of grant based on historical experience  adjusted for future expectation 
the forfeiture estimate is revised as necessary if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates 
we issue restricted stock awards whose restrictions lapse upon either the passage of time service vesting  achieving performance targets  or some combination of these restrictions 
for those restricted stock awards with only service conditions  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the explicit service period 
for awards with both performance and service conditions  we start recognizing compensation cost over the remaining service period when it is probable the performance condition will be met 
stock awards that contain performance or market vesting conditions  are excluded from diluted earnings per share computations until the contingency is met as of the end of that reporting period 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense we record may differ significantly from what we have previously recorded 

table of contents at december   total estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock based awards granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the actual amount of stock based compensation expense we record in any fiscal period will depend on a number of factors  including the number of shares subject to restricted stock and or stock options issued  the fair value of our common stock at the time of issuance and the expected volatility of our stock price over time 
in addition  changes to our incentive compensation plan that heavily favor stock based compensation are expected to cause stock based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future period  the compensation expense we record may differ significantly from what we have previously recorded

general and administrative expenses decreased by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees of million associated with patent infringement litigation that occurred in and was settled in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by increased employee salaries  benefits and related costs of million associated with our increased headcount and increased bad debt expense of million associated with the write off of accounts receivable deemed uncollectible and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to our continued international expansion 
in particular  during the year we wrote off approximately million in accounts receivable from two customers located in the middle east 
as a result  we have modified our sales practices in certain countries by going to a reseller type model whereby we contract with one customer in the region as opposed to contracting directly with multiple customers 
in addition  based on our recent historical experience we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due to the overall reduction in costs coupled with the increase in revenues 
amortization expense year ended december  change in thousands amortization expense as a percentage of revenues amortization expense consists of charges related to the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions 
amortization expense remained constant at million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due principally to certain intangible assets whose useful life ended as of december   offset by increased amortization of intangible assets that were acquired as part of the adxpose acquisition in the third quarter of  the acquisition of certain patent intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of  and the shortening of the useful life of the ars intangible assets 
impairment of intangible assets during the three months ended june   we noted a significant decline in revenues from ars  which we acquired in february as a result  we performed an impairment test of the long lived assets of ars 
the long lived assets of ars consist of customer relationships and acquired methodologies and technology 
the first step in testing the long lived assets of ars for impairment was to compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of ars to the carrying value of ars long lived assets 
based on this analysis  we determined as of june  that the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated from ars was less than the carrying value of the ars intangible assets 
as such  we concluded that the intangible assets of ars were impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment  we then estimated the fair value of the ars intangible assets as of june  in determining the fair value of the intangible assets  we prepared a discounted cash flow dcf analysis for each intangible asset 
in preparing the dcf analysis  we used a combination of income approaches  including the relief from royalty approach and the excess earnings approach 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  terminal growth rates  royalty rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the cash flows employed in 
table of contents the dcf analysis are based on our most recent budgets  forecasts and business plans as well as growth rate assumptions for years beyond the current business plan period 
significant assumptions used include a discount rate of  which is based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future revenue streams and cash flows of ars  as well as a royalty rate of  which is based on an analysis of royalty rates in similar  market transactions 
based on the dcf analysis  we have estimated the fair value of the intangible assets of ars to be million as of june   which resulted in an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  in addition  these intangible assets will be amortized over a remaining estimated useful life of eighteen months  beginning july  interest and other income  net interest and other income expense  net  consists of interest income  interest expense and gains or losses on disposals of fixed assets

interest expense is incurred due to capital leases pursuant to several equipment loan and security agreements to finance the lease of various hardware and other equipment purchases and our revolving credit facility 
our capital lease obligations are secured by a senior security interest in eligible equipment 
interest and other income expense  net for the year ended december  resulted in net expense of million as compared to net expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due to our increased use of capital leases to finance the expansion of our technology infrastructure along with fees associated with our revolving credit facility coupled with a reduction in interest income associated with the sale of our auction rate securities in loss from foreign currency the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
all assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates as of the end of the period  and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period
