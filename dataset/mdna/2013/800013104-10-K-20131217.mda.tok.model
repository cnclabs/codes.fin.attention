general the company s poultry operations are integrated through its control of all functions relative to the production of its chicken products  including hatching egg production  hatching  feed manufacturing  raising chickens to marketable age grow out  processing and marketing 
consistent with the poultry industry  the company s profitability is substantially impacted by the market price for its finished products and feed grains  both of which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit cyclical characteristics typically associated with commodity markets 
other costs  excluding feed grains  related to the profitability of the company s poultry operations  including hatching egg production  hatching  growing  and processing cost  are responsive to efficient cost containment programs and management practices 
over the past three fiscal years  these other normal production costs have averaged approximately of the company s total normal production costs 
the company believes that value added products are subject to less price volatility and generate higher  more consistent profit margin than whole chickens ice packed and shipped in bulk form 
to reduce its exposure to market cyclicality that has historically characterized commodity chicken market prices  the company has increasingly concentrated on the production and marketing of value added product lines with emphasis on product quality  customer service  and brand recognition 
however  the company cannot eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in commodity market prices for chicken since market prices for value added products also exhibit cyclicality 
the company adds value to its poultry products by performing one or more processing steps beyond the stage where the whole chicken is first saleable as a finished product  such as cutting  deboning  deep chilling  packaging and labeling the product 
the company s prepared chicken product line includes approximately institutional and consumer packaged chicken items that it sells nationally  primarily to distributors and food service establishments 
a majority of the prepared chicken items are made to the specifications of food service users

the company regularly evaluates both internal and external growth opportunities  including acquisition opportunities and the possible construction of new production assets  and conducts due diligence activities in connection with such opportunities 
the cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any growth opportunity  including the company s ability to raise debt or equity capital on terms and at costs satisfactory to the company  and the effect of such opportunities on the company s balance sheet  are critical considerations in any such evaluation

actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  and the differences could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 
inventories processed and prepared inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
when market prices for poultry are low and feed grains are high  the company may be required to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and live inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s cost of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the cost of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
the company made an adjustment to the value of its live inventories at october  as with processed inventories  the value of live chickens  the costs for which are accumulated during the life of a flock as each flock is fed and cared for  must be recorded on the company s financial statements at the lower of cost or market value 
because of relatively low market prices for poultry during november and december and high feed grains  the projected cost to complete  process and sell broilers included in live inventory at october   was expected to exceed the market value for the finished product 
accordingly  the company s results for the year ended october   include a charge of million before income taxes to reduce the value of live inventories from cost to market 
the company s live broiler inventories are recorded at cost at october  and  because the estimated market value was higher than the estimated cost to complete those live broiler inventories 
breeders are generally not subject to lower of cost or market reserves due to their longer production lives 

table of contents long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
the company accrues expenses in its workers compensation and employee benefit plans for both known claims as well as claims incurred but not reported 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
any resulting adjustments to accrued claims are reflected in current operating results 
there are no material adjustments to expenses accrued in prior periods in current expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 
performance share bonus plans the company enters into performance share agreements that grant certain officers and key employees the right to receive shares of the company s common stock  subject to the company s achievement of certain performance measures 
the performance measures in the outstanding agreements relate to the company s average return on equity and average return on sales over a two year performance period 
the holder has a three year service period as the holder must be employed by the company at the end of the third year to be eligible to receive the shares that met the performance measures 
the company must estimate  at the end of each reporting period  the probability that all or some portion of the shares will be earned at the end of the three year service period 
in making this estimate  the company considers  among other factors  the current and projected grain costs and chicken volumes and pricing  as well as the amount of commitments to procure grain at a fixed price throughout the performance period 
due to the high level of volatility of these commodity prices and the impact that the change in pricing can have on the company s results  the company s assessment of probability can change from period to period and can result in a significant revision to the amounts accrued related to the arrangements 
the accounting for these arrangements requires the company to accrue over the three year service period the estimated amounts of the shares that will be earned with changes made during the service period adjusted using the cumulative catch up method 
the company has accrued million related to open agreements as of october   with an additional amount of million that could be accrued if the company determined that it was probable that the maximum amount of the outstanding awards that could be earned would be earned at the end of the requisite service period 
because of the volatility of the factors previously discussed  the company was unable to determine that it was probable that outstanding awards would be earned as of october  
table of contents income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method and relate principally to depreciation expense  stock based compensation programs and self insurance programs accounted for differently for financial and income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
contingencies the company recognizes the costs of legal defense for the legal proceedings to which it is a party in the periods incurred 
after a considerable analysis of each case  the company determines the amount of reserves required  if any 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
future reserves may be required if losses are deemed reasonably estimable and probable due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations of these legal proceedings 
new accounting pronouncements in may  fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company commits to purchase feed ingredients for deferred delivery from one month to six months after the time of the commitment 
the company sometimes purchases its feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the business of regularly supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 
such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders 
market factors considered by management in determining whether or not and to what extent to buy grain for deferred delivery include current market prices  
table of contents current and predicted weather patterns in the united states  south america  china and other grain producing areas  as such weather patterns might affect the planting  growing  harvesting and yield of feed grains  the expected size of the harvest of feed grains in the united states and other grain producing areas of the world as reported by governmental and private sources  current and expected changes to the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments  the relative strength of united states currency and expected changes therein as it might impact the ability of foreign countries to buy united states feed grain commodities  the current and expected volumes of export of feed grain commodities as reported by governmental and private sources  the current and expected use of available feed grains for uses other than as livestock feed grains such as the use of corn for the production of ethanol  which use is impacted by the price of crude oil  and current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products 
the company purchases physical grain  not financial instruments such as puts  calls or straddles that derive their value from the value of physical grain 
thus  the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined in asc  accounting for derivatives for instruments and hedging activities  or any market risk sensitive instruments of the type contemplated by item of regulation s k 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions or purchase any grain related contracts other than the physical grain contracts described above 
although the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined in asc or purchase market risk sensitive instruments of the type contemplated by item of regulation s k  the commodities that the company does purchase for physical delivery  primarily corn and soybean meal  are subject to price fluctuations that have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability as mentioned above 
during fiscal  the company purchased approximately million bushels of corn and approximately  tons of soybean meal for use in manufacturing feed for its live chickens 
thus  a change in the average market price paid per bushel for corn would have impacted the company s cash outlays for corn by approximately million in fiscal likewise  a change in the price paid per ton for soybean meal would impact the company s cash outlays by approximately million 
although changes in the market price paid for feed grains impact cash outlays at the time the company purchases the grain  such changes do not immediately impact cost of sales 
the cost of feed grains is recognized in cost of sales  on a first in first out basis  at the same time that the sales of the chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized 
thus  there is a lag between the time cash is paid for feed ingredients and the time the cost of such feed ingredients is reported in cost of goods sold 
for example  corn delivered to a feed mill and paid for one week might be used to manufacture feed the following week 
however  the chickens that eat that feed might not be processed and sold for another days  and only at that time will the costs of the feed consumed by the chicken become included in cost of goods sold 
during fiscal  the company s average feed cost per pound of broilers processed totaled per pound 
feed costs per pound of broilers processed consist primarily of feed grains  but also include other feed ingredients such as vitamins  fat and mineral feed supplements 
the average feed cost per pound is influenced not only by the price of feed ingredients  but also by the efficiency with which live chickens convert feed into body weight 
factors such as weather  poultry husbandry  quality of feed ingredients and the quality and health of the bird  among others  affect the quantity of feed necessary to mature chickens to the target live weight and the efficiency of that process 
generally  however  a change in the average price paid per bushel of corn fed to a chicken during its life would have impacted average feed cost per pound of broilers processed by  based on the quantity of grain used during fiscal similarly  a change in the average price paid per ton of soybean meal would have influenced the average feed cost per pound of broilers processed by during fiscal 
table of contents the following table shows the impact of hypothetical changes in the price of corn and soybean meal on both the company s cash flow and cost of goods sold  based on quantities actually purchased in fiscal feed ingredient quantity purchased during fiscal hypothetical price change impact on cash outlay ultimate impact on feed cost per pound of broilers processed corn million bushels per bushel million lb processed soybean meal  tons per ton million lb processed the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
the company maintains certain of its debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt approximates the carrying amount at october  management believes the potential effects of near term changes in interest rates on the company s debt are not material 
the company is a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
