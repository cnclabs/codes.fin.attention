item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal year operations summary our income before income tax provision decreased million to a loss of million for fiscal year revenue less subcontract costs  which is a key performance measurement for our business  decreased million during fiscal year  due mainly to lower project work volumes in energy and mining sectors within our domestic and certain of our foreign markets  and higher net reserves for contract adjustments recorded as a reduction of revenue  which were required for projects in china and northern africa 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million software impairment charge related to certain software modules that do not meet the needs of users that rely on the system and will not provide any future service potential 
the software impairment charge is further described in item of this annual report 
lower revenue less subcontract costs and the software impairment charge noted above were partially offset by lower professional service costs and other direct project expenses as a result of lower project work volumes and other managed reductions in technical staff levels  and lower indirect expenses due primarily to managed reductions of staff levels in various administrative  marketing and other indirect departments 
liquidity and capital resources despite an operating loss for the fiscal year ended july   we maintained a strong liquidity position during the year 
cash generated from operations was million  which was adequate to fund investing and financing activities required to maintain our operations 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during fiscal year primarily due to million in dividend payments paid to shareholders during the year  which were not required for operations  but which were approved on a discretionary basis by the board of directors 

table of contents during fiscal years prior to  we expended significant resources and working capital on contracts in the middle east and china  which resulted in significant billed contract receivables that were not collected during those years  and which required additional borrowings from our existing lines of credit 
during january  we collected million of cash related to contract receivables in the middle east  which enabled us to reduce amounts outstanding under our lines of credit 
we believe that cash flows from us operations  available cash and cash equivalent balances in our domestic subsidiaries and remaining amounts available under lines of credit will be sufficient to cover working capital requirements of our us operations during the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
our foreign subsidiaries generate adequate cash flow to fund their operations 
we intend to reinvest foreign cash balances  net of any dividends paid from our foreign subsidiaries from time to time  into opportunities outside the us if the foreign cash and cash equivalents were needed to fund domestic operations  we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amounts repatriated 
cash and cash equivalents activity and balances are summarized in the following table

net cash used in investment activities during the fiscal year ended july  primarily resulted from the following activity purchases of property  building and equipment resulted in a use of million of cash  and acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in two majority owned subsidiaries  walsh environmental scientists engineers  llc walsh and gustavson associates  llc gustavson resulted in a use of million of cash 
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended july  primarily resulted from the following activity net repayment of borrowings against our lines of credit of million  which was made possible by the receipt of million of cash on aged outstanding receivables in the middle east  repayments of debt and capital lease obligations of million  dividend payments to common shareholders of million  and distributions to non controlling interests of million 

table of contents we maintain unsecured lines of credit available for working capital and letters of credit

the allowance for project disallowances is included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents significant concentrations of contract receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments are summarized in the following table 
balance at july  balance at july  region contract receivables allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments contract receivables allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments united states  canada and south america middle east africa asia totals during the three months ended july   we recorded million of specific write offs of aged and uncollectible contract receivables related to projects in china  the middle east and northern africa  which resulted in equivalent reductions in contract receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments 
the decision to write off these contract receivable balances was based on management s assessment that cash collections are not likely 
prior to these write off adjustments  combined contract receivables related to projects in the middle east  africa and asia represented and of total contract receivables at july  and  while the combined allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments related to these projects represented and  respectively  of the total allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments at those same period end dates 
these allowance percentages highlight our experience of the heightened operating risks ie  political  regulatory and cultural risks within these foreign regions in comparison with similar risks in the united states  canada and south america 
these heightened operating risks have ultimately resulted in higher counterparty  credit and liquidity risks as we expend resources that may not be recovered for several months  or at all 
middle east africa as of july   we recorded million of contract receivables and million of allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments related to specific projects in the middle east 
during the quarter ended january   we received million of cash related to one of these projects  which resulted in reductions in contract receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments of million and million  respectively 
this reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments was partially offset by million of contract adjustments recorded in response to continued aging of contract receivables related to other projects in the middle east 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of contract adjustments related to work completed for a project in northern africa  for which the client has not yet approved the project tasks as of july during the three months ended july   we recorded million of specific write offs of aged  uncollectible and fully reserved contract receivables related to projects in the middle east and africa  which resulted in equivalent reductions in contract receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments 
asia in january  we announced that we had entered into contracts to provide environmental consulting services to a client in china 
the contracts replaced a previous agreement from fiscal year through july   we recorded million of contract receivables related to these agreements in china 
since inception of these agreements  we encountered significant operational project issues and delays in collecting required contractual advance payments due to us 

table of contents after considering the age of the related contract receivables  non payment of required contractual advance payments owed to us and the lack of any other cash collections to date  management concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year that the contract receivables from the client in china were uncollectible  and we recorded million of contract adjustments during the quarter  of which million related to revenue and contract receivables recorded during fiscal year for all of fiscal year  we recorded million of contract adjustments related to these contract receivables 
the total allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments related to these contracts  prior to write off of the fully reserved contract receivable balance during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  was million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management suspended all project activity related to these contracts 
during the three months ended july   the company recorded million of specific write offs of aged  uncollectible and fully reserved contract receivables related to projects in china  which resulted in equivalent reductions in contract receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments 
property  plant and equipment  net during fiscal years and  the company acquired and developed a new operating and financial software system for use by eei and its us and foreign subsidiaries 
through july   the company capitalized million of expenditures for the acquisition and development of this system  which was being amortized over a year useful life 
during the quarter ended july   management assessed the utility and effectiveness of various modules included in the software package  and determined that certain software modules do not meet the needs of users that rely on the system and will not provide any future service potential 
as a result  the company recorded a software impairment charge of million during the three months ended july   which is included in administrative and indirect operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations

however  the mix of domestic and foreign earnings that created a small consolidated pre tax loss  and the impact of permanent book to tax differences that are recognized regardless of pre tax income or loss  resulted in an unusual negative effective income tax rate for fiscal year these permanent differences primarily include non deductible expenses in the us and peru  the establishment of a valuation allowance for losses in canada and foreign dividend income that is taxed in the us as a result of a reduced foreign tax credit created from the company s overall foreign loss 
the income tax provision decreased million during fiscal year  primarily as a result of decreased pre tax income in both foreign and domestic operations 
lower pre tax income was partially offset by higher dividends from our foreign subsidiaries  for which we did not receive a foreign tax credit that we benefited from in prior years  and establishment of a valuation allowance for losses in canada 
at july   us net operating losses were approximately million  which management intends on carrying back to the july  fiscal year to obtain a refund

critical accounting policies the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operating results are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents many of our significant accounting policies require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities 
in making these judgments  management must make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
because changes in such estimates and assumptions could significantly affect our reported financial position and results of operations  detailed policies and control procedures have been established to ensure that valuation methods  including judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  independently reviewed  and are applied consistently from period to period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure that they are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
of the significant policies used to prepare our consolidated financial statements  the items discussed below require critical accounting estimates involving a high degree of judgment and complexity 
for all of these critical policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the professional and technical services performed by its employees or  in certain cases  by subcontractors engaged to perform on under contracts entered into with our clients 
the revenues recognized  therefore  are derived from our ability to charge clients for those services under the contracts 
sales and cost of sales at our south american subsidiaries exclude tax assessments by governmental authorities  which are collected by us from its customers and then remitted to governmental authorities 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from environmental consulting work 
the consulting revenue is principally derived from the sale of labor hours 
the consulting work is performed under a mix of fixed price  cost type  and time and material contracts 
contracts are required from all customers 
revenue is recognized as follows contract type work type revenue recognition policy time and materials consulting as incurred at contract rates 
fixed price consulting percentage of completion  approximating the ratio of either total costs or level of effort loe hours incurred to date to total estimated costs or loe hours 
cost plus consulting costs as incurred 
fixed fee portion is recognized using percentage of completion determined by the percentage of loe hours incurred to total loe hours in the respective contracts 
revenues associated with these contract types are summarized in the following table 
twelve months ended july  time and materials fixed price cost plus total revenue fixed price contracts generally present the highest level of financial and performance risk  but often also provide the highest potential financial returns 
cost plus contracts present a lower risk  but generally provide lower returns and often include more onerous terms and conditions 
time and materials contracts generally represent the time spent by our professional staff at stated or negotiated billing rates 
fixed price contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as project progress occurs 
time and material contracts are accounted for over the period of performance  in proportion to the costs of performance  predominately based on labor hours incurred 
if an estimate of costs at completion on any contract indicates that a loss will be incurred  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss becomes evident 

table of contents the percentage of completion revenue recognition method requires the use of estimates and judgment regarding a project s expected revenues  costs and the extent of progress towards completion 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenue and contract completion costs 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual completion costs may vary significantly from estimates 
most of our percentage of completion projects follow a method which approximates the cost to cost method of determining the percentage of completion 
under the cost to cost method  we make periodic estimates of our progress towards project completion by analyzing costs incurred to date  plus an estimate of the amount of costs that we expect to incur until the completion of the project 
revenue is then calculated on a cumulative basis project to date as the total contract value multiplied by the current percentage of completion 
the revenue for the current period is calculated as cumulative revenues less project revenues already recognized 
the recognition of revenues and profit is dependent upon a variety of estimates which can be difficult to accurately determine until a project is significantly underway 
for projects where the cost to cost method does not appropriately reflect the progress on the projects  we use alternative methods such as actual labor hours  for measuring progress on the project and recognize revenue accordingly 
for instance  in a project where a large amount of equipment is purchased or an extensive amount of mobilization is involved  including these costs in calculating the percentage of completion may overstate the actual progress on the project 
for these types of projects  actual labor hours spent on the project may be a more appropriate measure of the progress on the project 
our contracts with the us government contain provisions requiring compliance with the federal acquisition regulation far  and the cost accounting standards cas 
these regulations are generally applicable to all of our federal government contracts and are partially or fully incorporated in many local and state agency contracts 
they limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts subject to the far 
cost plus contracts covered by the far provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from the estimate billed 
most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
federal government contracts are subject to the far and some state and local governmental agencies require audits  which are performed for the most part by the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the dcaa audits overhead rates  cost proposals  incurred government contract costs  and internal control systems 
during the course of its audits  the dcaa may question incurred costs if it believes we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the far or cas and recommend that our us government financial administrative contracting officer disallow such costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of such audits 
however  we can provide no assurance that such audits will not result in material disallowances of incurred costs in the future 
we maintain an allowance for project disallowances in other accrued liabilities for potential cost disallowances resulting from government audits and project close outs 
government audits have been completed for fiscal years through and final rates have been negotiated for fiscal years through we have estimated our exposure based on completed audits  historical experience and discussions with the government auditors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to adjust its recorded allowance for project disallowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contract adjustments we reduce our contract receivables by recording an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated credit losses resulting from a client s inability or unwillingness to pay valid obligations to us 
the resulting provision for bad debts is recorded within administrative and indirect operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
the likelihood that the customer will pay is based on the judgment of those closest to the related project and the customer 
at a minimum  management considers the following factors to determine the collectability of contract receivables for any specific project 
table of contents customer acknowledgment of amount owed to us  customer liquidity ability to pay  historical experience with collections from the customer  amount of time elapsed since last payment  and economic  geopolitical and cultural considerations for the home country of the customer 
we recognize that there is a high degree of subjectivity and imprecision inherent in the process of estimating future credit losses that are based on historical trends and customer data 
as a result  actual credit losses can differ from these estimates 
we also reduce contract receivables by establishing an allowance for billed and earned contract revenues that have become unrealizable  or may become unrealizable in the future 
management reviews contract receivables and determines allowances amounts based on our operating performance related to the adequacy of the services performed  the status of change orders and claims  our historical experience with the customer settling change orders and claims  and economic  geopolitical and cultural considerations for the home country of the customer 
we recognize that there is a high degree of subjectivity and imprecision inherent in the process of estimating contract allowances that are based on historical trends and customer data 
as a result  actual contract losses can differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill of million on our consolidated balance sheets represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in various business acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently if events  transactions or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we utilize a discounted cash flows methodology for determining the fair value of the business units to which goodwill has been assigned 
our discounted cash flows methodology includes the following critical assumptions growth rates applied to projected earnings discount rates and terminal year growth rates applied to future cash flow projections our impairment testing of goodwill is considered to be a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment required for certain assumptions utilized in the models to determine fair value 
assumptions used involve a high degree of subjectivity that is based on historical experience and internal forecasts of future results 
actual results in future periods may not necessarily approximate historical experience or forecasts 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july   and concluded that our recorded goodwill was not at risk for impairment as of that date 
as of july   the estimated fair values of each of the individual business units to which goodwill has been assigned exceeded their carrying values by at least million 
income taxes we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and in foreign countries 
the calculations of income tax expense or benefit and related balance sheet amounts involve a high degree of management judgment regarding estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of revenue and deductions 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret laws differently than we do 
we are subject to audit in all of our tax jurisdictions  which may involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
ultimate resolution of tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to our net income and or cash flows 
in management s opinion  adequate reserves have been recorded for any future taxes that may be owed as a result of examination by any taxing authority 

table of contents a tax position is a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions shall be recognized only when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position will be sustained 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold should be measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in administrative and indirect operating expenses 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a tax position  is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence 
based on evidence available  management has determined that we did not have any uncertain tax positions at july  or deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
our policy is to establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
at july  and  we determined based on available evidence  including historical financial results for the last three years and forecasts of future results  that it is more likely than not that a portion of these items may not be recoverable in the future 
accordingly  we recorded total valuation allowances of million and million at july  and  respectively  as a reduction of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is considered to be a critical estimate because  in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers taxable income trends and forecasts 
actual income taxes expensed and or paid could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various factors  including changes to tax laws enacted by taxing authorities  final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities  and actual financial condition and results of operations for future periods that could differ from forecasted amounts 
changes in corporate entities noncontrolling interests are disclosed as a separate component of consolidated shareholders equity on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
earnings and other comprehensive income are separately attributed to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests 
earnings per share is calculated based on net loss income attributable to our controlling interests 
transactions with noncontrolling shareholders for the fiscal years ended july   and were recorded at amounts that approximated fair value 
effects on shareholders equity resulting from changes in eei s ownership interest in its subsidiaries are summarized in the following table
