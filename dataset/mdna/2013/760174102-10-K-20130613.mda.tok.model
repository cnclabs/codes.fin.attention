item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we have two operating divisions within our corporate structure and  accordingly  we report certain financial information by individual segment under this structure 
our ami division includes our media measurement services 
our he division includes our distribution services as well as services that measure  aggregate and report consumer rental and retail activity on film product from traditional brick and mortar  online and kiosk retailers 
our ami division encompasses media measurement services across multiple screens and platforms  and are primarily delivered via web based products within our entertainment essentials lines of business 
these services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  provide consumer viewership information  integrated with consumer segmentation and purchase behavior databases 
we provide film studios  television networks and stations  cable  satellite and telecommunications company telco operators  advertisers and advertising agencies insights into consumer viewing and purchasing patterns through our thorough and expansive databases of box office results and local  national  on demand and over the top television performance 
our he division services incorporate a unique set of applications designed to help clients maintain and direct their business practices relating to home video products 
entertainment content is distributed to various retailers primarily on behalf of motion picture studios 
we track and report performance of home entertainment products leased directly to video retailers or through our pay per transaction ppt system 
within this system  video retailers are given access to a wide selection of box office hits  independent releases and foreign films from the industry s leading suppliers on a revenue sharing basis 
we provide second and third tier retailers  as well as a few major national chains  the opportunity to acquire new inventory  and our ppt system enables retailers everywhere  regardless of size  the ability to increase the depth and breadth of their inventory  to more efficiently adjust ordering strategies to better satisfy consumer demand and to more effectively take advantage of trends and opportunities in the marketplace 
we lease product from our program suppliers  participating retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
participating retailers then share a portion of the revenue from each retail rental transaction with us  and we share a portion of the revenue with the program suppliers 
our ppt system supplies both content providers and retailers with the intelligence and infrastructure necessary to make revenue sharing a viable and productive option 
our he division also includes our drs services  which grant content providers constant  clear feedback and data  plus valuable checks and balances on how both their video products and retailers are performing 
data relating to rented entertainment content is received on physical product under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
see forward looking statements on page ami division our media measurement services  offered primarily on a recurring subscription basis  are distributed to clients through patent pending software systems and business processes 
our systems capture consumer viewership data from multiple screens across every platform within the entertainment industry and merge that information with advanced demographics and data relating to actual consumer purchase behavior 
our current spending  investments and long term strategic planning are heavily focused on the development  growth and expansion of our ami division  both domestically and internationally 
as such  we continue to allocate significant resources to our entertainment essentials services and product lines 
our ami division revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the ami division lines of business  which we refer to as entertainment essentials services  are box office essentials  ondemand everywhere  which includes ondemand essentials and related products  and tv essentials  which includes stationview essentials 
typical clients subscribing to our services include motion picture studios  television networks and stations  cable and telco operators  advertisers and advertising agencies 

table of contents he division the financial results from the he division continue to be negatively affected by the changing dynamics in the home video rental market 
this market is highly competitive  constantly changing and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns  behaviors and technological advancements 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select his or her entertainment content and can easily shift from one provider to another 
some examples include renting units from our participating retailers or other retailers  purchasing previously viewed units from our participating retailers or other retailers  renting or purchasing units from kiosk locations  ordering units via online subscriptions and or online distributors mail delivery  subscribing to at home movie channels  downloading or streaming content via the internet  purchasing and owning the unit directly or selecting an at home pay per view or on demand option from a satellite  telco or cable provider 
our ppt system focuses primarily on the traditional brick and mortar retailer and provides those participating retailers the opportunity to increase the depth and breadth of their inventory  to more efficiently adjust ordering strategies to better satisfy consumer demand and to more effectively take advantage of trends and opportunities in the marketplace 
many of our arrangements are structured so that participating retailers pay reduced upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering units of all titles offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
these programs offer participating retailers a way to more effectively acquire new release rental inventory on a lease basis instead of purchasing and owning the inventory directly 
the landscape of the home video rental market for brick and mortar retailers continues to see significant changes  and some major retailers  such as movie gallery  have exited the market entirely  while others  such as blockbuster have closed a significant number of stores 
as a result of these market changes  we believe the major brick and mortar retailers share of the overall industry is contracting 
it is difficult to predict what effect  if any  this will have on our program suppliers and or the performance of our participating retailers 
also  end consumers usage of non brick and mortar options for obtaining entertainment content  such as kiosks  continues to increase and our participating retailers market share has been negatively affected  contributing to a decline in our revenue 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  we added a major rental chain to our list of ppt customers and are providing units to that retailer from at least one major program supplier 
during fiscal  we generated revenue of million from this retailer 
in general  we continue to be in good standing with our program suppliers  and we make ongoing efforts to strengthen those business relationships through enhancements to our current service offerings and the development of new service offerings 
in the third quarter of fiscal  a former program supplier  warner bros  returned to the ppt system  and we were able to begin offering their content to our participating retailers again 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers and in the last quarter  we have seen an increased interest in our offerings as program suppliers look for ways to reduce expenses 
it is too soon to tell what impact  if any  this will have on total revenue in the future 
our relationships with program suppliers may typically be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
sources of revenue revenue by segment includes the following ami division subscription fee and other revenue  primarily relating to custom reports  from our entertainment essentials services 
he division ppt revenue includes fees generated when participating retailers rent units or sell previously viewed rental units to consumers and upfront fees generated when units are distributed to participating retailers 
additionally  certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers  which are recognized on the street release date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  and drs fees  which are generated from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers

these fluctuations are described in more detail below 
revenue decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue was due to a decline in revenue from our he division  partially offset by an increase in ami revenue  primarily related to growth in our existing lines of business as described in more detail below 
ami division revenue related to our entertainment essentials business information service offerings increased primarily due to the addition of new customers  rate increases from existing customers and expansion of our systems and service offerings 
we expect continued future increases in our entertainment essentials revenue as a result of further investments  development and expansion of new and existing services  both domestically and internationally

the increase in tv essentials revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the addition of new clients  including local stations  networks and advertising agencies 
he division revenue information related to our he division is as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  dollar change change ppt drs year ended march  dollar change change ppt drs the decrease in ppt revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in transaction fees of million  and a decline in sell through and order processing fees of million 
these decreases were primarily due to fewer participating retailers  fewer available units and lower box office performance from theatrical titles in fiscal compared to fiscal  in part due to consumers focus on the summer olympics during the second quarter of fiscal  as well as continued changing market conditions 
also  during the third quarter of fiscal  warner bros 
decided it would release its video content 
table of contents in the retail channel before offering it to the rental market 
this had a negative effect on our ppt business during the first nine months of fiscal however  during the third quarter of fiscal  warner bros 
returned to its previous distribution strategy of providing brick and mortar retailers with new release content on the initial street date  and we were able to offer some warner bros 
units to our participating retailers 
we expect this change will have a positive impact on our revenue in the future  but it is too soon to predict the magnitude of the impact 
additionally  we added a significant participating retailer to our ppt system which contributed to an overall increase in units shipped during the quarter and helped to narrow the decline in ppt revenue 
we also expect higher volumes and increased revenue from this participating retailer going forward  but since this is dependent on various factors  like the availability and quality of units  we are unable to estimate the how much the increase will be  if any 
the decrease in ppt revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in transaction fees of million  and a decline sell through and order processing fees of million 
these decreases were due primarily to fewer participating retailers  fewer available units and lower box office performance from theatrical titles in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as continued changing market conditions 
during the third quarter of fiscal  warner bros 
decided to release its video content in the retail channel before offering it in the rental market  which had a negative impact on the number of units available to us and represented of the decline in revenue 
the decrease in drs revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to fewer transactions processed as a result of warner bros 
decision in the third quarter of fiscal mentioned above  as well as a decline in the number of direct retailers from which to track content performance for program suppliers 
we believe the modification of warner bros 
distribution strategy in the third quarter of fiscal noted above should increase our drs revenue  but it is too soon to predict what impact  if any  this will have on our revenue in the future 
the decrease in drs revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to fewer transactions  primarily as a result of a decline in transactions from blockbuster  offset by an increase in revenue of million as a result of our acquisition of media salvation during the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales represents the direct costs to produce revenue 
in the ami division  cost of sales includes costs relating to our entertainment essentials services  and consists of costs associated with the operation of a call center for our box office essentials services  as well as costs associated with amortizing capitalized  internally developed software used to provide the corresponding services and direct costs incurred to obtain  cleanse and process data and maintain our systems 
in the he division  cost of sales includes unit costs  transaction costs  sell through costs and freight costs 
sell through costs represent the amounts due to the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
our cost of sales can also be affected by the release dates of units with guarantees 
we recognize the guaranteed minimum costs on the release date 
the terms of some of our agreements result in recognition of of the cost of sales on titles in the first month in which the unit is released  which results in lower margins during the initial portion of the revenue sharing period 
once the unit s rental activity exceeds the required amount for these guaranteed minimums  margins generally expand during the second and third months of the unit s revenue sharing period 
however  since these factors are highly dependent upon the quality  timing and release dates of all new units  margins may not expand to any significant degree during any reporting period 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the effect these program supplier revenue sharing programs with guaranteed minimums will have on future results of operations in any reporting period 
cost of sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents ami division cost of sales information related to our ami division is as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  dollar change change costs related to amortization of internally developed software call center operation obtaining  cleansing and processing data year ended march  dollar change change costs related to amortization of internally developed software call center operation obtaining  cleansing and processing data the increase in cost of sales within the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from expanding market coverage with existing data supplier agreements  the addition of new data supplier agreements and the amendment to our data supplier agreement with dish  which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal  and requires minimum payments relating to predefined net profit sharing provisions of portions of our tv essentials line of business 
the increase in cost of sales within the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from arrangements with some of our data suppliers that provide for cost increases as our revenue increases  the conversion of a data supplier agreement from a variable arrangement to a fixed fee arrangement in december  and increases in costs related to obtaining  cleansing and processing data due to arrangements in place with data providers

table of contents gross margins as a percentage of revenue were as follows year ended march  ami division he division the decline in gross margin in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a shift in mix of revenue  as more revenue in the current year was generated from tv essentials  which has a lower gross margin than box office essentials or on demand everywhere 
the decrease in gross margin in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased costs associated with one of our data provider agreements  which converted to a fixed fee agreement in the third quarter of fiscal  and higher costs associated with amortization of our internally developed systems 
the decrease in gross margin in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a shift in mix of revenue to less drs revenue  which typically has higher margins 
the increase in gross margin in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to fewer total available and rented units including minimum guarantees 
as noted previously  guarantee units can result in cost of sales on the titles in the first month in which they are released 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expense information is as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  dollar change change selling and administrative ami he corporate year ended march  dollar change change selling and administrative ami he corporate ami division the increase in selling and administrative expense in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to million of increased expense related to the cancellation of a stock award granted to dish that had been previously revalued at the end of each reporting period 
in exchange for canceling the stock award and as compensation for past services  dish was paid million and issued  shares of our common stock during the second quarter of fiscal  and we recorded million in expense related to this amendment and related stock award 
excluding the impact of the dish amendment  expenses increased million primarily related to increased headcount and other costs associated with the expansion of tv essentials 

table of contents the increase in selling and administrative expense in the ami division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and other costs associated with the expansion of our ami division of million and reorganization costs of million related to our international operations  offset by a reduction of million of expense related to the value of the stock award granted to dish that was revalued at the end of each reporting period 
our long term strategic plan is heavily focused on the development  growth and expansion of our ami division  both domestically and internationally  and we consider these expenses to be investments which will leverage this business 
he division the decrease in selling and administrative expense in the he division in fiscal compared fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in overall headcount in order to better align the number of employees with current and expected future trends in this division 
the decrease in selling and administrative expense in the he division in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in overall headcount for the year 
corporate the increase in corporate selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in headcount in our information technology department and higher stock based compensation costs as a result of equity awards granted in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in corporate selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher maintenance  occupancy and general operating costs  offset by lower stock based compensation expense  lower costs for fringe benefits and increases in capitalized software development costs 
income loss from operations income loss from operations information is as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  dollar change change income loss from operations ami he corporate year ended march  dollar change change income loss from operations ami he corporate the increase in loss from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in expense in our ami division related to the amendment of our agreement with dish as discussed above 
operating loss for the ami division includes the impact of a non recurring compensation expense of million relating to the dish amendment 
other income expense  net other income of million in fiscal represented a gain on the liquidation of a long term  cost based investment 
income taxes our effective tax rate was an expense of for fiscal and was driven by taxable income in some jurisdictions 
the expected benefit from losses in other jurisdictions did not benefit the rate due to the recording of a valuation allowance 

table of contents primarily due to our investments in acquisitions  as well as expansion of our ami division and our equity compensation structure  we have cumulative operating losses over the past three fiscal years 
as a result  we evaluated various factors relating to these assets and determined in fiscal that it was not more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance 
this position did not change in fiscal in the future  if we generate taxable income  we would re evaluate our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets and the need for the valuation allowance  which could reduce future tax expense 
our effective tax rate was an expense of in fiscal the rate was negatively affected by the recording of a million valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal the rate was positively impacted by federal and state research and experimentation credits of million  earnings on marketable securities that are exempt from federal income taxes of million and the tax impact of income in foreign locations of million  offset by increases in reserves on tax positions of million 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash expected to be generated from future operations and investments and our ability to borrow on our million line of credit 
based on our current financial projections and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued current development of our business information services and other cash requirements through at least april  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million to million at march  from march  this decrease resulted primarily from million used for the purchase of equipment and capitalized information technology costs and million used in operating activities  which includes a million payment related to the amendment of our agreement with dish  offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and a million contribution from noncontrolling interests 
portions of our cash and cash equivalents are held in our foreign subsidiaries 
in the event the foreign subsidiaries repatriate these earnings  the earnings may be subject to united states federal  state and foreign income taxes 
as of march   we had million in foreign bank accounts  of which we plan to use million to fund our international expansion and growth 
the remaining cash is held by sinotrak  our chinese joint venture  and will be used to support growth for that operation 
we had million invested in an adjustable rate governmental bond fund as of march  bond fund values fluctuate in response to the financial condition of individual issues  general market and economic conditions and changes in interest rates 
in general  when interest rates rise  bond fund values fall and investors may lose principal value 
while we currently have no plans or requirements to sell the securities in the foreseeable future  we are exposed to market risks and cannot predict what impact fluctuations in the market may have on the value of these funds 
accounts and notes receivable  net of allowances  increased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to higher revenue in the he division in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal and growth in our ami division 
other current assets increased million to million at march  from march  primarily due to a million receivable from our landlord for a portion of the costs related to renovations made to our new york office 
this amount is treated as a lease incentive  the value of which will reduce rent expense over the remaining lease term 
during fiscal  we spent million on property and equipment  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business information service offerings 
we anticipate spending a total of approximately million on property and equipment in all of fiscal  of which approximately million is for the capitalization of internally developed software  primarily for the development of systems for our entertainment essentials lines of business 
the remaining amounts include primarily purchases of computers  servers and networking equipment 
accrued liabilities increased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to increased expenses incurred related to our data suppliers 

table of contents accrued compensation decreased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to a million decrease in accrued stock based compensation for dish s award that was canceled and settled in cash during the second quarter of fiscal and  a million decrease in severance accruals relating to payments made during fiscal as a result of the reorganization of our foreign operations  offset by million in increases in payroll and bonus related accruals 
deferred revenue and other credits increased million to million at march  from march   primarily due to the growth in our ami division 
this balance includes amounts related to quarterly and annual subscriptions for our services  as well as the current portion of our deferred rent credits 
deferred rent of million at march   which includes both the current and long term portion  represents amounts received for qualified renovations to our corporate headquarters and our offices in new york  as well as free rent for a portion of the lease terms 
the deferred rent related to qualified renovations is being amortized against rent expense over the remaining lease terms  which extend through june   at the rate of approximately  per quarter 
the deferred rent related to free rent is also being amortized against rent expense over the remaining lease term and is expected to be approximately  per quarter for fiscal in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
as of march    shares remained available for repurchase under this plan at a per share price not to exceed 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
common stock repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions 
the amount and timing of all repurchase transactions are contingent upon market conditions  regulatory requirements and alternative investment opportunities 
we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal we currently have a revolving line of credit for million that matures december  interest accrues on outstanding balances under the line of credit at a rate equal to libor plus per annum  and we incur fees on the unused portion at per annum 
the credit line is secured by substantially all of our assets and includes certain financial covenants 
at march   issued and outstanding letters of credit of million were reserved against the line of credit  and we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
the agreement contains certain liquidity  asset and financial covenants and  as of march   we were in compliance with those covenants 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we received a loan from the state of oregon for million for the purpose of facility renovations 
the loan bears interest at per annum and contains provisions relating to forgiveness if we meet certain requirements 
as of march   we were on schedule toward meeting those requirements and  on april   the loan was forgiven in full 
the balance of this loan will be recorded as an offset to leasehold improvements and will be amortized as an offset to depreciation expense over the life of the related lease 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  follows dollars in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total and and and beyond operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for all of our services when all of the following conditions are met 
table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been delivered  for units released within our he division  we believe this condition is met when the film is complete and  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  has been delivered or is available for immediate and unconditional delivery  the license period has begun which is referred to as the street date for a he product  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is reasonably assured based on our collection history 
within our ami division  subscription fees are recognized ratably over the period of service 
we also generate revenue by providing information obtained from our database in the form of custom reports 
revenue related to custom reports is recognized as value is delivered to the customer 
the pattern of revenue recognition for these reports varies depending on the terms of the individual contracts and may be recognized proportionally or deferred until the end of the contract term and recognized when the information has been delivered and accepted by the customer 
within our he division  our agreements generally provide for an initial order processing fee and continuing transaction fees based on a percentage of rental revenue earned by the participating retailer upon renting the units to their customers 
initial order processing fees cover the direct costs of accessing units from program suppliers and handling  packaging and shipping of the units to the retailer 
once the units are shipped  we have no further obligation to provide services to the participating retailer 
we recognize order processing fees as revenue on the street date and recognize transaction fees when the units are rented to the consumers  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain arrangements include guaranteed minimum revenue from our customers as well as our suppliers  which vary by studio and relate to single films  typically major motion picture releases 
these guarantees  which totaled million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and  are contractually fixed on the street date and are nonrefundable 
we follow accounting standards codification  which applies to the entertainment films industry  and requires that the entire amount of these minimum guarantees be recognized as revenue  along with the corresponding cost  on the street date  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at march  and  respectively

deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes  from tax credits which have not been utilized  and from net operating loss carry forwards 
we calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted laws and tax rates that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse and be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a deferred tax asset is not recorded for net operating loss carryforwards created by excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
to the extent such net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  stockholders equity will increase 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our federal net operating and capital loss carry forwards  as well as those net operating and capital loss carry forwards in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
as of march  and  net deferred tax liabilities totaled  and  respectively 

table of contents accounting for unrecognized tax benefits we record a benefit for uncertain tax positions only when we determine that those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
as of march  and  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively  including penalties and interest of  and  respectively 
all unrecognized tax benefits at march  would affect the effective tax rate if recognized

note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software capitalized software  which is included in property and equipment  net  consists of costs to purchase and develop internal use software  as well as costs to develop internal software  which is used by us to provide various services to clients 
the internal and external costs to develop the internal software used to support these services are capitalized after the technological and business feasibility of the project is determined and the preliminary project stage is completed 
we continue to develop our internal software systems in order to expand our service offerings 
once this software is ready for use in our products  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is five years from the date of utilization 
capitalized software is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on these reviews  we recorded impairment charges of  in fiscal no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal or changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of those assets 
capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million at march  and  respectively 
we also had million and million as of march  and  respectively  of capitalized costs associated with software projects which are still in the application development stage 
stock based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  deferred stock units dsus  stock appreciation rights sars  stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars  restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase plan espp shares  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model and monte carlo simulations for valuing our stock based awards with a conversion or exercise price 
the use of the black scholes and monte carlo valuation models to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest and market based awards 
however  we have not reduced the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures because there is no basis for estimating future forfeitures since most unvested awards are held by members of senior management 
we update for forfeitures as they occur and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures are significant  our results of operations could be materially affected 
stock based compensation agreements with non employees we are required to recognize compensation expense for stock based compensation agreements with non employees based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date and at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model to determine the end of period fair value of these awards and record the cumulative incremental change in value as compensation expense over the life of the award 
marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  they are marked to market on a quarterly basis  with unrealized gains and losses being excluded from earnings and reflected as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
dividend and interest income is recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets of accounting standards codification and the provisions of accounting standards update  testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if  after completing our qualitative assessment  we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  we compare the fair value to our carrying value including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value  we conclude that no impairment exists 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value  resulting in goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including changes in forecasted operating results and a comparison of actual results to projections  changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date  changes in the overall economy  our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date  trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values  trends in peer companies total enterprise value metrics  and additional factors such as management turnover and changes in regulations 
based on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of march  and  therefore  determined it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we amortize intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we evaluate the estimated remaining lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
we test these assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired  based on undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets 
there were no impairment charges related to intangible assets during the years ended march   and new accounting guidance see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate globally and have exposure to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in most markets  we generate revenue and expenses in local currencies 
foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities statements of operations and balance sheets from functional currency to our reporting currency the united states dollar for consolidation purposes 
our most significant foreign currency risks relate to the euro  the argentine peso and the canadian dollar 
we have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in currency rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  assuming a decrease in the value of foreign currencies in which we operate 
our analysis has determined that a decrease in value would have resulted in a  increase to our operating loss for the year ended march  we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  our cash deposits 
our marketable securities are investments in an adjustable rate governmental bond fund 
we monitor this account regularly and have evaluated and assessed the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
unrealized gains and losses on these investments will fluctuate and  historically  have not been significant 
our unrealized loss on this investment as of march  was immaterial
