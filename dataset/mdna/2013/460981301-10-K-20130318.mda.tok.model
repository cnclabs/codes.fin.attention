item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we have three reportable operating segments with continuing operations through the year ended december  our consumer products and services segment includes our credit and personal information  identity theft protection  data breach response  and insurance and membership services 
our online brand protection segment includes the corporate brand protection and business intelligence services provided by our subsidiaries net enforcers and intersections business intelligence services 
our bail bonds industry solutions segment includes the software management solutions for the bail bond industry provided by our subsidiary captira analytical 
in addition  until the sale of screening international  llc on july   we had a fourth reportable segment  our background screening segment  which included personnel and vendor background screening services 
consumer products and services our identity theft protection and credit information management products and services provide multiple benefits to consumers  including access to their credit reports  credit monitoring  educational scores  credit education  reports and monitoring of additional information  identity theft recovery services  identity theft cost reimbursement insurance  and software and other technology tools and services 
our membership and insurance products and services are offered by our subsidiary  intersections insurance services  and include accidental death and disability and property and casualty insurance and access or purchasing programs for healthcare  home  auto  financial and other services and information 
we also offer breach response services to organizations responding to compromises of sensitive personal information 
we help these clients notify the affected individuals and we provide the affected individuals with identity theft recovery and credit monitoring services 
our consumer products and services principally are offered through relationships with clients  and often are customized and branded to meet their needs 
most of subscribers for our services were acquired through our financial institution clients 
we also offer our services through clients in other industries and directly to consumers 
with our clients  our services are or have been marketed to potential subscribers and non subscriber customers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet and broadcast media 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  print marketing  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing and email  and through marketing and distribution relationships 

table of contents our client arrangements are distinguished from one another primarily by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these commissions could be payable upfront in a lump sum on a per newly enrolled subscriber basis  periodically over the life of a subscriber  or through a combination of both 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements  we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client  and we may reimburse the client for certain of its out of pocket marketing costs incurred in obtaining the subscriber 
even in a direct marketing arrangement  some marketing channels may entail limited or no marketing expenses 
in those cases  we generally pay higher commissions to our clients compared to channels where we incur more substantial marketing expenses 
in addition to these direct marketing arrangements with clients  the financial results we report under direct marketing includes our direct marketing to consumers independent of these client arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
indirect marketing arrangements also include some clients who pay us fees for operational services including but not limited to fulfillment events  information technology development hours or customer service activities 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements 
the majority of our non subscriber customers are acquired under indirect marketing relationships that primarily generate little or no revenue per customer for us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct or indirect is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct or indirect 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in the past  we have purchased from clients certain customer portfolios  including the rights to future cash flows 
we typically classify the post purchase customer portfolio as a direct marketing arrangement regardless of how it may have been characterized prior to purchase because we receive all future revenues and bear all associated risks and expenses for these customers following the purchase transaction 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect marketing arrangements  provide that after termination of the contract we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers for periods ranging from two years to indefinite  substantially under the applicable terms in effect at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services under existing subscriptions 
clients under most contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us or based on various events such as certain legal or regulatory changes  a party s bankruptcy or insolvency  or other events 
even in contracts under which we have a right to provide our services to existing subscribers after termination  we often are substantially dependent on those clients to cooperate in allowing continued servicing  including continued billing by those clients 
we historically have depended upon a few large financial institutions in the united states for a significant portion of our new subscriber additions and our revenue 
for example  in and  approximately of both our new subscribers and our consumer products and services revenue were derived from agreements with us financial institutions  with revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest client  bank of america  as 
table of contents a percentage of consumer products and services revenue  constituting approximately in and in financial institutions have also ceased or substantially decreased their marketing of add on or ancillary products  including our products  due to a number of factors  including increased regulatory scrutiny 
as a result  our new subscriber additions were lower in compared to we do not know whether the marketing of our products by financial institutions will be resumed  or whether  if resumed  they will return to prior levels 
some financial institution clients have suspended billing of certain subscribers  and may suspend billing of or cancel other subscribers 
we believe these cancellations and suspensions are based on regulatory actions or changes in the regulatory environment 
as a result our revenue decreased in  and we expect our revenue and earnings to decrease in as compared to we may increase our level of marketing with non financial institution clients and through our consumer direct marketing  but do not know whether we will be successful in replacing the subscribers and revenue we lose through cancellations and decreased marketing by financial institutions 
for example  bank of america has ceased marketing of our services  and the portions of our agreement with bank of america under which our identity theft protection services were being marketed to prospective subscribers expired on december  as a result  we are not obtaining new subscribers or new subscriber revenue through bank of america  and expect a continued reduction in marketing and commissions expenses 
we continue to provide our services to the subscribers we acquired through bank of america before december  we believe that our agreement with bank of america provides for us to continue to service those subscribers substantially under the applicable terms currently in effect 
under our agreement  however  bank of america may require us to cease providing services to the existing subscribers if the agreement is terminated for material breach by us or based on various events such as certain legal or regulatory changes 
we do not know whether bank of america will agree with our interpretation of our agreement  and there can be no guarantee that bank of america will continue to provide the cooperation necessary to continued servicing of the subscribers  including continued billing of the subscribers 
bank of america has indicated that it has been responding to inquiries from regulatory authorities regarding identity theft protection products  which we believe include our products and products from a different provider 
the following table shows the amount of our total subscribers between indirect marketing arrangements and direct marketing arrangements as of december  in thousands indirect marketing arrangements direct marketing arrangements total subscribers over the last few years  subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from direct marketing arrangements were in  in and in the continuing decrease in direct marketing arrangements is due to a reduction in new subscribers as a result of the decision by bank of america to stop marketing our services under our direct marketing arrangement and the decisions by other financial institution clients to halt  reduce or delay marketing of our products and services 
this was partially offset by increased subscribers from our direct to consumer business and growth in our indirect marketing arrangements 
the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions was in  in  and 
table of contents in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  was in  in and in the increase in the retention rate is primarily due to the addition of subscribers that were new to us in we regularly re negotiate and adjust the products  retail pricing  pricing of our contracts  and marketing opportunities with our top revenue producing clients 
we expect some of these changes to affect the sales volumes  sales mix and profitability of our client marketing programs 
further  we expect increasing regulation and scrutiny regarding the marketing of fee based products and services by financial institutions to result in fewer marketing opportunities for us in the current year as compared to prior years 
online brand protection through our subsidiaries  net enforcers and intersections business intelligence services  we provide corporate brand and product monitoring services including online channel monitoring  auction monitoring and other services 
our services utilize proprietary technology to search ecommerce retail sites for instances of specific brands and or products  categorize each instance and report ecommerce market findings back to our clients 
our services are typically priced as monthly subscriptions for a defined set of monitoring services 
prices for our services vary based upon the specific configuration of services purchased by each client and range from several hundred dollars per month to tens of thousands of dollars per month 
beginning in  we began recognizing expenses in this segment for a new corporate service we intend to launch in early bail bonds industry solutions through our subsidiary  captira analytical  we provide automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry 
these services include accounting  reporting  and decision making tools which allow bail bondsmen  general agents and sureties to run their offices more efficiently  to exercise greater operational and financial control over their businesses  and to make better underwriting decisions 
we believe these services are the only fully integrated suite of bail bonds management applications of comparable scope available in the marketplace today 
these services are sold to retail bail bondsman on a per seat license basis plus additional transactional charges for various optional services 
additionally  this segment has developed a suite of services for bail bonds insurance companies  general agents and sureties which are sold on either a transactional or recurring revenue basis 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our consolidated results of operations 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on identity theft and credit management services  accidental death insurance and other membership products 
our products and services are offered to consumers principally on a monthly subscription basis 
subscription fees are generally billed to the subscriber s credit card  mortgage bill or demand deposit accounts by our clients  but may be billed by us in some circumstances 
the prices to subscribers of various configurations of 
table of contents our products and services range generally from to per month 
as a means of allowing customers to become familiar with our services  our subscriptions typically are offered with trial  delayed billing or guaranteed refund periods 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
identity theft and credit management services we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as we maintain signed contracts with all of our large financial institution customers and paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchasers  b delivery has occurred  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as sales are generally based on contract or list prices and d collectability is reasonably assured as individual customers pay by credit card which has limited our risk of non collection and payments from large financial institutions are collected within to days with no significant write offs 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
we also generate revenue through a collaborative arrangement which involves joint marketing and servicing activities 
we recognize our share of revenues and expenses from this arrangement 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service 
annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for discretionary subscription refunds is established based on our historical experience 
for subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
in some instances  we recognize revenue for the delivery of operational services including but not limited to fulfillment events  information technology development hours or customer service minutes  rather than per customer fees 
we record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
accidental death insurance we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as we maintain paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchasers  b delivery has occurred at the completion of a product trial period  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as the price of the product is agreed to by the customer as a condition of the sales transaction which established the sales arrangement  and d collectability is reasonably assured as evidenced by our collection of revenue through the monthly mortgage payments of our customers or through checking account debits to our customers accounts 
revenues from insurance contracts are recognized when earned 
marketing of our insurance products generally involves a trial period during which time the product is made available at no cost to the customer 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
for insurance products  we record revenue on a net basis as we perform as an agent or broker for the insurance products without assuming the risks of ownership of the insurance products 

table of contents we participate in agency relationships with insurance carriers that underwrite insurance products offered by us 
accordingly  insurance premiums collected from customers and remitted to insurance carriers are excluded from our revenues and operating expenses 
insurance premiums collected but not remitted to insurance carriers as of december  and totaled thousand and thousand  respectively  and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
other membership products for other membership products  we record revenue on a gross basis as we serve as the primary obligor in the transactions  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generate revenue from other types of subscription based products provided from our online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions segments 
we recognize revenue from corporate brand protection and monitoring services on a monthly or transactional basis 
we also recognize revenue from providing management service solutions on a monthly subscription or transactional basis 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets we record  as goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in purchase transactions 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually  as of october  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
as of december   goodwill of million resides in our consumer products and services reporting unit  resulting from our acquisition of intersections insurance services inc  which has been evaluated as part of our consumer products and services reporting unit 
there is no goodwill remaining in our other reporting units 
on january   we adopted an accounting standard update  commonly referred to as the step zero approach that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing 
for those reporting units where a significant change or event occurs  and where potential impairment indicators exist  we continue to utilize a two step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  b a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  c a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  d unanticipated competition  e the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and f slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using a combined income discounted cash flow valuation model and market based approach 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable companies 
the income approach measures the value of the reporting units by the present values of its economic benefits 
these benefits can include revenue and cost savings 
value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for use of funds  trends within the industry  and risks associated with particular investments of similar type and quality as of the valuation date 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections  and cost of capital discount rate 
the projections use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including business plans  growth rates in sales  costs  
table of contents and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  estimates of future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill 
we estimate fair value giving consideration to both the income and market approaches 
consideration is given to the line of business and operating performance of the entities being valued relative to those of actual transactions  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying value to measure the amount of impairment charge  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of that reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  property and equipment and other long term assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the future cash flows for assets involved 
in conducting our analysis  we would compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the net book value  the long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is measured and recognized 
an impairment charge is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows associated with these assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization may include trademarks and customer  marketing and technology related intangibles 
such intangible assets  excluding customer related intangibles  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally three to ten years 
customer related intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line or accelerated basis  dependent upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
deferred subscription solicitation and advertising our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
we expense advertising costs  such as broadcast media  the first time advertising takes place  except for direct response marketing costs 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response marketing costs  which are amortized on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future 
table of contents benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
commission costs commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed when incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of the subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
we have prepaid commission agreements with some of our clients 
under these agreements  we pay a commission on new subscribers in lieu of or for a reduction in ongoing commission payments 
we amortize these prepaid commissions  on an accelerated basis  over a period of time not to exceed three years 
the short term portion of the prepaid commissions is included in deferred subscription solicitation costs in our consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of the prepaid commissions is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization is included in commissions expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation we currently have three equity incentive plans  the and stock option plans and the stock incentive plan 
the stock incentive plan provide us with the opportunity to compensate selected employees with stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
a stock option entitles the recipient to purchase shares of common stock from us at the specified exercise price 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus entitle the recipient to obtain stock or stock units  
par value  which vests over a set period of time 
rsus are granted at no cost to the employee and employees do not need to pay an exercise price to obtain the underlying common stock 
all grants or awards made under the plans are governed by written agreements between us and the participants 
the active period for the plan expired on august  we use the black scholes option pricing model to value all options and the straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each option granted has been estimated as of the date of grant with the following weighted average assumptions expected dividend yield expected volatility risk free interest rate expected term of options years years in the year ended december   we did not grant options 

table of contents expected dividend yield 
the black scholes valuation model requires an expected dividend yield as an input 
prior to september  we had not issued dividends and  therefore  the dividend yield used in grants prior to september  was zero 
subsequent to september of  we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and accordingly  applied a dividend yield to grants in the year ended december  for future grants  we will apply a dividend yield based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
expected volatility 
in the year ended december   we revised our estimation method for calculating expected volatility to take account of the sufficient amount of available public share price data 
for the year ended december   the expected volatility of options granted was estimated based upon our historical share price volatility as well as the average volatility of comparable public companies 
for the year ended december   the expected volatility of options granted was estimated based solely upon our historical share price volatility 
we will continue to review our estimate in the future 
risk free interest rate 
the yield on actively traded non inflation indexed us treasury notes was used to extrapolate an average risk free interest rate based on the expected term of the underlying grants 
expected term 
the expected term of options granted during the years ended december  and was determined using the simplified calculation vesting term original contractual term 
for the majority of grants valued  the options had graded vesting over years equal vesting of options annually and the contractual term was years 
historically  based on the applicable provisions of us gaap and other relevant guidance  we did not believe we had sufficient historical experience to provide a reasonable basis with which to estimate the expected term and determined the use of the simplified method to be the most appropriate method 
beginning with the next significant option grant  we believe that we have accumulated sufficient exercise activity and we expect to derive our expected term from historical experience 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures based on historical option and restricted stock unit activity on a grant by grant basis 
we may make changes to that estimate throughout the vesting period based on actual activity 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the applicable provisions of us gaap  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
valuation allowances are provided  if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law 
as a matter of course  we may be audited by various taxing authorities and these audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
us gaap addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
accounting standards updates recently adopted in may  an update was made to fair value measurement 
the amendments in this update result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap 
some of the amendments clarify the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
other amendments 
table of contents change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption by public entities is not permitted 
we have adopted the provisions of this update as of january  and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  an update was made to comprehensive income 
this update was further amended in december in order to defer the changes that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
in this update an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the entity is also required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with the exception of the amendments that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments which have been deferred 
early adoption is permitted 
we have adopted the provisions of this update as of january  and due to the lack of  and immateriality of  comprehensive income historically and in the year ended december   we are not required to present comprehensive income and therefore  have not adjusted our financial statement presentation or the related notes 
in september  an update was made to intangibles goodwill and other 
this update is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we have adopted the provisions of this update as of january  and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  an update was made to intangibles goodwill and other 
this update is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by simplifying how an entity tests those assets for impairment and to improve consistency in impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
we have adopted the provisions of this update as of september  and due to the lack of indefinite lived intangible assets  there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards updates not yet effective in december  an update was made to property  plant  and equipment 
under the amendments in this update  when a parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary s nonrecourse debt  the reporting entity should apply the guidance in subtopic to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate 
the amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis and are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  we will adopt the provisions of this update in fiscal year and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  an update was made to balance sheet 
this update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
table of contents on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the disclosures required by this amendment will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods 
we will adopt the provisions of this update in fiscal year and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
trends due to regulatory environment sales by financial institutions of add on or ancillary products are the subject of increasing scrutiny by federal and state regulators  private plaintiffs and consumer groups 
for example  we believe that the federal cfpb and occ are reviewing our clients financial account policies and practices  their practices with respect to add on or ancillary products  and their management of third party suppliers like us 
the cfpb  occ and other regulatory agencies have entered into consent orders with financial institutions regarding the sales of add on products  including consent orders with our client capital one regarding the sale of payment protection products and our identity theft protection products during certain time periods 
under these consent orders financial institutions have agreed  among other things  to make restitution of fees collected from their customers  take other remedial actions  and cease marketing of the applicable products until their compliance plans are approved by regulators 
we expect that the regulators reviews of the sales of add on products by financial institutions will continue 
on july   we received a civil investigative demand a cid from the cfpb requesting production of documents and answers to questions regarding the provision of ancillary products related to credit card or deposit accounts 
the cfpb has not alleged a violation by us of any law or regulation 
we are in the process of responding to the cid 
certain state attorneys general also have brought enforcement actions against financial institutions regarding the sales of add on products 
we are not a party to those actions except for the matter described in item below  legal proceedings 
we or our financial institution clients could be the subject of further enforcement investigations or actions brought by the cfpb or other regulatory or law enforcement agencies 
responding to such investigations and actions may continue to cause us to incur material costs 
the effect of this combination of laws  regulations  reviews and proceedings is difficult to estimate  and any or a combination of them may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for example  financial institution clients have substantially reduced marketing of our products and services  and some financial institution clients have suspended billing of certain subscribers  and may suspend billing of or cancel other subscribers 
we believe these cancellations and suspensions are based on regulatory actions or changes in the regulatory environment 
as a result our revenue decreased in  and we expect our revenue and earnings to decrease in as compared to financial institution clients also may take remedial actions including the issuing of refunds  and may seek indemnification or contribution from us relating to those remedial actions

further  financial institutions have ceased or significantly decreased their marketing of add on or ancillary products  including our products  which we believe to be due at least in part to increased regulatory scrutiny of financial institution marketing of add on products 
as a result  our new subscriber additions were lower in as compared to we do not know whether the marketing of our products by those financial institutions will be resumed  or whether  if resumed  they will return to prior levels 
some financial institution clients also have suspended billing of certain subscribers  and may suspend billing of or cancel other subscribers

we are also required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants which include our consolidated leverage ratios  consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios  customary covenants  representations and warranties  funding conditions and events of default 
in addition  the amended credit agreement permits us to make share repurchases under announced stock repurchase programs  without lender consent  so long as the total amount repurchased does not exceed a specified maximum dollar amount and we maintain a minimum liquidity at the time of the repurchase we believe we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 

table of contents share repurchase in april  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we can repurchase our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining under our share repurchase program  all of which we are permitted to make under our amended credit agreement  without lender consent  in any fiscal year 
the repurchases may be made on the open market  in block trades  through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time

contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations at december  in thousands year ending december  total thereafter contractual obligations at december  capital leases  operating leases software license other arrangements includes interest expense and sales tax we did not enter into any capital leases in the year ended december  other arrangements include payments related to agreements to a service provider under which we receive data and other information for use in our new fraud protection services 
under these arrangements we pay based on usage of the data or analytics  and make certain minimum payments in exchange for defined limited exclusivity rights 
in january  we entered into a new contract with a credit reporting agency  in which we will make non refundable minimum payments totaling million and million in the years ending december  and  respectively 
the amounts in the table represent only the noncancelable portion of each respective arrangement 
in general  contracts can be terminated with day notice 
in addition to the obligations in the table above  approximately thousand of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with us gaap and we are uncertain as to when such amounts may be settled 
we may be subject to certain non income or indirect taxes in various state jurisdictions 
we are in the process of determining what obligations  if any  we have to these state taxing authorities 
it is not possible to 
table of contents predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the unique facts and circumstances involved 
to date  we have not been required to make any material payments 
without the benefit of an agreement with any state  we are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualiative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risks related to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is primarily related to our credit agreement  which is at a variable rate 
in addition to not having an outstanding balance under our credit agreement as of december   we also believe that a near term change in the benchmark interest rate would have an insignificant effect on our consolidated financial position 
foreign currency we have international sales in canada and  therefore  are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
we collect fees from subscriptions in canadian currency and pay a portion of the related expenses in canadian currency  which mitigates our exposure to currency exchange rate risk 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
during the year ended december   the us dollar has generally been weaker relative to the canadian dollar  which favorably impacted our results of operations as canadian dollars are translating into more us dollars 
fair value we may make certain withholding tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises 
these payments are directly impacted by the market price of our shares on the vesting or exercise date 
for the years ended december  and  payments for withholding tax upon vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises were million and million  respectively 
we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to our investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
