item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vishay intertechnology  inc is a global manufacturer and supplier of semiconductors and passive components  including power mosfets  power integrated circuits  transistors  diodes  optoelectronic components  resistors  capacitors  and inductors 
discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products  including those in the industrial  computing  automotive  consumer electronic products  telecommunications  power supplies  military aerospace  and medical industries 
on july   we completed the spin off of vishay precision group  inc vpg through a tax free stock dividend to our stockholders 
our common stockholders received share of vpg common stock for every shares of vishay common stock they held on the record date  june   and our class b common stockholders received share of vpg class b common stock for every shares of vishay class b common stock they held on the record date 
until july   vpg was part of vishay and its results of operations and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin off 
prior to the completion of the spin off of vpg  we operated in six product segments  mosfets  diodes  optoelectronic components  resistors inductors  capacitors  and vishay precision group 
following the spin off we operate in five product segments 
since  we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions 
through this strategy  we have grown to become one of the world largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components 
we expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure 
we are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share 
in addition to our growth plan  we also have opportunistically repurchased our stock 
in the second fiscal quarter of  we completed the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
including this most recent repurchase  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock since the fourth fiscal quarter of  representing of our shares outstanding before we began this initiative 
beginning in  the permitted capacity to repurchase shares of stock under our credit facility began to increase each quarter by an amount equal to of net income 
at december   our total capacity to repurchase shares of stock under our credit facility was million 
although we have no current plans  we will continue to evaluate attractive stock repurchase opportunities 
our business and operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions 
our revenues are dependent on end markets that are impacted by consumer and industrial demand  and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those global markets 
for several years  we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs 
we continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets that we serve 
additionally  we continue to closely monitor our costs  inventory  and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management  business processes  and resources to meet our future needs 
see additional information regarding our competitive strengths and key challenges as disclosed in part we utilize several financial metrics  including net revenues  gross profit margin  segment operating income  end of period backlog  book to bill ratio  inventory turnover  change in average selling prices  net cash and short term investments debt  and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
see further discussion in financial metrics and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources 
both and were characterized by stronger first halves and weaker second halves 
the first half of was stronger than the first half of  which resulted in a reduction of nearly all key financial metrics compared with the prior year 
net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  compared to net revenues of billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net earnings attributable to vishay stockholders for the year ended december  were million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings attributable to vishay stockholders of million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results of operations for the years ended december    and include items affecting comparability as listed in the reconciliation below 
the reconciliation below includes certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  including adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share 
these non gaap measures should not be viewed as an alternative to gaap measures of performance 
non gaap measures such as adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share do not have uniform definitions 
these measures  as calculated by vishay  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results 
reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding our intrinsic operations 
the items affecting comparability are in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  gaap net earnings attributable to vishay stockholders reconciling items affecting operating margin gain on sale of property executive compensation charges reconciling items affecting tax expense benefit tax effects of items above and other one time tax expense benefit adjusted net earnings adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding adjusted earnings per diluted share includes add back of interest on exchangeable notes in periods where the notes are dilutive 
our results for the year ended december  represent the effects of a deteriorating business environment in most of our markets that began in the third fiscal quarter of this period of business environment deterioration followed a period of improvement in the business environment experienced in the first six fiscal months of compared to the last six fiscal months of we believe that the business environment in most of our markets is being negatively impacted by macroeconomic anxiety that has started to influence the end consumers and the supply chain 
our results for demonstrate our ability to react quickly to changing economic environments and successfully implement temporary cost reduction measures when necessary to sustain earnings 
despite the relatively low revenues  our pre tax results were as we would expect based on our business model 
our results for the year ended december  were also affected by macroeconomic concerns  which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year 
this period of macroeconomic concern followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the global economic recession at the same sales volume 
our results for the year ended december  represent a period of favorable business conditions 
financial metrics we utilize several financial metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include net revenues  gross profit margin  operating margin  segment operating income  end of period backlog  and the book to bill ratio 
we also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices asp 
gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold  but also deducts certain other period costs  particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs 
losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge  but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used 
gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues  but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs 
operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
we evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin 
only dedicated  direct selling  general  and administrative expenses of the segments are included in the calculation of segment operating income 
segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs  asset write downs  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairments  inventory write downs  gain or losses on purchase commitments  global operations  sales and marketing  information systems  finance and administrative groups  and other items  expressed as a percentage of net revenues 
we believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment 
operating margin is clearly a function of net revenues  but also reflects our cost management programs and our ability to contain fixed costs 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future revenues 
we include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
an important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues 
we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory computed using each fiscal quarter end balance for this same period 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
pricing in our industry can be volatile 
we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing 
the erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products 
we attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions 
our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows net revenues  gross profit margin  operating income  end of period backlog  book to bill ratio  inventory turnover  and changes in asp for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of through the fourth fiscal quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter net revenues gross profit margin operating margin end of period backlog book to bill ratio inventory turnover change in asp vs

end of period backlog for the first fiscal quarter of reflects a total of million related to the backlog of hirel sytems llc as of the date of acquisition 
see financial metrics by segment below for net revenues  book to bill ratio  and gross profit margin broken out by segment 
like many of the companies in our industry  our results for the second half  and in particular  the fourth fiscal quarter  of were impacted by low demand from distributors which led to a further reduction in revenues compared to the prior fiscal quarters 
the low distributor demand  deteriorating business environment in most of our markets  and macroeconomic anxieties that affected end consumers and the supply chain has resulted in a decrease in the backlog 
the low distributor inventory levels in the supply chain and continued strength of the automotive market resulted in an increase in distributor orders and  as a result  the book to bill ratio  in the fourth fiscal quarter of competitive pricing pressure for commodity products has resulted in the continued decline of average selling prices versus the prior quarter and prior year periods 
lower sales volume led to a reduction in gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter versus the prior year period and the previous fiscal quarters 
due to the increase in orders  the book to bill ratio increased to in the fourth fiscal quarter of from in the third fiscal quarter of the book to bill ratios for distributors and original equipment manufacturers oem were and  respectively  versus ratios of and  respectively  during the third fiscal quarter of financial metrics by segment the following table shows net revenues  book to bill ratio  gross profit margin  and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of through the fourth fiscal quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter mosfets net revenues book to bill ratio gross profit margin segment operating margin diodes net revenues book to bill ratio gross profit margin segment operating margin optoelectronic components net revenues book to bill ratio gross profit margin segment operating margin resistors inductors net revenues book to bill ratio gross profit margin segment operating margin capacitors net revenues book to bill ratio gross profit margin segment operating margin acquisition and divestiture activity as part of our growth strategy  we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets  reputations for product quality and reliability  and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise 
this includes exploring opportunities to acquire targets to gain market share  penetrate different geographic markets  enhance new product development  round out our existing product lines  or grow our high margin niche market businesses 
acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier  acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies 
to limit our financial exposure  we have implemented a policy not to pursue acquisitions if our post acquisition debt would exceed x our pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
for these purposes  we calculate pro forma ebitda as the adjusted ebitda of vishay and the target for vishay four preceding fiscal quarters  with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period 
our growth plan targets adding  through acquisitions  an average of approximately million of revenues per year 
depending on the opportunities available  we might make several smaller acquisitions or a few larger acquisitions 
we intend to make such acquisitions using mainly cash  rather than debt or equity  although we do have capacity under our revolving credit facility if necessary 
we are not currently targeting acquisitions larger than million 
there is no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire additional suitable acquisition candidates at price levels and on terms and conditions we consider acceptable 
activities on january   we acquired hirel systems llc  a leading supplier of high reliability transformers  inductors  coils  and power conversion products  for approximately million 
the products and technology portfolio acquired will further enhance our inductors portfolio  particularly in the field of custom magnetics for medical  military  aerospace and aviation  and applications in the industrial and commercial field such as renewable energy and test and measurement equipment 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations for this business have been included in the resistors inductors segment from january  activities on september   we acquired the resistor businesses of huntington electric  inc  for approximately million 
the businesses acquired will further enhance our broad resistor portfolio  particularly in the high power and high current ranges  as well as with resistor assemblies for industrial applications 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations for these businesses have been included in the resistors inductors segment from september  spin off of vishay precision group  inc on july   we completed the spin off of our measurements and foil resistors businesses into an independent  publicly traded company named vishay precision group  inc through a tax free stock dividend to our stockholders 
our common stockholders received share of vpg common stock for every shares of vishay common stock they held on the record date  june   and our class b common stockholders received share of vpg class b common stock for every shares of vishay class b common stock they held on the record date 
upon completion of the spin off  certain executive officers received bonuses aggregating approximately million  which is reflected in the results for the year ended december  until july   vpg was part of vishay and its assets  liabilities  results of operations  and cash flows are included in the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the spin off 
the product lines that comprise vpg are included in the vpg reporting segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the effect that vpg had on our consolidated results 
cost management we place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs 
the erosion of average selling prices of established products  particularly our semiconductor products  that is typical of our industry and inflation drive us to continually seek ways to reduce our variable costs 
our variable cost reduction efforts include expending capital to increase automation and maximize the efficiency in our production facilities  consolidating materials purchasing across regions and divisions to achieve economies of scale  materials substitution  maintaining an appropriate mix of in house production and subcontractor production  increasing wafer size and shrinking dies to maximize efficiency in our semiconductor production processes  and other yield improvement activities 
our cost management strategy also includes a focus on controlling fixed costs 
we seek to maintain selling  general  and administrative expenses at current quarterly levels  excluding foreign currency exchange effects and substantially independent of sales volume changes 
our fixed cost control efforts include automating administrative processes through the expansion of it systems  gradually migrating to common it systems across our organization  streamlining our legal entity structure  and reducing our external resource needs by utilizing more cost effective in house personnel  while utilizing external resources when day to day expertise is not required in house 
historically  our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high labor cost countries  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost countries  such as the czech republic  israel  india  malaysia  mexico  the people republic of china  and the philippines 
between and  we recorded  in the consolidated statements of operations  restructuring and severance costs totaling million and related asset write downs totaling million in order to reduce our cost structure going forward 
we also incurred significant costs to restructure and integrate acquired businesses  which was included in the cost of the acquisitions under then applicable gaap 
we believe that our workforce is now appropriately located to serve our customers  while maintaining lower manufacturing costs 
we did not initiate any new restructuring projects in and thus did not record any restructuring and severance expenses during such periods 
because we believe that our manufacturing footprint is suitable to serve our customers and end markets  we do not anticipate any material restructuring expenses in we currently plan to keep our trained workforce even at lower manufacturing activity levels by reducing hours and limiting the use of subcontractors and foundries 
however  the recurrence of a significant economic downturn may require us to implement additional restructuring initiatives 
our long term strategy includes growth through the integration of acquired businesses  and gaap requires plant closure and employee termination costs that we incur in connection with our acquisition activities to be recorded as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations  as such expenses are incurred 
we have not incurred any material plant closure or employee termination costs related to our acquisitions of huntington electric and hirel systems  llc  but we expect to have some level of future restructuring expenses due to acquisitions 
even as we seek to manage our costs  we continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines  and through increasing our resources for r d  technical marketing  and field application engineering  supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses 
growth plan we are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share by growing our business and opportunistically repurchasing our stock 
we plan to grow our business through intensified internal growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions  while at the same time maintaining a prudent capital structure 
to foster intensified internal growth  we have increased our r d and engineering technical staff by since and plan to further increase it  we are expanding critical manufacturing capacities  and we are increasing our technical field sales force in asia by about to increase the design in of our products in local markets 
our growth plan also targets adding  through acquisitions  million of revenues per year on average 
since  we have acquired the specialty product businesses of huntington electric and hirel systems  llc and we continue to explore additional acquisition opportunities despite the current economic volatility 
foreign currency translation we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
while we have in the past used forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our projected cash flows from these exposures  we generally have not done so in recent periods 
gaap requires that entities identify the functional currency of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency 
a subsidiary functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
in cases where a subsidiary is relatively self contained within a particular country  the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency 
however  a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company operations generally would have the parent company currency as its functional currency 
we have both situations among our subsidiaries 
foreign subsidiaries which use the local currency as the functional currency we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies  and accordingly  these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency 
for those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
for those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency  revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year 
while the translation of revenues and expenses into us dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations  the translation effectively increases or decreases the us dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies 
the dollar generally was stronger in the year ended december  compared to the prior year  with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into us dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the comparable prior year periods 
these subsidiaries incur gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency  especially in periods of rapidly changing foreign currency exchange rates 
the sudden rapid changes in the euro exchange rates experienced in resulted in modest transactional losses 
foreign subsidiaries which use the us dollar as the functional currency our operations in israel and most significant locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  and accordingly  these subsidiaries utilize the us dollar as their functional currency 
for those foreign subsidiaries where the us dollar is the functional currency  all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into us dollars 
exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations 
while these subsidiaries transact most business in us dollars  they may have significant costs  particularly payroll related  which are incurred in the local currency 
the cost of products sold and selling  general  and administrative expense for the year ended december  have been slightly favorably impacted compared to the prior year by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
see item a for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange risk 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return 
we have modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant at our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after the sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to reasonably estimate future credits under the programs 
recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions  with input from sales and marketing personnel and review  assessment  and  if necessary  adjustment by corporate management 
while our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences  all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant  such as sales to distributors during the relevant period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
in our judgment  the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals 
we do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates 
we recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied  the amount is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property 
the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by our management that we believe are reasonable 
however  it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
inventories and purchase commitments we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for work in process goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets  and can be subject to significant price volatility 
our policy is to enter into short term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget 
we record losses and related liabilities when the contractually obligated purchase price under our purchase commitments exceed quoted market prices for the metals 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
these impairment tests must be performed more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
when testing goodwill for impairment  we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the two step quantitative impairment test 
if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test is not required 
if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test is required 
in the first step of the quantitative impairment test  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques  including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis an income approach 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are generally the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance graph in item of our annual report on form k 
in step two of the quantitative impairment test  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if we had acquired those business units 
specifically  we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the book value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill computed in step two 
fair value of reporting units  and the underlying assets and liabilities of those reporting units  is measured at a point in time  and reflects specific market conditions as of the measurement date 
we perform our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  completed technology  tradenames  in process research and development  customer relationships  and certain property and equipment valued at replacement costs 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual financial results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and tradenames  including property and equipment  long term prepaid assets  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and evaluated as a group 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets  changes in historical or projected operating performance  and significant negative economic trends 
the carrying value of a long lived asset group is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset group  primarily determined using discounted future cash flows 
indefinite lived intangible assets which for us are comprised entirely of tradenames are not amortized  but similar to goodwill  are tested for impairment at least annually 
these tests are performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
when testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired  we would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the tradenames is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such tradenames and not having to pay a royalty for their use 
the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets  and the determination of their fair value  requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the principal asset of the group  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures 
the evaluation of the fair value of indefinite lived trademarks also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the assumed market royalty rate  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group carrying value is recoverable  that an indefinite lived asset is not impaired  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across many countries and industries  we have limited exposure to concentrations of credit risk 
as of december   one customer comprised of our accounts receivable balance 
this customer comprised of our accounts receivable balance as of december  no other customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance as of december  or december  we continually monitor the credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for uncollectible accounts accordingly 
we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates 
the discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  estimated mortality  and for certain postretirement medical plans  increases or trends in health care costs 
management reviews these assumptions at least annually 
we use independent actuaries and investment advisers to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates 
these assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate 
our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the united states  germany  and the republic of china taiwan 
plans in these countries comprise approximately of our retirement obligations at december  in the us  we utilize published long term high quality bonds to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
in germany and the republic of china taiwan  we utilize published long term government bond rates to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
we utilize bond yields at various maturity dates that reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments 
we believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled 
within the us  we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk 
many of our non us plans are unfunded based on local laws and customs 
for those non us plans that do maintain investments  their asset holdings are primarily cash and fixed income securities  based on local laws and customs 
we set the expected long term rate of return based on the expected long term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios 
in establishing this rate  we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested  advice from pension consultants and investment advisors  and current economic and capital market conditions 
the expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset losses gains affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
we expect net periodic pension cost in to approximate net period pension cost recognized in  with an increase in the amortization of unrecognized losses offset by lower interest cost due to lower discount rates 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we adopted amendments to our principal us defined benefit pension plans  such that effective january   the plans were frozen 
pursuant to these amendments  no new employees may participate in the plans  no further participant contributions will be required or permitted  and no further benefits shall accrue after december  accordingly  net periodic pension cost for us plans no longer include any service cost 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expenses are appropriate 
however  if economic conditions change or if our investment strategy changes  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances and the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
these accruals are based on management best estimate of potential tax exposures 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
we and our subsidiaries file us federal income tax returns  as well as income tax returns in multiple us state and foreign jurisdictions 
the us internal revenue service concluded its examinations of our us federal tax returns for all tax years through because of net operating losses  which were fully utilized on the tax return  our us federal tax return for and subsequent years remain subject to examination 
examinations of most principal subsidiaries in israel through the tax year were concluded in  and these principal subsidiaries are currently under audit for tax years through the tax returns of other significant non us subsidiaries are currently under examination in germany through  india through  china through  and the republic of china taiwan through 
we and our subsidiaries are also subject to income taxes in other taxing jurisdictions in the us and around the world  many of which are still open to examinations 
we account for uncertainty in income tax positions using the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements as prescribed in gaap 
for a tax benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
we have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits  but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
substantially all earnings generated by our non us subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested outside of the united states indefinitely 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us federal and state income taxes on these foreign earnings 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits  state income taxes  incremental foreign income taxes  and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
additional information about income taxes is included in note to our consolidated financial statements

change attributable to decrease in volume change in average selling prices foreign currency effects acquisitions absence of vpg other net change our revenue results for the year ended december  were negatively affected by the reduced demand for our products that we began to experience in the last six fiscal months of  which significantly reduced our backlog  and the deterioration of the business environment of most of our markets in the last six fiscal months of following an improving business environment in the first six fiscal months of our cost management and the adaptation of our manufacturing capacities enabled us to sustain earnings at the lower sales volume 
our revenue results for the year ended december  represent the effects of macroeconomic concerns  which reduced demand for our products in the last six fiscal months of the year  and the resulting quick adaptation of our manufacturing capacities in response thereto 
this period of macroeconomic concerns followed a period of favorable business conditions through the first six fiscal months of the year in which we achieved significantly higher annualized earnings than before the beginning of the global economic recession at the same sales volume 
the recovery of our business and revenues that we began experiencing in the second half of continued throughout due to historically high overall demand for electronic components and a favorable pricing environment 
we deduct  from the sales that we record to distributors  allowances for future credits that we expect to provide for returns  scrapped product  and price adjustments under various programs made available to the distributors 
we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively  or  as a percentage of gross sales    and  respectively 
actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then current business climate

the decrease in gross profit margin from to is primarily due to decreases in sales volume and average selling prices 
also  a non recurring manufacturing issue associated with purchased materials affected the results 
the mosfets segment was the segment most adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods and the reduction in distribution orders in the second half of the decrease in gross profit margin from to reflects significantly lower volume and average selling prices from the historically high prices of we have experienced a significant decline in average selling prices versus the prior years 
the decline in is partially due to selective volume based pricing for our mosfets products that we implemented in the second fiscal quarter of customer qualification of next generation high voltage mosfets is currently on going 
these new and innovative products have received a good reception by the market thus far 
we continue to make capital and r d investments in this business 
accordingly  while the current environment is challenging  we are optimistic about the long term prospects of the mosfets segment

the segment gross profit margin remained high despite a decrease in sales volume and average selling prices in the optoelectronic components segment was adversely affected by the decreased demand for consumer goods in the second half of  but benefited from strong demand from the automotive and industrial markets 
despite some fluctuations in demand  gross profit margin remained relatively steady in the slight decrease in gross profit margin versus is primarily due to a reduction from historically high average selling prices versus the prior periods

the segment gross profit margin remained high  but decreased slightly from to due to decreases in sales volume 
the resistors inductors segment was adversely affected by the economic slowdown in the second half of  but continued to produce strong results 
the decrease in gross profit margin from to is primarily due to a slight decrease in volume 
we further enhanced the segment product portfolio in by acquiring hirel systems 
specifically  hirel systems expands our magnetic and power conversion specialty product portfolio 
the integration of huntington electric  acquired in the third fiscal quarter of  and hirel systems continues as planned 
our results for were positively impacted by the acquisitions of huntington electric and hirel systems and we expect hirel systems revenue growth to out perform our corporate average 
more opportunities for acquisitions exist and are being evaluated 
average selling prices declined slightly from to partially due to unfavorable customer mix

the decrease in gross profit margin from to is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and some temporary inefficiencies 
the capacitors segment was adversely affected by high distributor inventory levels in the second half of the increase in gross profit margin from to is primarily due to increased average selling prices  which more than offset the lower volume 
average selling prices have remained relatively stable  substantially higher than vishay precision group we completed the spin off of vpg on july  net revenues and gross margin percentage for the periods that vpg was included in our consolidated results were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net revenues gross margin percentage selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses are summarized as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  total sg a expenses as a percentage of sales the overall decrease in sg a expenses in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  is primarily attributable to cost containment initiatives and certain temporary cost reduction programs  lower bonus accruals for  and a positive exchange rate impact  partially offset by sg a expenses of acquired businesses 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues 
vpg accounted for million including million of costs associated with the spin off of sg a expenses for the year ended december  the overall increase in sg a expenses  excluding vpg  in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  is primarily attributable to foreign currency effects 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in revenues 
several items included in sg a expenses impact the comparability of these amounts  as summarized below in thousands years ended december  amortization of intangible assets net losses gains on sales of assets costs associated with vpg spin off the acquisitions of the resistor businesses of huntington electric in the third fiscal quarter of and hirel systems llc in the first fiscal quarter of increased our amortizable intangible assets balance by million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for an estimate of our annual amortization expense through additional acquisition activity will increase these amounts 
amortization expense remained stable in versus principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized  which was offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the aforementioned acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of and first fiscal quarter of the decrease in amortization expense in versus is principally due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized  partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the aforementioned acquisition of the resistor businesses of huntington electric in the third fiscal quarter of we also recorded a million gain on the sale of vacated property in belgium in the second fiscal quarter of that is reported on a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  other income expense compared to interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million versus the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due and due that were issued on may  and may   respectively

the increase in interest income in is primarily due to the interest earned on the short term investments purchased in the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  is primarily due to lower interest rates on the short term investments in versus compared to interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million versus the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to interest on convertible senior debentures due and due that were issued on november  and may   respectively 
the following table analyzes the components of the line other on the consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange gain loss interest income loss on early extinguishment of debt sale of investments other in the year ended december   we recorded a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt equal to the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with a revolving credit commitment and term loan at the date of termination 
the increase in interest income in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  is primarily due to the interest earned on the short term investments purchased in income taxes for the years ended december    and  the effective tax rates were   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates are less than the us statutory rate primarily because of earnings in foreign jurisdictions and the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
income tax expense for the years ended december    and include certain discrete tax items for changes in uncertain tax positions  valuation allowances  tax rates  and other related items 
these items total million tax benefit  million  and million tax benefit in   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the discrete item is the reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in israel due to a merger of several of our wholly owned subsidiaries in israel in the fourth fiscal quarter which will allow for the realization of these tax benefits that likely otherwise would have been forgone 
for the year ended december   the discrete items included a million expense for the effect of a tax rate change on deferred taxes in israel recorded in the first fiscal quarter  reduced by million for a tax return filing in the fourth fiscal quarter  and partially offset by benefits related to reductions of valuation allowances in various jurisdictions of million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the reductions of valuation allowances were principally in belgium due to expected future income from a pending real estate sale 
the discrete items for the year ended december  were recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter and related primarily to the release of valuation allowances in the us and israel 
we operate in a global environment with significant operations in various locations outside the united states 
accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our earnings and the applicable tax rates in the various locations where we operate 
part of our strategy is to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government sponsored incentives 
accordingly  our effective tax rate is generally less than the us statutory tax rate 
changes in the effective tax rate are largely attributable to changes in the mix of pretax income among our various taxing jurisdictions 
additional information about income taxes is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources we focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
the cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans  and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy and to reduce debt levels 
we have generated cash flows from operations in excess of million in each of the past years  and cash flows from operations in excess of million in each of the past years 
a portion of the cash flows from operations was generated by vpg which was spun off on july  we refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash  a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions  repay debt  and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends 
vishay has generated positive free cash in each of the past years  and free cash in excess of million in each of the past years 
in this volatile economic environment  we continue to focus on the generation of free cash  including an emphasis on cost controls 
we continued to generate positive cash flows from operations and free cash in line with our history despite the difficult economic environment during the year ended december  there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to continue to generate cash flows from operations and free cash at the same levels  or at all  going forward if the current economic environment worsens 
beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we reacted to favorable market conditions to significantly reshape the company capital structure 
these initiatives continued in on may   we completed the offering of million principal amount of convertible senior debentures due to qualified institutional investors 
we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with cash on hand  to repurchase  shares of common stock at per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we believe that the use of low coupon  long dated convertible debentures was a more efficient means to finance the repurchase versus repatriation of non us cash 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
including the most recent issuance of convertible debentures described above  we have completed three issuances of low coupon convertible debentures since the fourth fiscal quarter of  each of which matures thirty years from the date of issuance 
we utilized the proceeds of those debenture offerings to repurchase million shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our outstanding stock prior to implementing these initiatives 
substantially all of our december  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances were held by our non us subsidiaries 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we repatriated million of cash to the us  which substantially completed the million cash repatriation program we initiated in this repatriated cash was used to reduce the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
following this reduction in the amount outstanding under the facility  the carrying value of our long term debt is approximately the same as the carrying value of debt prior to the may issuance of the convertible debentures due the tax effect of this repatriation was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of at the present time  we expect the remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested outside of the united states indefinitely 
if additional cash is needed to be repatriated to the united states  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits  state income taxes  incremental foreign income taxes  and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we also entered into a new  larger  revolving credit facility in december  which has been favorably amended at minimal cost 
on april   we amended our credit agreement and entered into an incremental facility agreement that increases the total revolving commitment from million to million 
the incremental commitments provide us with additional flexibility to pursue our growth plan 
the incremental revolving commitments have terms and conditions identical to the terms and conditions of the existing commitments under the credit facility 
other significant terms and conditions of the credit agreement have not been changed 
following the expansion  we have the ability to request up to an additional million of incremental commitments  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility provides a revolving commitment through december  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus an interest margin 
the applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio 
based on our current leverage ratio  borrowings bear interest at libor plus 
the interest rate on our borrowings will increase if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds to and will decrease if our leverage ratio decreases below to we are also required to pay facility commitment fees of per annum on the entire commitment amount 
such facility commitment fees will increase if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds to the borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all assets located in the united states  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and general intangibles but excluding real estate  intellectual property registered or licensed for use in  or arising under the laws of  any country other than the united states  and bank and securities accounts of vishay and certain significant domestic subsidiaries  and pledges of stock in certain significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain significant subsidiaries 
certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility  subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions 
any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by vishay 
the credit facility includes limits or restrictions on  among other things  incurring indebtedness  incurring liens on assets  making investments and acquisitions  making asset sales  repurchasing our common stock  and paying cash dividends and making other restricted payments 
the credit facility also requires us to comply with other covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
the financial maintenance covenants include a an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than to  and b a leverage ratio of not more than to and a pro forma ratio of to on the date of incurrence of additional debt 
the computation of these ratios is prescribed in article of the credit agreement between vishay intertechnology  inc and jpmorgan chase bank  na  which has been filed with the sec as exhibit to our current report on form k filed december  we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility at december  our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were to and to  respectively 
we expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections 
if we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants  the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders  and all amounts outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable 
additionally  our exchangeable unsecured notes due and our convertible senior debentures due  due  and due have cross default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated 
beginning in  our permitted capacity to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under the credit facility began to increase each quarter by an amount equal to of net income 
at december   our credit facility allowed us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
the amount and timing of any future stock repurchases remains subject to authorization of our board of directors 
in  we began investing a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid  high quality instruments with maturities greater than days  but less than year  which we classify as short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
as these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy  we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short term investments debt 
at december   the interest rates on our short term investments average and are approximately basis points higher than interest rates on our cash accounts 
transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the following table summarizes the components of net cash and short term investments debt at december  and  respectively in thousands december  december  credit facility exchangeable unsecured notes  due convertible senior debentures  due convertible senior debentures  due convertible senior debentures  due total debt cash and cash equivalents short term investments net cash and short term investments debt represents the carrying amount of the convertible debentures  which is comprised of the principal amount of the debentures  net of the unamortized discount and the associated embedded derivative liability 
measurements such as free cash and net cash and short term investments debt do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with gaap 
such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to gaap measures of performance or liquidity 
however  management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions  repay debt  and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends  and that an analysis of net cash and short term investments debt assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management 
these measures  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the balance of our revolving credit facility was million at december  we borrowed million and repaid million on our credit facility during the year ended december  the average outstanding balance on our credit facility calculated at fiscal month ends was million and the highest amount outstanding on our credit facility at a month end was million during the year ended december  management expects to continue to maintain the outstanding balance on the credit facility around its current level  and may periodically pay down the balance with available cash or use the credit facility to meet short term financing needs 
we expect that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer term financing needs related to normal operating requirements and our research and development and capital expenditure plans 
acquisition activity or share repurchases may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt 
our financial condition as of december  continued to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  as compared to to as of december  the slight increase is primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and other accrued expenses in our ratio of total debt to vishay stockholders equity was to at december  as compared to a ratio of to at december  this slight decrease is primarily due to the net repayment of million on our credit facility in partially offset by the carrying amount of the convertible senior debentures due issued in the second fiscal quarter of cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to cash flows provided by operations of million for the year ended december  this decrease is principally due to million less net earnings generated in  partially offset by changes in working capital 
cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect capital spending of approximately million in contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period total years years more than year long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating and capital leases letters of credit expected pension and postretirement plan funding estimated costs to complete construction in progress uncertain tax positions purchase commitments other long term liabilities executive employment agreement total contractual cash obligations commitments for long term debt are based on the amount required to settle the obligation 
accordingly  the discounts associated with our convertible debentures due  due  and due are excluded from the calculation of long term debt commitments in the table above 
commitments for interest payments on long term debt are cash commitments based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement  one of which bears a maturity date of  and include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility  which expires on december  commitments for interest payments on long term debt exclude non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount associated with our convertible debentures due  due  and due various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future principal and interest payments 
among other things  approximately million of our outstanding debt instruments are convertible into or exchangeable for common stock at the option of the holder 
also  although we intend to net share settle our convertible senior debentures due  due  and due  we have the option to settle these instruments in shares of common stock pursuant to the indenture governing these debentures 
additionally  interest commitments for our variable rate exchangeable notes due and revolving credit facility are based on the rate prevailing at december   but actual rates are variable and are certain to change over time 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in multiple taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we expect to pay million of the liabilities in due to the settlement of tax audits 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
accordingly  the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years  although actual timing of payments may be sooner 
there are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among vishay and vpg in accordance with the terms of the master separation and distribution agreement and the tax matters agreement 
the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax matters agreement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax matters agreement 
these obligations were not material to us as of december   and are included in the uncertain tax positions disclosed above 
we maintain long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity for our semiconductor products 
the purchase commitments in the table above represent the estimated minimum commitments for silicon wafers under these agreements and include commitments that arose subsequent to the balance sheet date due to amendments to the agreements 
our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments 
gaap requires that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market prices 
the purchase commitments for silicon wafers described above are for the manufacture of proprietary products using vishay siliconix owned technology licensed to these subcontractors by siliconix  and accordingly  management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments 
management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices 
other long term liabilities in the table above include obligations that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and known obligations that arose subsequent to the balance sheet date 
other long term liabilities for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement are classified as payments due after five years in the table above  although actual timing of payments may be sooner 
as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on may   we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with the late dr 
felix zandman  our founder and former executive chairman  chief technical and business development officer 
pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement  dr 
zandman received million upon signing the agreement and five additional annual payments of million each  two of which remain to be paid to his estate as of december  dr 
zandman passing in june had no effect on the timing of these payments 
for a further discussion of our long term debt  pensions and other postretirement benefits  leases  uncertain tax positions  executive employment agreements  and purchase commitments  see notes    and to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than the operating leases described above 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
see also commodity price risk included in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional related information 
recent accounting pronouncements as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  new accounting guidance became effective for us in there is no effective accounting guidance pending adoption as of december  that is expected to have a material effect on our future financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
the adoption of the new guidance in note to our consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure we are exposed to certain financial risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
on a selective basis  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt 
as of december    and we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap or cap agreements 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our exchangeable notes due the exchangeable notes  of which million are outstanding  bear interest at libor reset quarterly 
the interest paid on our credit facility is based on a libor spread 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the present amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment bears interest at libor plus 
our convertible senior debentures due  due  and due bear interest at a fixed rate  and accordingly are not subject to interest rate fluctuation risks 
at december   we have million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments  which earn interest at various variable rates 
based on the debt and cash positions at december   we would expect a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt 
also see economic outlook and impact on operations and future financial results included in item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of market risks 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
from time to time  we utilize forward contracts to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  israel  and asia 
we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies 
our operations in israel and most significant locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in israel  the czech republic  and china because the percentage of expenses denominated in israeli shekels  czech koruna  and chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in israeli shekels  czech koruna  and chinese renminbi to total sales 
therefore  if the israeli shekel  czech koruna  and chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have a higher percentage of euro denominated sales than expenses 
therefore  when the euro strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies  our operating profit is increased 
accordingly  we monitor several important cross rates 
we have performed sensitivity analyses as of december  and  using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at december  and the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  although individual line items in our consolidated statement of operations would be materially affected 
for example  a weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the us dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies  which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in us dollars or have the us dollar as their functional currency 
a change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar  particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time 
commodity price risk although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers or are subject to significant price volatility 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price changes for these raw materials 
the determination that any of the raw materials used in our products are conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could increase the probability that we will encounter the challenges noted above  incur additional expenses to comply with government regulations  and face public scrutiny 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices 
silicon wafers are the most important raw material for the manufacturing of our semiconductor products 
silicon wafers are manufactured from high purity silicon  a metalloid 
there have at times been industry wide shortages of high purity silicon resulting primarily from growing demand of the electronic component and solar power industries  and limited growth in high purity silicon manufacturing capacities 
shifts in demand for high purity silicon and in turn  silicon wafers  have resulted in significant fluctuation in prices of silicon wafers 
we are a major consumer of the world annual production of tantalum  a metal used in the manufacturing of tantalum capacitors 
there are few suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we acquire tantalum powder and wire from all of them under short term commitments 
palladium  a metal used to produce multi layer ceramic capacitors  is currently found primarily in south africa and russia 
palladium is a commodity metal that is subject to price volatility 
we periodically enter into short term commitments to purchase palladium 
certain metals used in the manufacture of our products  such as copper  are traded on active markets  and can be subject to significant price volatility 
our policy is to enter into short term commitments to purchase defined portions of annual consumption of these metals if market prices decline below budget 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by million  assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices
