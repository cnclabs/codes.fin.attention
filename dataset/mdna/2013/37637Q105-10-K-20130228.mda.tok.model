the company actively solicits residential real estate loan applications from real estate brokers  contractors  existing customers  customer referrals  and on line applications 
the company s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ratio on residential mortgage loans to percent of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price 
policies allow the loan to value to be above percent of the loan when insured by a private mortgage insurance company 
the company also provides interim construction financing for single family dwellings 
these loans are supported by a term take out commitment 
consumer land or lot loans the company originates land and lot acquisition loans to borrowers who intend to construct their primary residence on the respective land or lot 
these loans are generally for a term of three to five years and are secured by the developed land or lot with the loan to value limited to the lesser of percent of the appraised value or percent of the cost 

table of contents unimproved land and land development loans although unimproved land and land development loans have not been originated in the past four years  where real estate market conditions warrant  the company may originate such loans on properties intended for residential and commercial use 
these loans are generally made for a term of months to two years and secured by the developed property with a loan to value not to exceed the lesser of percent of cost or percent of the appraised discounted bulk sale value upon completion of the improvements 
the projects under development are inspected on a regular basis and advances are made on a percentage of completion basis 
the loans are made to borrowers with real estate development experience and appropriate financial strength 
generally  the company requires that a certain percentage of the development be pre sold or that construction and term take out commitments are in place prior to funding the loan 
loans made on unimproved land are generally made for a term of five to ten years with a loan to value not to exceed the lesser of percent of appraised value or percent of cost 
residential builder guidance lines the company provides builder guidance lines that are comprised of pre sold and spec home construction and lot acquisition loans 
the spec home construction and lot acquisition loans are limited to a specific number and maximum amount 
generally  the individual loans will not exceed a one year maturity 
the homes under construction are inspected on a regular basis and advances made on a percentage of completion basis 
commercial real estate loans loans are made to purchase  construct and finance commercial real estate properties 
these loans are generally made to borrowers who own and will occupy the property and generally have a loan to value up to the lesser of percent of the appraised value or percent of the cost and require a minimum times debt service coverage margin 
loans to finance investment or income properties are made  but require additional equity and generally have a loan to value up to the lesser of percent of appraised value or percent of cost and require a higher debt service coverage margin commensurate with the specific property and projected income 
consumer lending the majority of consumer loans are secured by real estate  automobiles  or other assets 
the company intends to continue making such loans because of their short term nature  generally between three months and five years 
moreover  interest rates on consumer loans are generally higher than on residential mortgage loans 
the company also originates second mortgage and home equity loans  especially to existing customers in instances where the first and second mortgage loans are less than percent of the current appraised value of the property 
home equity loans the company million of home equity loans as of december  consist of family junior lien mortgages and first and junior lien lines of credit secured by residential real estate 
the home equity loan portfolio consists of percent variable interest rate and percent fixed interest rate loans 
approximately percent of the home equity loans are in a first lien status with the remaining percent in junior lien status 
approximately percent of the home equity loans are closed end amortizing loans and percent are open end  revolving home equity lines of credit 
home equity lines of credit are generally originated with maturity terms from to years 
at origination  borrowers can choose a variable interest rate or fixed interest rate for the full term of the line of credit  or a fixed interest rate for the first or years from origination which then converts to a variable interest rate for the remaining term of the home equity lines of credit 
the draw period usually exists from origination to the maturity of the home equity lines of credit 
during the draw period  a borrower with a variable interest rate term has the option of converting to a fixed interest rate for all or a portion of the remaining term to maturity 
during the draw period  the company has home equity lines of credit where the borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest 
credit risk management the company is committed to a conservative management of the credit risk within the loan portfolio  including the early recognition of problem loans 
the company s credit risk management includes stringent credit policies  individual loan approval limits  limits on concentrations of credit  and committee approval of larger loan requests 
management practices also include regular internal and external credit examinations  identification and review of individual loans and leases experiencing deterioration of credit quality  procedures for the collection of non performing assets  quarterly monitoring of the loan portfolio  semi annual review of loans by industry  and periodic stress testing of the loans secured by real estate 
federal and state regulatory safety and soundness examinations are conducted annually 

table of contents the company s loan policy and credit administration practices establish standards and limits for all extensions of credit that are secured by interests in or liens on real estate  or made for the purpose of financing the construction of real property or other improvements 
ongoing monitoring and review of the loan portfolio is based on current information  including the borrowers and guarantors creditworthiness  value of the real estate and other collateral  the project s performance against projections  and monthly inspections by employees or external parties until the real estate project is complete 
monitoring of the junior lien and home equity lines of credit portfolios includes evaluating payment delinquency  collateral values  bankruptcy notices and foreclosure filings 
additionally  the company places junior lien mortgages and junior lien home equity lines of credit on non accrual status when there is evidence that the associated senior lien is days past due or is in the process of foreclosure  regardless of the junior lien delinquency status 
loan approval limits individual loan approval limits have been established for each lender based on the loan types and experience of the individual 
each bank division has an officer loan committee consisting of senior lenders and members of senior management 
the bank divisions officer loan committees have loan approval authority between  and  the bank divisions advisory boards have loan approval authority up to  loans exceeding these limits and up to  are subject to approval by the company s executive loan committee consisting of the bank divisions senior loan officers and the company s credit administrator 
loans greater than  are subject to approval by the bank s board of directors 
under banking laws  loans to one borrower and related entities are limited to a prescribed percentage of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the bank 
interest reserves interest reserves are used to periodically advance loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the related loan 
as with any extension of credit  the decision to establish a loan funded interest reserve upon origination of construction loans  including residential construction and land  lot and other construction loans  is based on prudent underwriting  including the feasibility of the project  expected cash flow  creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors  and the protection provided by the real estate and other underlying collateral 
interest reserves provide an effective means for addressing the cash flow characteristics of construction loans 
in response to the downturn in the housing market and potential impact upon construction lending  the company discourages the creation or continued use of interest reserves 
interest reserves are advanced provided the related construction loan is performing as expected 
loans with interest reserves may be extended  renewed or restructured only when the related loan continues to perform as expected and meets the prudent underwriting standards identified above 
such renewals  extension or restructuring are not permitted in order to keep the related loan current 
in monitoring the performance and credit quality of a construction loan  the company assesses the adequacy of any remaining interest reserve  and whether the use of an interest reserve remains appropriate in the presence of emerging weakness and associated risks in the construction loan 
the ongoing accrual and recognition of uncollected interest as income continues only when facts and circumstances continue to reasonably support the contractual payment of principal or interest 
loans are typically designated as non accrual when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely and has remained unpaid for ninety days or more 
for such loans  the accrual of interest and its capitalization into the loan balance will be discontinued 
the company had million and million in loans with interest reserves with remaining reserves of thousand and thousand as of december  and  respectively 
during  the company extended  renewed  or restructured loans with interest reserves  such loans having an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million as of december  however  such actions were based on prudent underwriting standards and not to keep the loans current 
as of december   the company had construction loans totaling million with interest reserves that are currently non performing or which are potential problem loans 

table of contents loan purchases and sales fixed rate  long term mortgage loans are generally sold in the secondary market 
the company is active in the secondary market  primarily through the origination of conventional  fha and va residential mortgages 
the sale of loans in the secondary mortgage market reduces the company s risk of holding long term  fixed rate loans during periods of rising rates 
in connection with conventional loan sales  the company typically sells the majority of mortgage loans originated with servicing released 
the company has also been very active in generating commercial sba loans  and other commercial loans  with a portion of those loans sold to investors 
the company has not originated any type of subprime mortgages  either for the loan portfolio or for sale to investors 
in addition  the company has not purchased securities that were collateralized with subprime mortgages 
the company has not purchased loans outside the company or originated loans outside the company s geographic market area 
loan origination and other fees in addition to interest earned on loans  the company receives fees for originating loans 
loan fees generally are a percentage of the principal amount of the loan and are charged to the borrower  and are normally deducted from the proceeds of the loan 
loan origination fees are generally percent to percent on residential mortgages and percent to percent on commercial loans 
consumer loans require a fixed fee amount as well as a minimum interest amount 
the company also receives other fees and charges relating to existing loans  which include charges and fees collected in connection with loan modifications 
appraisal and evaluation process the company s loan policy and credit administration practices have adopted and implemented the applicable requirements of the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines and the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies in appendix a to part of title  cfr collectively  the guidelines and the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice uspap as established and amended by the appraisal standards board 
the company s loan policy establishes criteria for obtaining appraisals or evaluations new or updated  including transactions that are otherwise exempt from the appraisal requirements set forth within the guidelines 
each of the company s bank divisions monitor conditions  including supply and demand factors  in the real estate markets served so they can react quickly to changing market conditions to mitigate potential losses from specific credit exposures within the loan portfolio 
evidence of the following real estate market conditions and trends is obtained from lending personnel and third party sources demographic indicators  including employment and population trends  foreclosures  vacancy  construction and absorption rates  property sales prices  rental rates  and lease terms  current tax assessments  economic indicators  including trends within the lending areas  and valuation trends  including discount and capitalization rates 
third party information sources include federal  state  and local governments and agencies thereof  private sector economic data vendors  real estate brokers  licensed agents  sales  rental and foreclosure data tracking services 
the time between ordering an appraisal or evaluation and receipt from third party vendors is typically two to three weeks for residential property and four to six weeks for non residential property 
for real estate properties that are of highly specialized or limited use  significantly complex or large  additional time beyond the typical times may be required for new appraisals or evaluations new or updated 
as part of the company s credit administration and portfolio monitoring practices  the company s regular internal and external credit examinations review a significant number of individual loan files 
appraisals and evaluations new or updated are reviewed to determine whether the timeliness  methods  assumptions  and findings are reasonable and in compliance with the company s loan policy and credit administration practices  the guidelines and uspap standards 
such reviews include the adequacy of the steps taken by the company to ensure that the individuals who perform appraisals and evaluations new or updated are appropriately qualified and are not subject to conflicts of interest 
if there are any deficiencies noted in the reviews  they are reported to the bank board of directors and prompt corrective action is taken 

table of contents non performing assets the following table summarizes information regarding non performing assets at the dates indicated at or for the years ended dollars in thousands december  december  december  december  december  other real estate owned accruing loans days or more past due residential real estate commercial consumer and other total non accrual loans residential real estate commercial consumer and other total total non performing assets non performing assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans accruing loans days past due troubled debt restructurings not included in non performing assets n m interest income as of december   non performing assets have not been reduced by us government guarantees of million 
amounts represent estimated interest income that would have been recognized on loans accounted for on a non accrual basis as of the end of each period had such loans performed pursuant to contractual terms 
n m not measurable as a result of the company continued focus on actively managing the disposition of its non performing assets  the company had a current year decrease of million  or percent  in non performing assets to million at december  the company early stage delinquencies accruing loans days past due has seen a significant decrease during the second half of and decreased million  or percent  to million at december  compared to early stage delinquencies of million as of december  the largest category of non performing assets was the land  lot and other construction loans category  a regulatory classification  which was million  or percent  of the non performing assets at december  included in this category was million of land development loans and million in unimproved land loans at december  although land  lot and other construction loans have put pressure on the company credit quality  the company has continued to reduce this category in the current and prior year 

table of contents most of the company s non performing assets are secured by real estate  and based on the most current information available to management  including updated appraisals or evaluations new or updated  the company believes the value of the underlying real estate collateral is adequate to minimize significant charge offs or loss to the company 
the company evaluates the level of its non performing assets  the values of the underlying real estate and other collateral  and related trends in net charge offs in determining the adequacy of the alll 
through pro active credit administration  the company works closely with its borrowers to seek favorable resolution to the extent possible  thereby attempting to minimize net charge offs or losses to the company 
throughout the year  the company has maintained an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses while working to reduce non performing assets 
the improvement in the credit quality ratios during the year is a product of this effort 
for non performing construction loans involving residential structures  the percentage of completion exceeds percent at december  for non performing construction loans involving commercial structures  the percentage of completion ranges from projects not started to projects completed at december  during the construction loan term  all construction loan collateral properties are inspected at least monthly  or more frequently as needed  until completion 
draws on construction loans are predicated upon the results of the inspection and advanced based upon a percentage of completion basis versus original budget percentages 
when construction loans become non performing and the associated project is not complete  the company on a case by case basis makes the decision to advance additional funds or to initiate collection foreclosure proceedings 
such decision includes obtaining as is and at completion appraisals for consideration of potential increases or decreases in the collateral s value 
the company also considers the increased costs of monitoring progress to completion  and the related collection holding period costs should collateral ownership be transferred to the company 
with very limited exception  the company does not disburse additional funds on non performing loans 
instead  the company has proceeded to collection and foreclosure actions in order to reduce the company s exposure to loss on such loans 
construction loans  a regulatory classification 
accounted for percent of the company non accrual loans as of december  land  lot and other construction loans  a regulatory classification  were percent of the non accrual construction loans 
of the company s million of non accrual construction loans at december   percent of such loans had collateral properties securing the loans in western montana and idaho 
with locations and operations in the contiguous northern rocky mountain states of idaho and montana  the geography and economies of each of these geographic areas are predominantly tied to real estate development given the sprawling abundance of timbered valleys and mountainous terrain with significant lakes  streams and watershed areas 
consistent with the general economic downturn  the market for upscale primary  secondary and other housing as well as the associated construction and building industries have stalled after years of significant growth 
as the housing market rental and owner occupied and related industries continue to recover from the downturn  the company continues to reduce its exposure to loss in the land  lot and other construction loan portfolio 
for additional information on accounting policies relating to non performing assets and impaired loans  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
impaired loans loans are designated impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and therefore  the company has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to fulfill the contractual obligation 
impaired loans include non performing loans ie  non accrual loans and accruing loans ninety days or more past due and accruing loans under ninety days past due where it is probable payments will not be received according to the loan agreement eg  troubled debt restructuring 
when the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and designated as non accrual  all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method 
when the ultimate collectability of the total principal on an impaired loan is not in doubt  contractual interest is generally credited to interest income when received under the cash basis method 
impaired loans were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the alll includes valuation allowances of million and million specific to impaired loans as of december  and  respectively 
of the total impaired loans at december   there were significant commercial real estate and other commercial loans that accounted for million  or percent  of the impaired loans 
the loans were collateralized by percent of the loan value  the majority of which had appraisals or evaluations new or updated during the last year  such appraisals reviewed at least quarterly taking into account current market conditions 
of the total impaired loans at december   there were loans aggregating million  or percent  whereby the borrowers had more than one impaired loan 
the amount of impaired loans that have had partial charge offs during the year for which the company continues to have concern about the collectability of the remaining loan balance was million 
of these loans  there were charge offs of million during 
table of contents for collateral dependent loans and real estate loans for which foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure is probable  impairment is measured by the fair value of the collateral  less estimated cost to sell 
the fair value of the collateral is determined primarily based upon appraisal or evaluation new or updated of the underlying property value 
the company reviews appraisals or evaluations new or updated  giving consideration to the highest and best use of the collateral  with values reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell 
appraisals or evaluations new or updated are reviewed at least quarterly and more frequently based on current market conditions  including deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and when property values may be subject to significant volatility 
after review and acceptance of the collateral appraisal or evaluation new or updated  adjustments to an impaired loan s value may occur 
in deciding whether to obtain an appraisal or evaluation new or updated  the company considers the impact of the following factors and environmental events passage of time  improvements to  or lack of maintenance of  the collateral property  stressed and volatile economic conditions  including market values  changes in the performance  risk profile  size and complexity of the credit exposure  limited or specific use collateral property  high loan to value credit exposures  changes in the adequacy of the collateral protections  including loan covenants and financially responsible guarantors  competing properties in the market area  changes in zoning and environmental contamination  the nature of subsequent transactions eg  modification  restructuring  refinancing  and the availability of alternative financing sources 
the company also takes into account the company s experience with whether the appraised values of impaired collateral dependent loans are actually realized  and the timing of cash flows expected to be received from the underlying collateral to the extent such timing is significantly different than anticipated in the most recent appraisal 
the company generally obtains appraisals or evaluations new or updated annually for collateral underlying impaired loans 
for collateral dependent loans for which the appraisal of the underlying collateral is more than twelve months old  the company updates collateral valuations through procedures that include obtaining current inspections of the collateral property  broker price opinions  comprehensive market analyses and current data for conditions and assumptions eg  discounts  comparable sales and trends underlying the appraisals valuation techniques 
the company s impairment and valuation procedures take into account new and updated appraisals on similar properties in the same area in order to capture current market valuation changes  unfavorable and favorable 
restructured loans a restructured loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr if the creditor  for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider 
the company had tdr loans of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company s tdr loans are considered impaired loans of which million and million as of december  and  respectively  are designated as non accrual 
each restructured debt is separately negotiated with the borrower and includes terms and conditions that reflect the borrower s prospective ability to service the debt as modified 
the company discourages the use of the multiple loan strategy when restructuring loans regardless of whether or not the notes are tdr loans 
the company does not have any commercial tdr loans as of december  that have repayment dates extended at or near the original maturity date for which the company has not classified as impaired 
at december   the company has tdr loans of million that are in non accrual status or that have had partial charge offs during the year  the borrowers of which continue to have million in other loans that are on accrual status

the following table sets forth the changes in oreo for the periods indicated years ended dollars in thousands december  december  december  balance at beginning of period additions capital improvements write downs sales balance at end of period the company believes that the write downs in and are not considered a trend in that several of such properties have characteristics unique to the property  including special or limited use  and locations of such properties 
the company also determined that the write downs were not indicative of a trend which would likely affect the future operating results in light of the remaining holdings of real property and the company s experience in the geographic markets where the properties are located 
however  there can be no assurance that future significant write downs will not occur 
allowance for loan and lease losses determining the adequacy of the alll involves a high degree of judgment and is inevitably imprecise as the risk of loss is difficult to quantify 
the alll methodology is designed to reasonably estimate the probable loan and lease losses within the company s loan portfolio 
accordingly  the alll is maintained within a range of estimated losses 
the determination of the alll  including the provision for loan losses and net charge offs  is a critical accounting estimate that involves management s judgments about all known relevant internal and external environmental factors that affect loan losses  including the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  economic conditions nationally and in the local markets in which the company operates  changes in collateral values  delinquencies  non performing assets and net charge offs 
although the company continues to actively monitor economic trends  soft economic conditions combined with potential declines in the values of real estate that collateralize most of the company s loan portfolio may adversely affect the credit risk and potential for loss to the company 
the alll evaluation is well documented and approved by the company s board of directors 
in addition  the policy and procedures for determining the balance of the alll are reviewed annually by the company s board of directors  the internal audit department  independent credit reviewers and state and federal bank regulatory agencies 
at the end of each quarter  the company analyzes its loan portfolio and maintains an alll at a level that is appropriate and determined in accordance with gaap 
the allowance consists of a specific valuation allowance component and a general valuation allowance component 
the specific valuation allowance component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired 
a specific valuation allowance is established when the fair value of a collateral dependent loan or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate is lower than the carrying value of the impaired loan 
the general valuation allowance component relates to probable credit losses inherent in the balance of the loan portfolio based on prior loss experience  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions of qualitative or environmental factors 

table of contents the bank divisions credit administration reviews their respective loan portfolios to determine which loans are impaired and estimates the specific valuation allowance 
the impaired loans and related specific valuation allowance are then provided to the company s credit administration for further review and approval 
the company s credit administration also determines the estimated general valuation and reviews and approves the overall alll for the company 
the credit administration of the company exercises significant judgment when evaluating the effect of applicable qualitative or environmental factors on the company s historical loss experience for loans not identified as impaired 
quantification of the impact upon the company s alll is inherently subjective as data for any factor may not be directly applicable  consistently relevant  or reasonably available for management to determine the precise impact of a factor on the collectability of the company s unimpaired loan portfolio as of each evaluation date 
the company s credit administration documents its conclusions and rationale for changes that occur in each applicable factor s weight ie  measurement and ensures that such changes are directionally consistent based on the underlying current trends and conditions for the factor 
to have directional consistency  the provision for loan losses and credit quality should generally move in the same direction 
the company s model of eleven bank divisions with separate management teams provides substantial local oversight to the lending and credit management function 
the company s business model affords multiple reviews of larger loans before credit is extended  a significant benefit in mitigating and managing the company s credit risk 
the geographic dispersion of the market areas in which the company operates further mitigates the risk of credit loss 
while this process is intended to limit credit exposure  there can be no assurance that further problem credits will not arise and additional loan losses incurred  particularly in periods of rapid economic downturns 
the primary responsibility for credit risk assessment and identification of problem loans rests with the loan officer of the account 
this continuous process of identifying impaired loans is necessary to support management s evaluation of the alll adequacy 
an independent loan review function verifying credit risk ratings evaluates the loan officer and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio credit quality 
the loan review function also assesses the evaluation process and provides an independent analysis of the adequacy of the alll 
no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain losses that are significant relative to the alll amount  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio applying management s judgment about then current factors  including economic and regulatory developments  will not require significant changes in the alll 
under such circumstances  this could result in enhanced provisions for loan losses

in evaluating the need for a specific or general valuation allowance for impaired and unimpaired loans  respectively  within the company s construction loan portfolio  ie  regulatory classification  including residential construction and land  lot and other construction loans  the credit risk related to such loans was considered in the ongoing monitoring of such loans  including assessments based on current information  including appraisals or evaluations new or updated of the underlying collateral  expected cash flows and the timing thereof  as well as the estimated cost to sell when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the construction loan
