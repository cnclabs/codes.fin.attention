item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  in this annual report 
we maintain automobile maintenance centers at certain airports and in certain urban and off airport areas  which provide maintenance facilities for our car rental fleet 
many of these facilities  which include sophisticated car diagnostic and repair equipment  are accepted by automobile manufacturers as eligible to perform and receive reimbursement for warranty work 
collision damage and major repairs are generally performed by independent contractors 
we dispose of non program cars  as well as program cars that become ineligible for manufacturer repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs  through a variety of disposition channels  including auctions  brokered sales  sales to wholesalers and dealers and  to a lesser extent and primarily in the united states  sales at retail through a network of company operated car sales locations dedicated exclusively to the sale of used cars from our rental fleet 

table of contents item business continued during  we launched rentbuy  an innovative program designed to sell used rental cars 
the program was licensed to operate in states as of december  customers have an opportunity for a three day test rental of a competitively priced car from our rental fleet 
if the customer purchases the car  he or she is credited with up to three days of rental charges  and the purchase transaction is completed through the internet and by mail in those states where permitted 
during the year ended december   of the cars that were not repurchased by manufacturers  we sold approximately at auction  through dealer direct  through our rentbuy program or at retail locations and approximately through other channels 
licensees under our hertz brand we believe that our extensive worldwide ownership of car rental operations contributes to the consistency of our high quality service  cost control  fleet utilization  yield management  competitive pricing and our ability to offer one way rentals 
however  in certain us and international markets  we have found it more efficient to utilize independent licensees  which rent cars that they own 
our licensees operate locations in approximately countries  including most of the countries where we have company operated locations 
see item a risk factors in this annual report 
we believe that our licensee arrangements are important to our business because they enable us to offer expanded national and international service and a broader one way rental program 
licenses are issued principally by our wholly owned subsidiaries  under franchise arrangements to independent licensees and affiliates who are engaged in the car rental business in the united states and in many other countries 
licensees generally pay fees based on a percentage of their revenues or the number of cars they operate 
the operations of all licensees  including the purchase and ownership of vehicles  are financed independently by the licensees  and we do not have any investment interest in the licensees or their fleets 
licensees in the us share in the cost of our us advertising program  reservations system  sales force and certain other services 
our european and other international licensees also share in the cost of our reservations system  sales force and certain other services 
in return  licensees are provided the use of the hertz brand name  management and administrative assistance and training  reservations through our reservations channels  the gold plus rewards and club gold programs  our rent it here leave it there one way rental program and other services 
in addition to car rental  certain licensees outside the united states engage in car leasing  chauffeur driven rentals and renting camper vans under the hertz name 
us licensees ordinarily are limited as to transferability without our consent and are terminable by us only for cause or after a fixed term 
licensees in the united states may generally terminate for any reason on days notice 
in europe and certain other international jurisdictions  licensees typically do not have early termination rights 
initial license fees or the price for the sale to a licensee of a company owned location may be payable over a term of several years 
we continue to issue new licenses and  from time to time  purchase licensee businesses 
franchisees under our dollar thrifty brands both dollar and thrifty sell us franchises on an exclusive basis for specific geographic areas  generally outside the top us airport markets 
most franchisees are located at or near airports that generate a lower volume of vehicle rentals than the airports served by company owned locations 
in canada  dollar and thrifty sell franchises in markets generally outside the top eight airport markets 
the typical length of a franchise is ten years with a renewal option for five years if certain conditions are met 
the franchisee may terminate the franchise for convenience upon days written notice and dollar and thrifty may terminate upon breach of the agreement or for cause as defined in the agreement 
dollar and thrifty offer franchisees the opportunity to dual franchise in smaller us and canadian markets 
under a dual franchise  one franchisee can operate both the dollar and the thrifty brand  thus allowing them to generate more business in their market while leveraging fixed costs 
dollar and thrifty license to franchisees the use of their respective brand service marks in the vehicle rental and leasing and parking businesses 
franchisees of dollar and thrifty pay an initial franchise fee generally based on the population  number of airline passengers  total airport vehicle rental revenues and the level of any other vehicle rental activity in the franchised territory  as well as other factors 
dollar and thrifty offer their respective franchisees a wide range of products and services which may not be easily or cost effectively available from other sources 

table of contents item business continued system fees in the us dollar in addition to an initial franchise fee  each dollar us franchisee generally pays a system fee as a percentage of rental revenue at airport locations and off airport operations 
thrifty in addition to an initial franchise fee  each thrifty us franchisee generally pays a fee as a percentage of rental revenue 
system fees in canada all dollar and thrifty canadian franchisees  whether operating a single brand or co brand location  pay a monthly fee generally based on a percentage of rental revenue 
franchisee services and products dollar and thrifty provide their us and canadian franchisees a wide range of products and services  including reservations  marketing programs and assistance  branded supplies  image and standards  rental rate management analysis and customer satisfaction programs 
additionally  dollar and thrifty offer their respective franchisees centralized corporate account and tour billing and travel agent commission payments 
international dollar and thrifty offer master franchises outside the us and canada  generally on a countrywide basis 
each master franchisee is permitted to operate within its franchised territory directly or through subfranchisees 
at december   exclusive of the us and canada  dollar had franchised locations in countries and thrifty had franchised locations in countries 
these locations are in latin america  europe  the middle east  africa and the asia pacific regions 
the company offers franchisees the opportunity to license the rights to operate either the dollar or the thrifty brand or both brands in certain markets on a dual franchise or co brand basis 
competition in the united states  in addition to local and regional vehicle rental companies  our principal car rental industry competitors are avis budget group  inc  or abg  which currently operates the avis and budget brands and enterprise holdings  which operates the enterprise rent a car company  or enterprise  national car rental and alamo brands 
in the united states  the hertz brand had the highest market share  by revenues  in  and in the first eleven months of at approximately of the largest airports where we have company operated locations 
in europe  in addition to us  the principal pan european participants in the car rental industry are abg  operating the avis and budget brands  and europcar 
europcar also operates the national car rental and alamo brands in the united kingdom and germany  and through franchises in spain  italy and france 
in certain european countries  there are also other companies and brands with substantial market shares  including sixt ag operating the sixt brand in germany  france  spain  the united kingdom  switzerland  belgium  netherlands and luxembourg  and enterprise operating the enterprise brand in the united kingdom  ireland and germany 
in every european country  there are also national  regional or other  smaller companies operating in the airport and off airport rentals markets 
apart from enterprise branded operations  all of which enterprise owns  the other major car rental brands are present in european car rental markets through a combination of company operated and franchisee or licensee operated locations 
competition among car rental industry participants is intense and is primarily based on price  vehicle availability and quality  service  reliability  rental locations and product innovation 
we believe  however  that the prominence and service reputation of the hertz brand  our extensive worldwide ownership of car rental operations and our commitment to innovation and service provide us with a competitive advantage 
our acquisition of dollar and thrifty brands adds two popular value leisure brands enabling us to compete across multiple market segments 
worldwide equipment rental our worldwide equipment rental segment generated  million in revenues during the year ended december  operations product offerings we  through herc  operate an equipment rental business in the united states  canada  france  spain  china and saudi arabia 
on the basis of total revenues  we believe herc is one of the largest equipment rental companies in the united states and canada combined 
herc has operated in the united states since 
table of contents item business continued herc principal business is the rental of equipment 
herc offers a broad range of equipment for rental  major categories include earthmoving equipment  material handling equipment  aerial and electrical equipment  lighting  air compressors  pumps  generators  small tools  compaction equipment and construction related trucks 
ancillary to its rental business  herc is also a dealer of certain brands of new equipment in the united states and canada  and sells consumables such as gloves and hardhats at many of its rental locations 
herc comprehensive line of equipment enables it to supply equipment to a wide variety of customers from local contractors to large industrial plants 
the fact that many larger companies  particularly those with industrial plant operations  now require single source vendors  not only for equipment rental  but also for management of their total equipment needs fits well with herc core competencies 
arrangements with such companies may include maintenance of the tools and equipment they own  supplies and rental tools for their labor force and custom management reports 
herc supports this through its dedicated in plant operations  tool trailers and plant management systems 
locations as of december   and  herc had a total of approximately  and branches  respectively  in the us  canada  france  spain  china and saudi arabia 
herc rental locations generally are located in industrial or commercial zones 
a growing number of locations have highway or major thoroughfare visibility 
the typical location includes a customer service center  an equipment service area and storage facilities for equipment 
the branches are built or conform to the specifications of the herc prototype branch  which stresses efficiency  safety and environmental compliance 
most branches have stand alone maintenance and fueling facilities and showrooms 
herc broad equipment line in the united states and canada also includes  equipment with an acquisition cost of under  per unit  ranging from air compressors and generators to small tools and accessories  in order to supply customers who are local contractors with a greater proportion of their overall equipment rental needs 
as of december   these activities  referred to as general rental activities  were conducted at approximately of herc us and canadian rental locations 
before it begins to conduct general rental activities at a location  herc typically renovates the location to make it more appealing to walk in customers and adds staff and equipment in anticipation of subsequent demand 
business initiatives in early  hertz launched hertz entertainment services  a division which provides single source car and equipment rental solutions to the entertainment and special events industries 
hertz entertainment services provides customized vehicle and equipment rental solutions to movie  film and television productions  live sports and entertainment events  and all occasion special events  such as conventions  and fairs 
hertz entertainment services are tailored to fit the needs of large and small productions alike with competitive pricing and customized  monthly billing 
hertz delivers vehicles and equipment to production locations and a dedicated staff is available to address specific client needs 
productions can also rent equipment for use at special events such as lighting  generators and other machinery 
in february  herc entered into a joint venture with saudi arabia based dayim holdings company  ltd 
to set up equipment rental operations in the kingdom of saudi arabia 
the joint venture entity rents and sells equipment and tools to construction and industrial markets throughout the kingdom of saudi arabia 
customers herc customers consist predominantly of commercial accounts and represent a wide variety of industries  such as construction  petrochemical  automobile manufacturing  railroad  power generation  shipbuilding and entertainment and special events 
serving a number of different industries enables herc to reduce its dependence on a single or limited number of customers in the same business and somewhat reduces the seasonality of herc revenues and its dependence on construction cycles 
herc primarily targets customers in medium to large metropolitan markets 
for the year ended december   no customer of herc accounted for more than of herc worldwide rental revenues 
of herc combined us and canadian rental revenues for the year ended december   approximately were derived from customers operating in the construction industry the majority of which were in the non residential sector and approximately were derived from customers in the industrial business  while the remaining revenues were derived from rentals to governmental and other types of customers 
unlike in our car rental business  where we enter into rental agreements with the end user who will operate the cars being rented  herc ordinarily enters into a rental agreement with the legal entity typically a company  governmental body or other organization seeking to rent herc equipment 
moreover  unlike in our car rental business  where our 
table of contents item business continued cars are normally picked up and dropped off by customers at our rental locations  herc delivers much of its rental equipment to its customers job sites and retrieves the equipment from the job sites when the rentals conclude 
herc extends credit terms to many of its customers to pay for rentals 
thus  for the year ended december   of herc revenues came from customers who were invoiced by herc for rental charges  while came from customers paying with third party charge  credit or debit cards  cash or used another method of payment 
for the year ended december   bad debt expense represented of herc revenues 
fleet herc acquires its equipment from a variety of manufacturers 
the equipment is typically new at the time of acquisition and is not subject to any repurchase program 
the per unit acquisition cost of units of rental equipment in herc fleet varies from over  to under as of december   the average per unit acquisition cost excluding small equipment purchased for less than  per unit for herc fleet in the united states was approximately  as of december   the average age of herc worldwide rental fleet was months 
herc disposes of its used equipment through a variety of channels  including private sales to customers and other third parties  sales to wholesalers  brokered sales and auctions 
licensees herc licenses the hertz name to equipment rental businesses in six countries in europe  in afghanistan and chile 
the terms of those licenses are broadly similar to those we grant to our international car rental licensees 
competition herc competitors in the equipment rental industry range from other large national companies to small regional and local businesses 
in each of the six countries where herc operates  the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented  with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local scale 
the number of industry participants operating on a national scale is  however  much smaller 
herc is one of the principal national scale industry participants in the us  canada and france 
herc operations in the united states represented approximately of our worldwide equipment rental revenues during the year ended december  in the united states and canada  the other top national scale industry participants are united rentals  inc  or uri  sunbelt rentals  home depot rentals and aggreko north america 
a number of individual caterpillar  inc  or cat  dealers also participate in the equipment rental market in the united states  canada  france and spain 
in france  the other principal national scale industry participants are loxam  kiloutou and laho 
aggreko also participates in the power generation rental markets in france and spain 
in china  the other principal national scale industry participants are zicheng corporation  aggreko  jin he yuan  lei shing hong and far east rental 
in saudi arabia  the other principal national scale industry participants are bin quraya  al zahid tractors cat  rapid access  eastern arabia and rental solutions services rss saudi ltd 
competition in the equipment rental industry is intense  and it often takes the form of price competition 
herc competitors  some of which may have access to substantial capital  may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing 
to the extent that herc matches downward competitor pricing without reducing our operating costs  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we believe that herc competitive success has been primarily the product of its more than years of experience in the equipment rental industry  its systems and procedures for monitoring  controlling and developing its branch network  its capacity to maintain a comprehensive rental fleet  the quality of its sales force and its established national accounts program 
other operations our wholly owned subsidiary  hertz claim management corporation  or hcm  provides claim administration services to us and  to a lesser extent  to third parties 
these services include investigating  evaluating  negotiating and disposing of a wide variety of claims  including third party  first party  bodily injury  property damage  general liability and product liability  but not the underwriting of risks 
hcm conducts business at five regional offices in the united states 
separate subsidiaries of ours conduct similar operations in six countries in europe 
seasonality generally  car rental and equipment rental are seasonal businesses  with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during spring and summer 
to accommodate increased demand  we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year 
as business demand declines  fleet and staff are decreased accordingly 
however  certain operating expenses  including real estate taxes  rent  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other facility related expenses  the costs of operating our information technology systems and 
table of contents item business continued minimum staffing costs  remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand 
revenues related to our fleet management services are generally not seasonal 
see item a risk factors in this annual report 
the following tables set forth this seasonal effect by providing quarterly revenues for each of the quarters in the years ended december   and in millions of dollars

employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons  consisting of approximately  persons in our us operations and  persons in our international operations 
international employees are covered by a wide variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting  among other things  compensation  job retention rights and pensions 
labor contracts covering the terms of employment of approximately  employees in the united states including those in the us territories are presently in effect under approximately active contracts with local unions  affiliated primarily with the international brotherhood of teamsters and the international association of machinists 
labor contracts covering approximately  of these employees will expire during we have had no material work stoppage as a result of labor problems during the last ten years  and we believe our labor relations to be good 
nonetheless  we may be unable to negotiate new labor contracts on terms advantageous to us  or without labor interruptions 
in addition to the employees referred to above  we employ a substantial number of temporary workers  and engage outside services  as is customary in the industry  principally for the non revenue movement of rental cars and equipment between rental locations and the movement of rental equipment to and from customers job sites 
risk management three types of generally insurable risks arise in our operations legal liability arising from the operation of our cars and on road equipment vehicle liability  legal liability to members of the public and employees from other causes general liability workers compensation  and risk of property damage and or business interruption and or increased cost of working as a consequence of property damage 
in addition  we offer optional liability insurance and other products providing insurance coverage  which create additional risk exposures for us 
our risk of property damage is also increased when we waive the provisions in our rental contracts 
table of contents item business continued that hold a renter responsible for damage or loss under an optional loss or damage waiver that we offer 
we bear these and other risks  except to the extent the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements 
in many cases we self insure our risks or insure risks through wholly owned insurance subsidiaries 
we mitigate our exposure to large liability losses by maintaining excess insurance coverage  subject to deductibles and caps  through unaffiliated carriers 
for our international operations outside of europe  and for our long term fleet leasing operations  we maintain some liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers 
third party liability in our domestic operations  we are required by applicable financial responsibility laws to maintain insurance against legal liability for bodily injury including death or property damage to third parties arising from the operation of our cars and on road equipment  sometimes called vehicle liability  in stipulated amounts 
in most places  we satisfy those requirements by qualifying as a self insurer  a process that typically involves governmental filings and demonstration of financial responsibility  which sometimes requires the posting of a bond or other security 
in the remaining places  we obtain an insurance policy from an unaffiliated insurance carrier and indemnify the carrier for any amounts paid under the policy 
as a result of such arrangements  we bear economic responsibility for domestic vehicle liability  except to the extent we successfully transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements 
for our car and equipment rental operations in europe  we have established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary  probus insurance company europe limited  or probus  a direct writer of insurance domiciled in ireland 
in european countries with company operated locations  we have purchased from probus the vehicle liability insurance required by law  and probus reinsured the risks under such insurance with hertz international re  a reinsurer organized in ireland  or hire  and or hire bermuda limited  a wholly owned reinsurance company domiciled in bermuda 
this coverage is purchased from unaffiliated carriers for spain 
we also insure a portion of our european property risk through probus 
thus  as with our domestic operations  we bear economic responsibility for vehicle liability in our european car and equipment rental operations  except to the extent that we transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements 
for our international operations outside of europe  we maintain some form of vehicle liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers 
the nature of such coverage  and our economic responsibility for covered losses  varies considerably 
in all cases  though  we believe the amounts and nature of the coverage we obtain is adequate in light of the respective potential hazards 
both domestically and in our international operations  from time to time in the course of our business we become legally responsible to members of the public for bodily injury including death or property damage arising from causes other than the operation of our cars and on road equipment  sometimes known as general liability 
as with vehicle liability  we bear economic responsibility for general liability losses  except to the extent we transfer such losses to others through insurance or contractual arrangements 
to mitigate these exposures  we maintain excess liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated insurance carriers at an aggregate of million for policy periods ended december    and for our international car rental operations outside of europe  we also maintain liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers in such amounts as we deem adequate in light of the respective potential hazards  where such insurance is obtainable on commercially reasonable terms 
our domestic rental contracts for both car and equipment rental as well as our domestic and international long term fleet leasing contracts  typically provide that the renter will indemnify us for liability arising from the operation of the rented vehicle or equipment for car rentals in certain places  though  only to the extent such liability exceeds the amount stipulated in the applicable financial responsibility law 
in addition  many of herc domestic rental contracts require the renter to maintain liability insurance under which herc is entitled to coverage 
while such provisions are sometimes effective to transfer liability to renters  their value to us  particularly in cases of large losses  may be limited 
the rental contracts used in our international operations sometimes contain provisions relating to insurance or indemnity  but they are typically more limited than those employed in our domestic operations 
in our domestic car rental operations  we offer an optional liability insurance product  liability insurance supplement  or lis  that provides vehicle liability insurance coverage substantially higher than state minimum levels to the renter and other authorized operators of a rented vehicle 
lis coverage is provided under excess liability insurance policies issued by an unaffiliated insurance carrier  the risks under which are reinsured with a subsidiary of ours  hire bermuda limited 
as a consequence of those reinsurance arrangements  rental customers purchases of lis do not reduce our economic exposure to vehicle liability 
instead  our exposure to vehicle liability is potentially increased when lis is purchased  because insured renters and other operators may have vehicle liability imposed on them in circumstances 
table of contents item business continued and in amounts where the applicable rental agreement or applicable law would not  absent the arrangements just described  impose vehicle liability on us 
in both our domestic car rental operations and our company operated international car rental operations in many countries  we offer optional products providing insurance coverage  or pai pec coverage  to the renter and the renter immediate family members traveling with the renter for accidental death or accidental medical expenses arising during the rental period or for damage or loss of their property during the rental period 
pai pec coverage is provided under insurance policies issued by unaffiliated carriers or  in europe  by probus  and the risks under such policies either are reinsured with hire or another subsidiary of ours or are the subject of indemnification arrangements between us and the carriers 
rental customers purchases of pai pec coverage create additional risk exposures for us  since we would not typically be liable for the risks insured by pai pec coverage if that coverage had not been purchased 
our offering of lis and pai pec coverage in our domestic car rental operations is conducted pursuant to limited licenses or exemptions under state laws governing the licensing of insurance producers 
in our international car rental operations  our offering of pai pec coverage historically has not been regulated  however  in the countries of the european union  the regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries is evolving  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue offering pai pec coverage without substantial changes in its offering process or in the terms of the coverage or that such changes  if required  would not render uneconomic our continued offering of the coverage 
provisions on our books for self insured vehicle liability losses are made by charges to expense based upon evaluations of estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims 
as of december   this liability was estimated at million for our combined domestic and international operations 
damage to our property we bear the risk of damage to our property  unless such risk is transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements 
to mitigate our risk of large  single site property damage losses globally  we maintain property insurance with unaffiliated insurance carriers in such amounts as we deem adequate in light of the respective hazards  where such insurance is available on commercially reasonable terms 
our rental contracts typically provide that the renter is responsible for damage to or loss including loss through theft of rented vehicles or equipment 
we generally offer an optional rental product  known in various countries as loss damage waiver  collision damage waiver  theft protection or accident excess reduction  under which we waive or limit our right to make a claim for such damage or loss 
this product is not regulated as insurance  but it is subject to specific laws in roughly half of the us jurisdictions where we operate 
collision damage costs and the costs of stolen or unaccounted for vehicles and equipment  along with other damage to our property  are charged to expense as incurred 
other risks to manage other risks associated with our businesses  or to comply with applicable law  we purchase other types of insurance carried by business organizations  such as worker compensation and employer liability  commercial crime and fidelity  performance bonds and directors and officers liability insurance from unaffiliated insurance companies in amounts deemed by us to be adequate in light of the respective hazards  where such coverage is obtainable on commercially reasonable terms 
governmental regulation and environmental matters throughout the world  we are subject to numerous types of governmental controls  including those relating to prices and advertising  privacy and data protection  currency controls  labor matters  charge card operations  insurance  environmental protection  used car sales and licensing 
environmental the environmental requirements applicable to our operations generally pertain to i the operation and maintenance of cars  trucks and other vehicles  such as heavy equipment  buses and vans  ii the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products  including gasoline  diesel fuel and oil  and iii the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of waste materials  including oil  vehicle wash sludge and waste water 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 

table of contents item business continued the use of cars and other vehicles is subject to various governmental requirements designed to limit environmental damage  including those caused by emissions and noise 
generally  these requirements are met by the manufacturer  except in the case of occasional equipment failure requiring repair by us 
measures are taken at certain locations in states that require the installation of stage ii vapor recovery equipment to reduce the loss of vapor during the fueling process 
as of december   we utilized approximately tanks underground and approximately  tanks above ground to store petroleum products  and we believe our tanks are maintained in material compliance with environmental regulations  including federal and state financial responsibility requirements for corrective action and third party claims due to releases 
our compliance program for our tanks is intended to ensure that i the tanks are properly registered with the state or other jurisdiction in which the tanks are located and ii the tanks have been either replaced or upgraded to meet applicable secondary containment  leak detection and spill  overfill and corrosion protection requirements 
we are also incurring and providing for expenses for the investigation and cleanup of contamination from the discharge of petroleum substances at  or emanating from  currently and formerly owned and leased properties  as well as contamination at other locations at which our wastes have reportedly been identified 
the amount of any such expenses or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial 
the probable losses that we expect to incur for such matters have been accrued  and those losses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the aggregate amounts accrued for environmental liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other accrued liabilities were million and million  respectively 
the accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean up activities  and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions  including ongoing maintenance  as required 
cost estimates are developed by site 
initial cost estimates are based on historical experience at similar sites and are refined over time on the basis of in depth studies of the site 
for many sites  the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be reasonably estimated because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site  the nature of the contamination  the involvement of other potentially responsible parties  the application of laws and other standards or regulations  site conditions  and the nature and scope of investigations  studies  and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent  duration  and success of remediation 
with respect to cleanup expenditures for the discharge of petroleum substances at  or emanating from  currently and formerly owned or leased properties  we have received reimbursement  in whole or in part  from certain us states that maintain underground storage tank petroleum cleanup reimbursement funds 
such funds have been established to assist tank owners in the payment of cleanup costs associated with releases from registered tanks 
with respect to off site us locations at which our wastes have reportedly been identified  we have been and continue to be required to contribute to cleanup costs due to strict joint and several cleanup liability imposed by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of and comparable state superfund statutes 
environmental legislation and regulations and related administrative policies have changed rapidly in recent years  both in the united states and in other countries 
there is a risk that governmental environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future and that we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by government agencies or private parties with respect to environmental matters 
in addition  with respect to the cleanup of contamination  additional locations at which waste generated by us or substances used by us may have been released or disposed  and of which we are currently unaware  may in the future become the subject of cleanup for which we may be liable  in whole or in part 
further  at airport leased properties  we may be subject to environmental requirements imposed by airports that are more restrictive than those obligations imposed by environmental regulatory agencies 
accordingly  while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of environmental laws  we cannot offer assurance that our future environmental liabilities will not be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
dealings with renters in the united states  car and equipment rental transactions are generally subject to article a of the uniform commercial code  which governs leases of tangible personal property 
car rental is also specifically regulated in more than half of the states of the united states 
the subjects of state regulation include the methods by which we advertise  quote and charge prices  the consequences of failing to honor reservations  the terms on which we deal with vehicle loss or damage including the protections we provide to renters purchasing loss or damage waivers and the terms and method of sale of the optional insurance coverage that we offer 
some states including california  new york  nevada and illinois regulate the price at which we may sell loss or damage waivers  and many state insurance regulators have authority over the prices and terms of the optional insurance coverage we offer 
see risk management above for 
table of contents item business continued further discussion regarding the loss or damage waivers and optional insurance coverages that we offer renters 
internationally  regulatory regimes vary greatly by jurisdiction  but they do not generally prevent us from dealing with customers in a manner similar to that employed in the united states 
both in the united states and internationally  we are subject to increasing regulation relating to customer privacy and data protection 
in general  we are limited in the uses to which we may put data that we collect about renters  including the circumstances in which we may communicate with them 
in addition  we are generally obligated to take reasonable steps to protect customer data while it is in our possession 
our failure to do so could subject us to substantial legal liability or seriously damage our reputation 
changes in regulation changes in government regulation of our businesses have the potential to materially alter our business practices  or our profitability 
depending on the jurisdiction  those changes may come about through new legislation  the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court  regulatory body or governmental official 
sometimes those changes may have not just prospective but also retroactive effect  this is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time 
moreover  changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have either more or less impact on us than on our competitors  depending on the circumstances 
several us state attorneys general have taken the position that car rental companies either may not pass through to customers  by means of separate charges  expenses such as vehicle licensing and concession fees or may do so only in certain limited circumstances 
recent or potential changes in law or regulation that affect us relate to insurance intermediaries  customer privacy and data security and rate regulation  each as described under item a risk factors in this annual report 
in addition  our operations  as well as those of our competitors  also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations 
we are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the united states or internationally 
such a regime could  however  be quickly imposed if there were a serious disruption in supply for any reason  including an act of war  terrorist incident or other problem affecting petroleum supply  refining  distribution or pricing 
disclosure under section r of the exchange act under section r of the exchange act as added by the iran threat reduction and syrian human rights act of  we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates as defined in rule b thereunder knowingly engage in certain activities specified in section r during the period covered by the report 
hertz holdings and hertz do not conduct any business activities in iran 
but because the sec defines the term affiliate broadly  it includes any entity that controls us or is under common control with us control is also construed broadly by the sec  which includes our sponsors 
our affiliate  cd r  has informed us that an indirect subsidiary of spie sa  or spie  an affiliate of cd r based in france  maintained bank accounts during at bank melli  an iranian bank designated under executive order no 
we had no knowledge of or control over the activities of spie or its subsidiaries

risk factors our business is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  some of which are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below  however  are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us 
any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
in such a case  you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties 
any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow and we believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting our company  however  the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly impact us 
risks related to our business our car rental business  which provides the majority of our revenues  is particularly sensitive to reductions in the levels of airline passenger travel  and reductions in air travel could materially adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
the car rental industry is particularly affected by reductions in business and leisure travel  especially with respect to levels of airline passenger traffic 
reductions in levels of air travel  whether caused by general economic conditions  airfare increases such as due to capacity reductions or increases in fuel costs borne by commercial airlines or other events such as work stoppages  military conflicts  terrorist incidents  natural disasters  epidemic diseases  or the response of governments to any of these events could materially adversely affect us 
further  decreases in levels of airline passenger traffic in key leisure destinations  including florida  hawaii  california and texas  could also materially adversely affect us 
we face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we believe that price is one of the primary competitive factors in the car and equipment rental markets and that the internet has enabled cost conscious customers  including business travelers  to more easily compare rates available from rental companies 
if we try to increase our pricing  our competitors  some of whom may have greater resources and better access to capital than us  may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing 
in addition  our competitors may reduce prices in order to attempt to gain a competitive or to compensate for declines in rental activity 
to the extent we do not match or remain within a reasonable competitive margin of our competitors pricing  our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if competitive pressures lead us to match any of our competitors downward pricing and we are not able to reduce our operating costs  then our margins  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted 
additionally  we could be further affected if we are not able to adjust the size of our rental fleet in response to changes in demand  whether such changes are due to competition or otherwise 
see the sections entitled business worldwide car rental competition and business worldwide equipment rental competition in this annual report 
our business is highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
certain significant components of our expenses are fixed in the short term  including minimum concession fees  real estate taxes  rent  insurance  utilities  maintenance and other facility related expenses  the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs 
seasonal changes in our revenues do not alter those fixed expenses  typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher 
the second and third quarters of the year have historically been our strongest quarters due to their increased levels of leisure travel and construction activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the second or third quarters could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
following our acquisition of dollar thrifty  we expect this risk to increase  as the scale of our car rental business and the related fixed costs have increased 

table of contents a material downsizing of our rental car fleet could require us to make additional cash payments for tax liabilities  which could be material 
the like kind exchange program  or lke program  allows tax gains on the disposition of vehicles in our car rental fleet to be deferred and has resulted in deferrals of federal and state income taxes for prior years 
if a qualified replacement vehicle is not purchased within a specific time period after vehicle disposal  then taxable gain is recognized 
a material reduction in the net book value of our car rental fleet  a material and extended reduction in vehicle purchases and or a material downsizing of our car rental fleet  for any reason  could result in reduced tax deferrals in the future  which in turn could require us to make material cash payments for us federal and state income tax liabilities 
in august  we elected to temporarily suspend the us car rental lke program 
in october  hertz reinstated the program 
see the section entitled management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes in this annual report dollar thrifty similarly used an lke program prior to our acquisition of dollar thrifty  which allowed dollar thrifty to defer a material amount of federal and state income taxes beginning in thus  our dollar thrifty subsidiary is subject to the similar risks described above related to material payments for us federal and state tax liabilities in the event there is a material reduction in the net book value of its car rental fleet  a material and extended reduction in its vehicle purchases and or a material downsizing of its car rental fleet  for any reason 
our ability to continue to defer the reversal of prior period tax deferrals by dollar thrifty will depend on a number of factors  including the net book value of its car rental fleet 
if we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced cars or equipment and the cost of the cars or equipment we purchase increases  our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
we are not a party to any long term car supply arrangements with manufacturers 
the price and other terms at which we can acquire cars thus varies based on market and other conditions 
for example  certain car manufacturers have in the past  and may in the future  utilize strategies to de emphasize sales to the car rental industry  which can negatively impact our ability to obtain cars on competitive terms and conditions 
consequently  there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions 
reduced or limited supplies of equipment together with increased prices are risks that we also face in our equipment rental business 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of cars or equipment  or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms when we acquire cars or equipment and are unable to pass on any increased costs to our customers  then our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
declines in the value of the non program cars in our fleet and declines in the overall number of program cars in our fleet could materially adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
over the last few years the percentage of program cars in our car rental fleet that is  cars that are subject to repurchase by car manufacturers under contractual repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs has decreased 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of the vehicles purchased for our combined us and international car rental fleets were program cars 
we expect this percentage to continue to decrease in the future  particularly as we integrate the operations of dollar thrifty  which operated a lower percentage of program cars than hertz immediately prior to our completion of the acquisition of dollar thrifty 
manufacturers agree to repurchase program cars at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the cars during a specified time period 
therefore  with fewer program cars in our fleet  we have an increased risk that the market value of a car at the time of its disposition will be less than its estimated residual value at such time 
any decrease in residual values with respect to our non program cars and equipment prior to disposition could also materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
the use of program cars enables us to determine our depreciation expense in advance and this is useful to us because depreciation is a significant cost factor in our operations 
using program cars is also useful in managing our seasonal peak demand for fleet  because in certain cases we can sell certain program cars shortly after having acquired them at a higher value than what we could for a similar non program car at that time 
with fewer program cars in our fleet  these benefits have diminished 
accordingly  we are now bearing increased risk relating to residual value and the related depreciation on our car rental fleet and our flexibility to reduce the size of our fleet by returning cars sooner than originally expected without the risk of loss in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand has been reduced 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued the failure of a manufacturer of our program cars to fulfill its obligations under a repurchase or guaranteed depreciation program could expose us to loss on those program cars and materially adversely affect certain of our financing arrangements  which could in turn materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
if any manufacturer of our program cars does not fulfill its obligations under its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreement with us  whether due to default  reorganization  bankruptcy or otherwise  then we would have to dispose of those program cars without receiving the benefits of the associated programs we could be left with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with respect to program cars that were sold and returned to the manufacturer but not paid for  or that were sold for less than their agreed repurchase price or guaranteed value and we would also be exposed to residual risk with respect to these cars 
the failure by a manufacturer to pay such amounts could cause a credit enhancement deficiency with respect to our asset backed and asset based financing arrangements  requiring us to either reduce the outstanding principal amount of debt or provide more collateral in the form of cash  vehicles and or certain other contractual rights to the creditors under any such affected arrangement 
if one or more manufacturers were to adversely modify or eliminate repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs in the future  our access to and the terms of asset backed and asset based debt financing could be adversely affected  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in implementing our strategy of further reducing operating costs and our cost reduction initiatives may have adverse consequences 
we are continuing to implement initiatives to reduce our operating expenses 
these initiatives may include headcount reductions  business process outsourcing  business process re engineering  internal reorganization and other expense controls 
we cannot assure you that our cost reduction initiatives will achieve any further success 
whether or not successful  our cost reduction initiatives involve significant expenses and we expect to incur further expenses associated with these initiatives  some of which may be material in the period in which they are incurred 
even if we achieve further success with our cost reduction initiatives  we face risks associated with our initiatives  including declines in employee morale or the level of customer service we provide  the efficiency of our operations or the effectiveness of our internal controls 
any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows 
an impairment of our goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible assets could have a material non cash adverse impact on our results of operations 
we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and at least annually 
if economic deterioration occurs  then we may be required to record charges for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairments in the future  which could have a material adverse non cash impact on our results of operations 
significant increases in fuel prices or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business 
significant increases in fuel prices  reduced fuel supplies or the imposition of mandatory allocations or rationing of fuel could negatively impact our car rental business by discouraging consumers from renting cars  changing the types of cars our customers rent from us or the other services they purchase from us or disrupting air travel  on which a significant portion of our car rental business relies 
in addition  significant increases in fuel prices or a reduction in fuel supplies could negatively impact our equipment rental business by increasing the cost of buying new equipment  since fuel is used in the manufacturing process and in delivering equipment to us  and by reducing the mobility of our fleet  due to higher costs of transporting equipment between facilities or regions 
accordingly  significant increases in fuel prices or reduced supplies of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign operations expose us to risks that may materially adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
a significant portion of our annual revenues are generated outside the united states  and we intend to pursue additional international growth opportunities 
operating in many different countries exposes us to varying risks  which include i multiple  and sometimes conflicting  foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are subject to change and are often much different than the domestic laws in the united states  including laws relating to taxes  automobile related liability  insurance rates  insurance products  consumer privacy  data security  employment matters  cost and fee recovery  and the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property  ii the effect of foreign currency translation 
table of contents item a 
risk factors continued risk  as well as limitations on our ability to repatriate income  iii varying tax regimes  including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws  iv local ownership or investment requirements  as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations  and v political and economic instability  natural calamities  war  and terrorism 
the effects of these risks may  individually or in the aggregate  materially adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows and ability to diversify internationally 
manufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business 
our cars may be subject to safety recalls by their manufacturers 
a recall may cause us to retrieve cars from renters and decline to rent recalled cars until we can arrange for the steps described in the recall to be taken 
we could also face liability claims if a recall affects cars that we have sold 
if a large number of cars are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply  we may not be able to rent recalled cars for a significant period of time 
those types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles  and could also result in the loss of business to our competitors 
depending on the severity of any recall  it could materially adversely affect our revenues  create customer service problems  reduce the residual value of the recalled cars and harm our general reputation 
our business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized information technology systems and the concentration of our systems creates risks for us 
we rely heavily on communication networks and information technology systems to accept reservations  process rental and sales transactions  manage our fleets of cars and equipment  manage our financing arrangements  account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business 
our reliance on these networks and systems exposes us to various risks that could cause a loss of reservations  interfere with our ability to manage our fleet  slow rental and sales processes  comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively 
we have centralized our reservations function for the united states in two facilities in mobile  alabama and oklahoma city  oklahoma  and we have concentrated our accounting functions for the united states in two facilities in oklahoma city 
our reservations and accounting functions for our european operations are similarly centralized in a single facility near dublin  ireland 
in addition  our major information technology systems are centralized in two facilities in oklahoma city 
our dollar and thrifty brands centralized information systems are located in tulsa  oklahoma and our dollar and thrifty brands rely on communication service providers to link their system with the business locations these systems serve 
any disruption  termination or substandard provision of these services  whether as the result of localized conditions such as a fire or explosion or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact such as an earthquake  storm  flood  epidemic  strike  act of war  civil unrest or terrorist act  could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations  customer service  accounting and information technology functions or by eliminating access to financing arrangements 
the misuse or theft of information we possess could harm our brand  reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities 
because we regularly possess  store and handle non public information about millions of individuals and businesses  our failure to maintain the security of that data  whether as the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others  could harm our reputation  result in governmental investigations and give rise to a host of civil or criminal liabilities 
any such failure could lead to lower revenues  increased remediation  prevention and other costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations 
maintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success  and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
while our hertz  dollar and thrifty brand names have substantial brand recognition in the markets in which they participate  factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control  and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition  such as marketing and advertising campaigns  may not have their desired effects 
in addition  although our licensing partners are subject to contractual requirements to protect our brands  it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
any decline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued our business operations could be significantly disrupted if we were to lose the services of members of our senior management team 
our senior management team has extensive industry experience  and our success significantly depends upon the continued contributions of that team 
if we were to lose the services of any one or more members of our senior management team  whether due to death  disability or termination of employment  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy  financial plans  marketing and other objectives  could be significantly impaired 
we may pursue strategic transactions which could be difficult to implement  disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly 
any future strategic acquisition or disposition of assets or a business could involve numerous risks  including i potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  ii difficulty integrating the acquired business or segregating assets to be disposed of  iii exposure to unknown  contingent or other liabilities  including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition or disposition or against any business we may acquire  iv changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences  and v the failure to achieve anticipated synergies 
if we enter into significant strategic transactions  the related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations  particularly in the case of an acquisition 
the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure  including the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
a material disposition could require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof 
as a result of hertz holdings completion of the acquisition of dollar thrifty  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with dollar thrifty s business  and we have incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness 
see risks related to acquisition of dollar thrifty 
we face risks related to liabilities and insurance 
our businesses expose us to claims for personal injury  death and property damage resulting from the use of the cars and equipment rented or sold by us  and for employment related claims by our employees 
currently  we generally self insure up to million per occurrence in the united states and europe for vehicle and general liability exposures  and we also maintain insurance with unaffiliated carriers in excess of such levels up to million per occurrence for the current policy year  or in the case of international operations outside of europe  in such lower amounts as we deem adequate given the risks 
we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our historical levels resulting from multiple payouts or otherwise  that liabilities in respect of existing or future claims will not exceed the level of our insurance  that we will have sufficient capital available to pay any uninsured claims or that insurance with unaffiliated carriers will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all 
see the sections entitled business risk management and legal proceedings in this annual report 
we could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate and at least one multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities 
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans 
in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans  then applicable law could require us to make an additional contribution to the plan  and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount that we would be required to pay to the plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan funding of vested benefits 
one multiemployer plan in which we participated had significant underfunded liabilities and we withdrew from that plan in december several of our remaining multiemployer plans have underfunded liabilities 
such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability 
in addition  such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
environmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them  or any liability or obligation imposed under them  could materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in connection with our operations  including with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products  such as gasoline  diesel fuel and motor and waste oils 
we cannot assure you that our tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or

risk factors continued that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage 
if leakage or a spill occurs  it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup  investigation and remediation  as well as any resulting fines  could be significant

see the section entitled business governmental regulation and environmental matters in this annual report 
the us congress and other legislative and regulatory authorities in the united states and internationally have considered  and will likely continue to consider  numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 
should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective  demand for our services could be affected  our fleet and or other costs could increase  and our business could be adversely affected 
changes in the us legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations  including laws and regulations relating to taxes  automobile related liability  insurance rates  insurance products  consumer privacy  data security  employment matters  cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business  increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to a wide variety of us laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations  including our profitability 
those changes may come about through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
any new  or change in existing  us law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products  which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability 
for further discussion regarding how changes in the regulation of insurance intermediaries may affect us  see the section entitled business risk management in this annual report 
if customers decline to purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the us legal and regulatory environment in the areas of customer privacy  data security and cross border data flow could have a material adverse effect on our business  primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities  and the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements 
it is also possible that we could face significant liability for failing to comply with any such requirements 
in most places where we operate  we pass through various expenses  including the recovery of vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees  to our rental customers as separate charges 
we believe that our expense pass throughs  where imposed  are properly disclosed and are lawful 
however  we may in the future be subject to potential legislative  regulatory or administrative changes or actions which could limit  restrict or prohibit our ability to separately state  charge and recover vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees  which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
certain new or proposed laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and amendments to regulation ab  could restrict our access to certain financing arrangements and increase our financing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows

one or more of the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities and other corporate opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result  those opportunities may not be available to us 
risks related to our substantial indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  liquidity and ability to compete in our industry 
as of december   we had debt outstanding of  million  which includes the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of dollar thrifty 
our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect us 
for example  it could i make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt securities and to the lenders under our various credit facilities  resulting in possible defaults on  and acceleration of  such indebtedness  ii be difficult to refinance or borrow additional funds in the future  iii require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and investing activities to make payments on our debt  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  iv increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions such as credit related disruptions  including interest rate fluctuations  because a portion of our borrowings are at floating rates of interest and are not hedged against rising interest rates  and the risk that one or more of the financial institutions providing commitments under our revolving credit facilities fails to fund an extension of credit under any such facility  due to insolvency or otherwise  leaving us with less liquidity than expected  v place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms  and vi limit our ability to react to competitive pressures  or make it difficult for us to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and our efforts to improve operating margins 
while the terms of the agreements and instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness contain certain restrictions upon our ability to incur additional indebtedness  they do not fully prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness and do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness 
if new debt or other obligations are added to our current liability levels without a corresponding refinancing or redemption of our existing indebtedness and obligations  these risks would increase 
for a description of the amounts we have available under certain of our debt facilities  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facilities included in this annual report for the year ended december  and note debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our ability to manage these risks depends on financial market conditions as well as our financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to a wide range of risks  including those described under risks related to our business included in this annual report 
if our capital resources including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and access to other refinancing indebtedness and operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs  we may be forced to do  among other things  one or more of the following i sell certain of our assets  ii reduce the size of our rental fleet  iii reduce the percentage of program cars in our rental fleet  iv reduce or delay capital expenditures  v obtain additional equity capital  vi forgo business opportunities  including acquisitions and joint ventures  or vii restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness 
if we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected 
our reliance on asset backed and asset based financing arrangements to purchase cars subjects us to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
we rely significantly on asset backed and asset based financing to purchase cars 
if we are unable to refinance or replace our existing asset backed and asset based financing or continue to finance new car acquisitions through asset backed or asset based financing on favorable terms  on a timely basis  or at all  then our costs of financing could increase significantly and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  interest costs  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued our asset backed and asset based financing capacity could be decreased  our financing costs and interest rates could be increased  or our future access to the financial markets could be limited  as a result of risks and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  including i the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our asset backed and asset based financing arrangements  ii the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset backed indebtedness  iii third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset backed or asset based financing arrangements  including increased credit enhancement or required cash collateral and or other liquid reserves  iv the insolvency or deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of our principal car manufacturers  or v changes in laws or regulations  including judicial review of issues of first impression  that negatively impact any of our asset backed or asset based financing arrangements 
any reduction in the value of certain cars in our fleet could effectively increase our car fleet costs  adversely impact our profitability and potentially lead to decreased borrowing base availability in our asset backed and certain asset based vehicle financing facilities due to the credit enhancement requirements for such facilities  which could increase if market values for vehicles decrease below net book values for those vehicles 
in addition  if disposal of vehicles in the used vehicle marketplace were to become severely limited at a time when required collateral levels were rising and as a result we failed to meet the minimum required collateral levels  the principal under our asset backed and certain asset based financing arrangements may be required to be repaid sooner than anticipated with vehicle disposition proceeds and lease payments we make to our special purpose financing subsidiaries 
if that were to occur  the holders of our asset backed and certain asset based debt may have the ability to exercise their right to direct the trustee or other secured party to foreclose on and sell vehicles to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt 
the occurrence of certain events  including those described in the paragraph above  could result in the occurrence of an amortization event pursuant to which the proceeds of sales of cars that collateralize the affected asset backed financing arrangement would be required to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the affected facility or series  rather than being reinvested in our car rental fleet 
in the case of our asset backed financing arrangements  certain other events  including defaults by us and our affiliates in the performance of covenants set forth in the agreements governing certain fleet debt  could result in the occurrence of a liquidation event with the passing of time or immediately pursuant to which the trustee or holders of the affected asset backed financing arrangement would be permitted to require the sale of the assets collateralizing that series 
any of these consequences could affect our liquidity and our ability to maintain sufficient fleet levels to meet customer demands and could trigger cross defaults under certain of our other financing arrangements 
any reduction in the value of the equipment rental fleet of herc which could occur due to a reduction in the size of the fleet or the value of the assets within the fleet could not only effectively increase our equipment rental fleet costs and adversely impact our profitability  but would result in decreased borrowing base availability under certain of our asset based financing arrangements  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
substantially all of our consolidated assets secure certain of our outstanding indebtedness  which could materially adversely affect our debt and equity holders and our business 
substantially all of our consolidated assets  including our car and equipment rental fleets and donlen lease portfolio  are subject to security interests or are otherwise encumbered for the lenders under our asset backed and asset based financing arrangements
