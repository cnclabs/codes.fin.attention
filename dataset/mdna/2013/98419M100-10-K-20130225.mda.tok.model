references in the consolidated and combined financial statements to itt or parent refer to itt corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries other than xylem 
on and prior to october   our financial position and results of operations consisted of the water equipment and services businesses of itt corporation waterco and have been derived from itt s historical accounting records and are presented on a carve out basis through our distribution date  while our financial results for xylem post spin off are prepared on a stand alone basis 
in addition  financial information for the twelve months ended december  consists of the consolidated results of xylem on a stand alone basis for the two months of november and december and the combined results of operations of waterco for ten months on a carve out basis

see section below entitled separation from itt for additional details regarding the spin off 
overview xylem is a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water  from collection  distribution and use to the return of water to the environment 
our business focuses on providing technology intensive equipment and services 
our product and service offerings are organized into two segments water infrastructure and applied water 
our segments are aligned with each of the sectors in the cycle of water  supply infrastructure and usage applications 
the water infrastructure segment focuses on the transportation  treatment and testing of water  offering a range of products including water and wastewater pumps  treatment and testing equipment  and controls and systems 
the applied water segment serves many of the primary uses of water and focuses on the residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural markets 
the segment s major products include pumps  valves  heat exchangers  controls and dispensing equipment 
water infrastructure serves the supply infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers  lakes  rivers and seas  with filtration  ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment  making the water fit to use  and pumping solutions that move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers  biological treatment  monitoring  and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process 
we provide analytical instrumentation used to measure water quality  flow  and level in wastewater  surface water  and coastal environments 
applied water serves the usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating  ventilation and air conditioning and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building services markets 
in addition  our pumps  heat exchangers  valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities  as well as circulation for food and beverage processing 
we also provide boosting systems for farming irrigation  pumps for dairy operations  and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation 
we sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type 
in the water infrastructure segment for the year ended  we provided more than direct sales with strong application expertise  with the remaining amount going through distribution partners 
in the applied water segment  we provided more than of our sales in through long standing relationships with the world s leading distributors  with the remainder going direct to customers 
the total market opportunity for this equipment and services portion of the water industry supply chain is estimated at billion 
separation from itt on october   itt completed the spin off the spin off of xylem  formerly itt s water equipment and services businesses 
effective as of am  eastern time on october  the distribution date  the common stock of xylem was distributed  on a pro rata basis  to itt s shareholders of record as of the close of business on october  the record date 
on the distribution date  each of the shareholders of itt received one share of xylem common stock for every one share of common stock of itt held on the record date 
the spin off was completed pursuant to the distribution agreement  dated as of october   among itt  exelis inc and xylem 
after the distribution date  itt does not beneficially own any shares of xylem common stock and  following such date  financial results of xylem will not be consolidated in itt s financial reporting 
xylem s registration statement on form filed with the us securities and exchange commission was declared effective on october  xylem s common stock began regular way trading on the new york stock exchange on november  under the symbol xyl 
executive summary xylem reported revenue for of  million  a decrease of from  million reported in revenue grew on a constant currency basis due to the acquisitions of ysi incorporated ysi  mjk automation mjk and heartland pump rental sales  inc heartland within our water infrastructure segment  combined with strong performance in emerging markets 
operating income for the year ended was million  reflecting an increase of million or compared to million in  which was primarily due to reduced separation costs 
operating income in also included measures taken to reduce operating costs  including million of restructuring costs 
additionally  on february  we acquired pims group pims  a wastewater services company based in the united kingdom  for approximately million  including a cash payment of million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
additional financial highlights for include the following net income of million  or per diluted share million or on an adjusted basis free cash flow generation of million  and net cash from operating activities of million orders of  million a increase on a constant currency basis key performance indicators and non gaap measures management reviews key performance indicators including revenue  gross margin  segment operating income and margins  earnings per share  orders growth  working capital  free cash flow and backlog  among others 
in addition  we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented  and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations  liquidity and management of assets 
this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives  including  but not limited to  dividends  acquisitions  share repurchases and debt repayment 
these metrics  however  are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue  operating income  net income  earnings per share basic and diluted or net cash from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
we consider the following non gaap measures  which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies  to be key performance indicators organic revenue and organic orders defined as revenue and orders  respectively  excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  intercompany transactions and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures 
divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation 
the period over period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period 
constant currency defined as financial results adjusted for currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate 
this approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share defined as net income and earnings per share  respectively  adjusted to exclude non recurring separation costs from the spin off  restructuring and realignment costs and tax related special items 
a reconciliation of adjusted net income is provided below 
in millions  except per share data net income separation costs  net of tax restructuring and realignment  net of tax tax related special items adjusted net income weighted average number of shares diluted adjusted earnings per share operating expenses excluding separation costs defined as operating expenses  adjusted to exclude non recurring costs incurred in connection with the separation 
adjusted segment operating income defined as segment operating income  adjusted to exclude non recurring separation  restructuring and realignment costs and adjusted segment operating margin defined as adjusted segment operating income divided by total segment revenue 
free cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results that management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance 
our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non discretionary cash payments  such as debt 
the following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures separation cash payments a free cash flow a includes the separation costs allocated by itt in that have been treated as though they were settled in cash  and capital expenditures associated with the spin off of million and million for and  respectively 
business outlook throughout  the company was faced with challenging market conditions with the volatile global economic environment  especially in europe  as well as dry weather conditions in north america 
we expect these conditions to begin to stabilize in and are projecting low single digit revenue growth for the year as the end markets start to improve 
on a geographic basis  while we expect modest improvement in the us economy and reacceleration in emerging markets growth  we believe that europe will continue to be challenged 
in light of our projected modest revenue growth  we will continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure as well as improving our operational efficiency and effectiveness resulting in our beginning to implement restructuring and realignment actions  primarily in europe 
in  we expect to incur approximately to million in restructuring costs and approximately million in realignment costs to reposition our european business as well as other targeted actions to better positioning us for the future 
we anticipate approximately to million of net savings to be realized in from these actions 
additionally  we currently generate approximately two thirds of our revenue outside the united states  which is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  swedish krona  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  polish zloty  and hungarian forint 
upon consolidation  as exchange rates vary  our revenue and other operating results may differ from expectations 
in this uncertain economy  significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may continue

organic revenue decreased million or during the year which was primarily attributable to weakness in the transport and treatment markets  as well as sustained drought conditions within the united states 
transport and treatment decreased mostly due to a decline in the public utility sector of developed markets caused by a weak capital project environment and delays on shipments 
these declines were partially offset by strength in emerging markets  specifically in the latin america and asia pacific regions 
the results also reflect decreases in the dewatering rental and equipment sales as a result of the unfavorable dry weather conditions within north america and lower coal and gas prices  offset slightly by a benefit from super storm sandy 
overall growth was also muted by continued weakness in europe as a result of challenging economic conditions 
foreign currency translation was favorable by million for as compared to applied water applied water s revenue decreased million  or in a increase on a constant currency basis 
the growth on a constant currency basis was driven by organic revenue growth 
organic revenue grew million or for the year and was principally due to strength in the industrial water sector from a favorable general industrial market across most regions  especially within the united states  russia and asia pacific markets 
the residential and commercial pumps business increased slightly due to favorable growth in the united states but was mostly eclipsed by declines from the weak economic conditions in europe 
the warm  dry weather conditions in north america also drove an increase in the agriculture end market for the year 
foreign currency translation was favorable by million for as compared to orders backlog orders received during decreased by million  or to  million a increase on a constant currency basis 
these amounts include a benefit of million from acquisitions 
organic order decline was million for the year 
the water infrastructure segment orders decreased million  or to  million growth on a constant currency basis  including million from acquisitions 
organic order volume decreased primarily due to the delays in public utility capital expenditure orders coupled with reduced dewatering volumes from dry weather conditions and slowdowns in the oil  gas and mining markets 
orders declined in our applied water segment million  or to  million growth on a constant currency basis  driven by declining organic orders of 
the decline in organic order volume is primarily a result of the warm winter weather conditions in the united states and asia pacific markets impacting the building services end markets  partially offset by strength in the industrial and agriculture markets 
delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements 
typically  large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time 
total backlog was million at december  and million at december  we anticipate that approximately of the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during gross margin gross margins as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased to in from in the increase is attributable to benefits from price realization initiatives and cost improvements offset  in part  by an unfavorable sales mix and inflation

additionally  in we incurred million of realignment costs relating to realigning our european businesses to improve our operational efficiencies 
research and development expenses r d spending increased million or to million or of revenue for as compared to million or of revenue in these increases were primarily due to the impact from recent acquisitions  as well as costs associated with the launching of new products 
restructuring and asset impairment charges during  we incurred restructuring costs of million primarily related to restructuring related severance payments for reductions in force initiatives primarily within our water infrastructure segment 
during  we incurred a million charge related to the impairment of a facility in our applied water segment 
as of december   we consider those restructuring initiatives commenced to date to be substantially completed  with a remaining liability of million related to the restructuring actions 
we estimate annual future net savings beginning in from our restructuring actions will be approximately to million 
separation costs we had non recurring pre tax separation costs of million and million  or million and million after tax during and  respectively 
the components of separation costs incurred during these periods are presented below

prior to the separation this was a shared facility among certain xylem and itt businesses and in connection with the separation  the removal of certain itt operations triggered an impairment evaluation 
the fair value of the applicable assets was calculated using the cost approach 
operating income we generated operating income of million during  a increase from the prior year  primarily reflecting the benefits achieved from cost reductions and price improvements offset  in part  by an unfavorable sales mix  acquisition costs and non recurring separation costs

water infrastructure operating income for our water infrastructure segment decreased million or increased million or excluding separation  restructuring and realignment costs compared with the prior year 
the increase was predominately driven by incremental operating income of million from the acquisitions of ysi  mjk and heartland combined with price realization efforts and operating cost reductions 
these benefits were largely offset by inflation costs on labor and material as well as unfavorable mix from lower dewatering revenues and higher sales in emerging markets 
applied water operating income for our applied water segment increased million or million or excluding separation  restructuring and realignment costs compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to operating cost reductions put in place by the company and savings achieved from restructuring actions in the latter part of the increases were offset  in part  by lower sales volume  an unfavorable sales mix and inflationary pressures on labor and materials 
interest expense interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase during the current year reflected a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september refer to note  credit facilities and long term debt  for further details 
income tax expense the income tax provision for was million at an effective tax rate of compared to million at an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate is lower than as a result of the decrease in non deductible separation costs and a change in the mix of earnings 
effective january   the swedish government enacted legislation that will increase the effective tax rate of the company 
the company is currently implementing strategies to address the impact of this legislation

organic revenue growth of million or during the year was primarily attributable to transport and treatment applications 
transport increased due to dewatering equipment volume from both the public utility and industrial sectors 
the results also reflect increased public utility investment in treatment projects in latin america and the middle east 
overall growth was partially offset by decreased volume in southern europe  which continues to present challenging economic conditions 
foreign currency translation was favorable by million for the annual period ended december   as compared to applied water applied water s revenue increased million  or in  driven by organic revenue growth of million or 
the organic revenue growth reflects gains across all regions lead by double digit growth rates in eastern europe  latin america  china and the middle east  primarily due to increased volume in light industrial and building service applications as a result of new products such as e sv  a high efficiency vertical multi stage pump  and increased volume in the irrigation applications as a result of favorable weather conditions in the united states 
pricing initiatives executed throughout the period also contributed to the revenue growth

organic order growth was for the year 
the water infrastructure segment generated order growth of million  or to  million  including million and million from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency  respectively 
order growth in our applied water segment was million or to  million  driven by organic order growth and million of favorable foreign currency translation due to increased activity in the light industrial  agriculture and heat transfer markets 
delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements

water infrastructure operating income for our water infrastructure segment increased million or million or excluding separation and restructuring costs compared with the prior year 
this increase is led by incremental operating income of million from acquisitions over the same period 
also contributing to the increase were higher sales volumes  lower restructuring expense and benefits from productivity and material costs savings initiatives  partially offset by higher labor and overhead costs  material inflation and unfavorable mix 
applied water operating income for our applied water segment increased million or million or excluding separation and restructuring costs compared to the prior year as higher sales volume and price realization were partially offset by increased spend on research and development and the unfavorable impacts of inflation  and customer and product mix

income tax expense the income tax provision for was million at an effective tax rate of compared to million at an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate is higher than as a result of the unfavorable impact of recording a deferred tax liability on the excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries that has not been permanently reinvested  non deductible separation costs  and an increase in valuation allowances on certain foreign losses  offset in part by tax examination settlements and increased tax exempt interest 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash year ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities foreign exchange total sources and uses of liquidity operating activities during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the million year over year decrease is primarily the result of interest payments on debt of million in  higher tax payments of million and additional contributions to postretirement benefit plans  partially offset by an increase in receivable collections and a decline in payments for separation costs 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the million year over year increase is primarily the result of lower tax and restructuring payments 
this increase was partially offset by net increased uses of cash in working capital driven by spending to support increased sales volumes 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million in and  million in the changes in investing activities are driven almost entirely by cash used for acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  from changes in spending on capital expenditures 
we invested million for the acquisitions of mjk and heartland during while million was used in for the acquisition of ysi in and  million in predominately related to the acquisitions of nova million and godwin pumps million 
capital expenditures for of million were million less than in primarily due to a reduction in dewatering asset purchases to align with current rental demand 
in we spent million on capital expenditures  an increase of million over  primarily due to investments to increase productivity and the expansion of the godwin business 
financing activities during  cash used by financing activities was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities during was driven by dividend payments of million and share repurchases of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for  net proceeds from the issuance of billion in senior notes funded a net cash transfer of billion to our former parent  itt  which included the repayment of funds used in the acquisition of ysi 
in general  the components of net transfers include i cash transfers from the company to parent  ii cash investments from our parent used to fund operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions  iii charges benefits for income taxes  and iv allocations of the parent company s corporate expenses described in this report 
funding and liquidity strategy as a result of the spin off  our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly 
our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations  and access to the bank and capital markets 
our global funding requirements are continually monitored with appropriate strategies executed to ensure liquidity needs are met cost effectively 
based on our current global cash positions  cash flows for operations and access to the commercial paper markets  we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements 
in addition  our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required 
historically  we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities  working capital  capital expenditures  and strategic investments 
if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect  we may need to incur debt or issue equity 
from time to time  we may need to access the long term and short term capital markets to obtain financing 
our access to  and the availability of  financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors  including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating  ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets  and iii the current state of the economy 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us 
we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds  including funds from operations  will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months 
senior notes on september   we issued senior notes of million aggregate principal amount due september the senior notes due and senior notes of million aggregate principal amount due october the senior notes due and together with the senior notes due  the senior notes

non us operations for and  we generated approximately and  respectively  of our revenue from non us operations 
as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states  we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non us operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the us and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but million of these funds outside of the united states 
however  we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile  expected future cash generation and investment opportunities that support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our us operations 
if  as a result of our review  it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue us taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds 
as of december   our foreign subsidiaries were holding million in cash or marketable securities 
as of december   our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled billion 
we have not asserted that million of our excess basis difference will be indefinitely reinvested and have therefore provided for united states or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion 
generally  such amounts become subject to us taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in millions thereafter total debt and capital lease obligations interest payments operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on the balance sheet total commitments in addition to the amounts presented in the table above  we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million 
these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years

we estimate  based on historical experience  that we will spend between million and million per year on environmental investigation and remediation 
at december   we had estimated and accrued million related to environmental matters 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries 
we do not consider the maximum exposure to be material either individually or in the aggregate 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain  involve significant judgments  include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured 
for product sales  delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped  risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  certain agreements contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
where sales agreements contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions  judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables  the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract 
revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied 
the allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition  but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement 
for delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized 
we record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns  rebates and other allowances  based on historical experience and known trends 
warranty accrual 
accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
these accruals are established using historical information on the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers  ongoing product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs  as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount we will distribute to the united states and provide the us federal taxes due on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
furthermore  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional tax expense would result 
if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we also review the carrying value of our finite lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise 
we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
we perform a two step impairment test for goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded  if any 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
in our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  particularly related to future operating results and cash flows 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  assumed royalty rates  future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data 
in addition  the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note  industry segment and geographic data  of the consolidated and combined financial statements  or one level below 
the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value  and accordingly  no impairment charges were recorded 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimates on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical basis point increase to the discount rates utilized  a ten percent reduction in expected future cash flows  and reduced the assumed future growth rates of each reporting unit by basis points 
these hypothetical changes did not result in any reporting unit failing step one of the impairment test 
further  our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value 
postretirement plans 
prior to the spin off  employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various retirement plans administered by itt 
in connection with the spin off  we entered into a benefit and compensation matters agreement with itt whereby xylem agreed to adopt or assume sponsorship of certain defined benefit plans and replicate certain itt defined contribution plans to allow for continuation of those benefits 
under this agreement  assets and liabilities attributable to xylem employees were transferred from itt to our qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit pension plans 
the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these pension plans are dependent on various assumptions 
these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  mortality  health care inflation and termination some of which are disclosed in note  postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants  or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants  over the average remaining life expectancy 
significant assumptions management develops each assumption using relevant company experience  in conjunction with market related data for each individual country in which such plans exist 
all assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as necessary 
the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years and us int l us int l benefit obligation assumptions discount rate rate of future compensation increase net periodic benefit cost assumptions discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of future compensation increase we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns 
specifically  the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation  which is detailed in note  postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based on the approach described above  the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected long term rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 
a expected long term rate of return on plan assets actual rate of return on plan assets a represents pre spin off from itt and does not include returns on plans transferred from itt upon spin off 
for the recognition of net periodic pension cost  the calculation of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is generally derived using a market related value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years 
the use of fair value  rather than a calculated value  could materially affect net periodic pension cost 
our weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans  effective january  is 
we estimate that every basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by million 
the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period 
the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa aa bonds  with maturities between zero and thirty years  developed by the plan s actuaries 
annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single point discount rate matching the plan s characteristics 
our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january   is 
we estimate that every basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by million 
the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
effective january   our expected rate of future compensation is for all pension plans 
the estimated impact of a basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than million 
the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care the health care trend rate is for  decreasing ratably to in an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than million  and impact the benefit obligation by approximately million 
to the extent that actual experience differs from these assumptions  the effect will be amortized over the average future service of the covered active employees 
funded status funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets 
we estimate that every basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately million 
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments  including domestic and foreign equity securities  interests in private equity and hedge funds  fixed income investments  insurance contracts  real estate  and cash and cash equivalents 
a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds 
the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value 
however  in certain instances  the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date 
accordingly  we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date 
these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers  as well as general market information 
the adjustment recorded at december  for these assets represented less than one half of one percent of total plan assets 
there were no adjustments for these assets at december  asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices 
we estimate that a change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements see note  recently issued accounting pronouncements  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
there were no new pronouncements which we expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiaries functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers  when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities 
in january  we began to enter into currency forward contracts periodically in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions associated with third party sales and purchases 
our principal currency exposures relate to the euro  swedish krona  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  polish zloty  and hungarian forint 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to xylem s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio entirely comprises long term  fixed rate instruments 
we do not account for our long term debt using the fair value option 
commodity price exposures portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities  such as copper  nickel and aluminum  among others 
our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts 
we generally maintain long term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts  however  we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
