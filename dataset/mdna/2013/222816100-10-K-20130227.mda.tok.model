item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early stage and late stage product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes early development services  which includes discovery support services  preclinical and clinical pharmacology service offerings  and late stage development services  which includes central laboratory  phase ii iv clinical development and market access services 
although each segment has separate services within it  they can be and increasingly are  combined in integrated service offerings 
covance believes it is one of the largest drug development services companies  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to provide data to clients as rapidly as possible and reduce product development time 
we believe this enables covance customers to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance comprehensive services and broad experience provide its customers with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
critical accounting policies covance consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered  depending on the nature of the work contracted 
historically  a majority of covance net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years  but can extend in duration up to five years or longer 
covance also has committed minimum volume arrangements with certain clients with initial terms that generally range in duration from three to ten years 
underlying these arrangements are individual project contracts for the specific services to be provided 
these arrangements enable our clients to secure our services in exchange for which they commit to purchase an annual minimum dollar value volume of services 
under these types of arrangements  if the annual minimum volume commitment is not reached  the client is required to pay covance for the shortfall 
progress towards the achievement of annual minimum volume commitments is monitored throughout the year 
annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not included in net revenues until the amount has been determined and agreed to by the client 
covance does not have any individual significant contracts as pertains to revenue recognition 
by way of background  at any point in time covance is working on thousands of active client projects  which are governed by individual contracts 
in addition  the company had one customer that accounted for of consolidated net revenues in there were no customers accounting for or more of consolidated net revenues in or covance serves in excess of  biopharmaceutical companies and has over  active client projects 
most projects are customized based on the needs of the client  the type of services being provided  therapeutic indication of the drug  geographic locations and other variables 
project specific terms related to pricing  billing milestones and the scope and type of services to be provided are generally negotiated and contracted on a project by project basis 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods  revenue is recognized as services are performed  measured on a proportional performance basis  generally using output measures that are specific to the service provided 
examples of output measures in our early development segment include the number of slides read  dosings performed  or specimens prepared for preclinical laboratory services  or number of dosings or number of volunteers enrolled for clinical pharmacology 
examples of output measures in our late stage development segment phase ii iv clinical development service offering include among others  number of investigators enrolled  number of sites initiated  number of patients enrolled and number of monitoring visits completed 
revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of work completed by the total units of work required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value 
the total contract value  or total contractual payments  represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be provided 
covance does not have any contractual arrangements spanning multiple accounting periods where revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis under which the company has earned more than an immaterial amount of performance based revenue ie potential additional revenue tied to specific deliverables or performance 
changes in the scope of work are common  especially under long term contracts  and generally result in a change in contract value 
once the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms  the contract value is amended and revenue is recognized  as described above 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
for the years ended december   and  covance did not experience a change in the estimates used to determine the amounts recognized as revenue ie output measures or costs to complete for any project resulting in a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract by contract basis 
in some cases  covance bills the client for the total contract value in progress based installments as certain non contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration  such as  but not limited to  contract signing  initial dosing  investigator site initiation  patient enrollment or database lock 
the term billing milestone relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project 
these billing milestones are not performance based ie  potential additional arrangement consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance 
in other cases  billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time eg  monthly billings 
in either case  the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the client would be the same at the end of the project 
while covance attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of services  this is not always the case  as evidenced by fluctuations in the levels of unbilled services and unearned revenue from period to period 
while a project is ongoing  cash payments are not necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time  as revenues are recognized when services are provided  while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms 
in some cases  payments received are in excess of revenue recognized 
for example  a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of of the full contract value upon contract signing  but at the time of signing  performance of services has not yet begun  and therefore  no revenue has yet been recognized 
payments received in advance of services being provided  such as in this example  are deferred as unearned revenue on the balance sheet 
as the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized  the unearned revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period 
in other cases  services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced 
in these cases  revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed  and the difference  representing an unbilled receivable  is recorded for this amount which is currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms 
once the client is invoiced  the unbilled services are reduced for the amount billed  and a corresponding account receivable is recorded 
all unbilled services are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date 
most contracts are terminable by the client  either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts often require payment to covance of expenses to wind down the study or project  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured 
bad debts 
covance endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business 
covance maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected 
this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management judgment  actual bad debt write offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded 
historically  bad debt write offs have not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
taxes 
since covance conducts operations on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions in which covance operates 
in addition  covance maintains a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  changes to which could impact covance effective tax rate in the period such changes are made 
the company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the company believes it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position 
components of the reserve are classified as either a current or long term liability in the consolidated balance sheet based on when the company expects each of the items to be settled 
covance accrues interest and penalties in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
covance maintains a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for income tax exposures  such as transfer pricing  nexus and deemed income  which is recorded as a long term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively 
included in the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and is accrued interest of million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million  primarily associated with the settlement of various income tax audits  partially offset by the accrual of additional reserves of million  primarily relating to transfer pricing and the accrual of interest on existing reserves 
during the year ended december   the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was increased by million  resulting from the accrual of additional reserves of million  primarily relating to transfer pricing and the accrual of interest on existing reserves  partially offset by million in reductions due to settlements and the expiration of the period of review of filings in certain jurisdictions 
following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits  excluding accrued interest  for the years ended december   and dollars in millions unrecognized tax benefits as of december  additions related to tax positions in the prior year additions related to tax positions in the current year reductions due to settlements and payments reductions due to statute expiration unrecognized tax benefits as of december  additions related to tax positions in the current year reductions due to settlements and payments reductions due to statute expiration unrecognized tax benefits as of december  additions related to tax positions in the current year reductions due to settlements and payments reductions due to statute expiration unrecognized tax benefits as of december  any future changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  resulting from the recognition of tax benefits  would impact the effective tax rate of covance 
over the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that the uncertainty surrounding up to million  including accrued interest of million  of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to certain income taxes  deemed income and transfer pricing will be resolved as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations or the conclusion of various federal  state and foreign tax audits 
the following tax years remain open to investigation as of december   for the company major jurisdictions tax jurisdiction years us federal and state united kingdom switzerland germany the company also maintains a tax reserve related to exposures for non income tax matters  including value added tax  state sales and use and other taxes 
the balance of this reserve at december  and was million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a current liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
while covance believes it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve 
covance policy is to provide income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries only to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted 
covance historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states  except for amounts remitted under the american jobs creation act of covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states 
as a result  taxes have not been provided on any of the remaining accumulated foreign unremitted earnings totaling approximately million at december  stock based compensation 
the company sponsors several stock based compensation plans pursuant to which non qualified stock options and restricted stock awards are granted to eligible employees 
the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
the grant date fair value of stock awards is based upon the underlying price of the stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of stock option awards must be determined using an option pricing model 
option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to a the expected term of the option  b the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock  c the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option and d pre vesting forfeiture rates 
the company uses the lattice binomial option pricing formula for determining the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
the expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term and expected employee exercise and expected post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based upon the volatility of the company stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based upon the implied yields currently available from the us treasury zero coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the expected term of the option 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based upon past voluntary termination behavior and past option forfeitures 
the following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended december   and expected stock price volatility range of risk free interest rates expected life of options years changes in any of these assumptions could impact  potentially materially  the amount of expense recorded in future periods related to stock based awards 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options granted was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested performance based shares and restricted stock awards was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
impairment of assets 
covance reviews its long lived assets  other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon covance judgment of its ability to recover the value of the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
during the fourth quarter of  covance determined that the carrying value of its equity method investment in a supplier of research products was no longer fully recoverable based upon changes in the research product market 
the impairment was determined to be other than temporary and covance recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value as of december  further  during the second quarter of  the equity investment was determined to have experienced an additional impairment in value due to a further decline in demand for the research products from this supplier 
as a result  covance recorded a million impairment charge to write off the remaining carrying value of the equity investment as of june   net of the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from this supplier 
during the third quarter of  covance determined that long lived assets used in its north american toxicology operations  located in chandler  arizona and manassas  virginia with carrying values of million and million  respectively  were no longer fully recoverable from the cash flows expected from those assets 
accordingly  as of september   covance recorded an asset impairment charge totaling million million of which relates to the chandler  arizona assets and million relates to the manassas  virginia assets  representing the excess of the carrying value of those assets over their respective fair market values 
covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter 
covance tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level only when  after completing a qualitative analysis  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value 
this test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
covance assesses fair value based upon its estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be generated by the reporting unit 
in the second quarter of  covance commenced actions to close its clinical pharmacology operations located in basel  switzerland and as a result determined the goodwill associated with the acquisition of the basel clinic was impaired and recorded a charge of million to write off the carrying value of the goodwill as of june  the basel clinic is part of covance early development segment and clinical pharmacology reporting unit  however  because the clinic was operated on a standalone basis and was not integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition  the related goodwill was evaluated for impairment at the site level and not the reporting unit level 
the annual test for impairment performed for  and indicated that no reporting units were at significant risk for impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the present value of a reporting unit future cash flows might impact subsequent years assessments of impairment 
defined benefit pension plans 
covance sponsors defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at several foreign subsidiaries as well as a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan and a post employment retiree health and welfare plan for the benefit of eligible employees at certain us subsidiaries 
the measurement of the related benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost recorded each year is based upon actuarial computations which require the use of judgment as to certain assumptions 
the more significant of these assumptions are a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligation  b the expected return on plan assets for funded plans  and c the expected future rate of salary increases for pay related plans 
actual results such as the return on plan assets  future rate of salary increases and plan participation rates will likely differ from the assumptions used 
those differences  along with changes that may be made in the assumptions used from period to period  will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnote disclosures 
set forth below is a discussion of the impact that a differences between assumed results and actual results and b assumption changes have had on our results of operations for the years ended december   and and on the financial position of the plans as of december  and for our united kingdom defined benefit pension plans the largest of our defined benefit type pension plans 
united kingdom plans dollars in millions net periodic pension cost assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost discount rate expected rate of return on assets salary increases the movement in the net periodic benefit cost from period to period is attributable to the following united kingdom plans dollars in millions to to to change in discount rate change in rate of salary increases other  including differences between actual experience and assumptions used net change in periodic benefit cost united kingdom plans assumptions used to determine benefit obligation discount rate salary increases the change in the projected benefit obligation from period to period is attributable to the following united kingdom plans dollars in millions to to projected benefit obligation  beginning of year service interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost in year benefits paid actuarial loss decrease in discount rate other  including differences between actual experience and assumptions used foreign currency exchange rate changes projected benefit obligation  end of year foreign currency risks since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of certain contracts 
the first risk can occur when covance executes contracts with its customers where the contracts are denominated in a currency different than the local currencies of the covance subsidiaries performing work under the contracts 
as a result  revenue recognized for services rendered may be denominated in a currency different from the currencies in which the subsidiaries expenses are incurred 
fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time the contract is executed and pricing is established to the time services are rendered and revenue is recognized can affect the subsidiary net revenues and resultant earnings 
this risk is generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance subsidiaries providing clinical services 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance consolidated financial results 
see risk factors 
we also have other cross currency contracts executed by other covance subsidiaries where the foreign currency amounts billed are determined by converting local currency revenue amounts to the contract billing currency using the exchange rates in effect at the time services are rendered 
these contracts do not give rise to foreign currency denominated revenue and local currency denominated expenses  but they do give rise to a second type of risk 
this second type of risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under both of these types of contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because such invoices are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount as of the invoice date 
subsequent changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared to the time payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable was recorded 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  in the consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet includes the cumulative translation account balance of million 
operating expenses and reimbursable out of pockets covance segregates its recurring operating expenses among four categories cost of revenue  reimbursable out of pocket expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefits  other direct costs  shipping and handling fees  and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  tends and is expected to fluctuate from one period to another  as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving thousands of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators  volunteers and other out of pocket costs such as for travel  printing  meetings  couriers  etc  for which it is reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor  passing through these costs without risk or reward to covance 
all other out of pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased  or excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  to billion for from billion for net revenues from covance early development segment decreased  or excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
the decline in the early development segment was due primarily to lower volumes in toxicology  clinical pharmacology  research products and discovery support  only partially offset by an increase in nutritional chemistry 
net revenues from covance late stage development segment increased  or excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
growth in the late stage development segment was led by the continued strong performance of our phase ii iv clinical development services on increased study activity and higher volumes in our central laboratory services  which was partially offset by decreased volume in our market access services 
cost of revenue increased to billion or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to billion or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins decreased by basis points to for from for the corresponding period due to an inventory charge to write down certain preclinical inventory and costs associated with the expected settlement of an inventory supply agreement of million or of net revenues and lower volumes in early development  which was only partially offset by margin expansion in late stage services from the operating leverage on the volume increase 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased basis points to in from in included in selling  general and administrative expenses during is million or of net revenues in costs associated with the restructuring actions to better align capacity to preclinical market demand and further improve profitability going forward 
these actions include the closure of the company toxicology facility in chandler  arizona  its clinical pharmacology facilities in honolulu  hawaii and basel  switzerland  as well as a capacity and workforce reduction in muenster  germany and in its corporate and functional support infrastructure 
included in selling  general and administrative expense during the corresponding period was million or of net revenues in costs associated with the restructuring initiatives to rationalize capacity  reduce the cost of overhead and support functions and to streamline processes  as well as million or of net revenues in costs associated with the termination of a long standing inventory supply agreement and related inventory write down 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues can and does vary depending on the timing and nature of various professional fees and other discretionary spending 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  depreciation and amortization increased by basis points to for the period from for the corresponding period 
depreciation and amortization during the period includes million or of net revenues in accelerated depreciation associated with the restructuring initiatives described above  as compared to million or of net revenues in accelerated depreciation in the period 
the balance of the growth results from an increase in assets placed in service over the last year 
income from operations decreased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
the period includes a goodwill impairment charge of million or of net revenues related to the basel clinic  which is included in our early development segment results  as well as the restructuring charges of million or of net revenues and the inventory write down and costs associated with the expected settlement of an inventory supply agreement totaling million or of net revenues discussed above 
income from operations for included restructuring costs of million or of net revenues and costs associated with the termination of an inventory supply agreement and related inventory write down of million or of net revenues 
income from operations from covance early development segment for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  compared to million for the corresponding period 
as a percentage of net revenues  early development income from operations decreased  basis points from of early development net revenues in the period to in the corresponding period 
the decline in income from operations in covance early development segment for the period is primarily driven by restructuring and other charges of million or of segment net revenues  the goodwill impairment charge of million or of segment net revenues and the inventory write down and costs associated with the expected settlement of an inventory supply agreement totaling million or of segment net revenues versus restructuring costs of million or of segment net revenues and costs associated with the termination of an inventory supply agreement and related inventory write down of million or of segment net revenues included in the period 
in addition  the period reflects the impact of lower volume in toxicology  clinical pharmacology  research products and discovery support services  as described above 
income from operations from covance late stage development segment for the year ended december  increased or million to million as compared to million for the corresponding period 
as a percentage of net revenues  late stage development income from operations increased basis points from of late stage development net revenues in to of net revenues in the corresponding period  resulting from operating leverage on the increase in volume in both phase ii iv clinical development and central laboratories  partially offset by the decrease in volume in market access services 
income from operations from covance late stage development segment for the period includes restructuring charges of million or of segment net revenues compared to million or of net revenues in the corresponding period 
corporate expense increased million to million or of net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period driven primarily by higher information technology spending associated with the corporate components of the company strategic it initiatives 
corporate expenses for the year ended december  includes restructuring charges of million or of net revenues compared to million or of net revenues included in the corresponding period 
also included in corporate expense is stock based compensation expense which totaled million or of net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
other expense  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the corresponding period 
the largest driver of the reduction was lower impairment charges on an equity investment in a supplier of research products which totaled million in versus million in in addition  the period includes a gain on the sale of an investment of million 
partially offsetting these reductions is an increase of million in net interest expense to million in the period from million in the corresponding period due to higher average borrowing levels  an increase of million in net foreign exchange transaction losses to million in the period from million in the corresponding period and the inclusion in the period of a loss on the sale of a business of million 
covance effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the corresponding period 
covance effective tax rate for the period includes a net tax benefit of million primarily associated with the settlement of various income tax audits across multiple jurisdictions  million associated with a reduction in the united kingdom income tax rate  which resulted in a decrease in the company united kingdom net deferred tax liabilities  and a million benefit related to million of restructuring cost actions and other charges 
there was no tax benefit recorded for either the million goodwill impairment or the million equity investment impairment 
covance effective tax rate for the period includes the tax impact of the cost reduction actions and costs associated with the termination of an inventory supply agreement and inventory write down totaling million 
the company also recorded a net income tax benefit of million  primarily related to tax positions taken on returns filed in  coupled with a decline in net deferred tax liabilities resulting from a reduction in the future united kingdom income tax rate  partially offset by the accrual of additional reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the remaining year over year decrease in covance effective tax rate is attributable primarily to a shift in the mix of our pre tax earnings across various tax jurisdictions and to the impact of tax planning initiatives 
covance has a minority equity position in noveprim limited noveprim  a supplier of research products 
during the years ended december  and  covance recognized income of thousand and million  respectively  representing its share of noveprim earnings  net of the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from noveprim and still on hand at covance 
the company suspended equity accounting for this investment effective june  as it had reduced the carrying value of its investment to zero 
net income of million for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to million for the corresponding period 
net income for the period includes million  net of tax  for asset impairments  restructuring charges  an inventory write down and costs associated with the expected settlement of an inventory supply agreement 
these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of million for favorable tax settlements and a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of an investment 
the period includes million  net of tax  related to restructuring  contract termination and inventory write down costs and the impairment of an equity investment 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased  or excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  to billion for from billion for net revenues from covance early development segment increased  or excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
growth in the early development segment was driven by a number of factors  including the inclusion of a full year of results in the period from the sites acquired in october from sanofi  revenue growth in our north american toxicology services  excluding vienna  virginia  and growth in our global analytical chemistry  discovery and translational and clinical pharmacology services 
partially offsetting the growth in these service offerings was a decline in revenue from lower volumes for our research products  legacy european toxicology services and our vienna  virginia toxicology facility  where services have been wound down and largely transitioned to other locations 
net revenues from covance late stage development segment grew  or excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
growth in our phase ii iv clinical development services  on increased study activity  was partially offset by a reduction in net revenue from lower testing volume in our central laboratory services 
cost of revenue increased to billion or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to billion or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins were for both and losses incurred in connection with the wind down and transition of our virginia toxicology services  the opening of our new specialty toxicology services in indiana and the launch of our pre clinical facility in china coupled with lower profitability in our central laboratory and legacy european toxicology services  from reduced volumes  were offset by higher earnings in our other early development and late stage development services from the higher net revenue levels mentioned above 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased basis points to in from in included in selling  general and administrative expense during the period is million or of net revenues in costs associated with restructuring initiatives  as well as million or of net revenues in costs associated with the termination of a long standing inventory supply agreement and related inventory write down  as compared to million or of net revenues in restructuring costs for the period 
these restructuring initiatives and cost reduction actions were taken to rationalize capacity  reduce the cost of overhead and support functions and to streamline processes 
the inventory supply agreement was terminated due to a decline in demand for a research product  which also resulted in the write down of inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues can and does vary depending on the timing and nature of various professional fees and other discretionary spending 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for from million for as a result of depreciation on assets placed in service over the last year 
as a percentage of net revenues  depreciation and amortization decreased by basis points to for the period from for the corresponding period 
depreciation and amortization during the period includes million or of net revenues in accelerated depreciation associated with the restructuring initiatives described above  as compared to million or of net revenues in the period 
income from operations increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
the period includes asset impairment charges of million or of net revenues associated with long lived assets in chandler  arizona and manassas  virginia  which are included in our early development segment results  as well as costs associated with the restructuring initiatives totaling million or of net revenues 
income from operations for includes restructuring costs of million or of net revenues and costs associated with the termination of an inventory supply agreement and related inventory write down of million or of net revenues 
income from operations from covance early development segment for the year ended december  increased by million to million as compared to a loss of million for the corresponding period 
as a percentage of net revenues  early development income from operations increased from negative of early development net revenues in the period to in the corresponding period
