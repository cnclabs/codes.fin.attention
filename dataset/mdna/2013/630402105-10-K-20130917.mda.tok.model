item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a diversified manufacturer of security products  encompassing electronic locking devices  intrusion and fire alarms and building access control systems 
these products are used for commercial  residential  institutional  industrial and governmental applications  and are sold worldwide principally to independent distributors  dealers and installers of security equipment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of our revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and respectively 
the increase in international sales was attributable to increased sales of the company s door locking devices into canada 
the company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in amityville  new york and the dominican republic 
a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed  and do not fluctuate with changes in production levels or utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
as production levels rise and factory utilization increases  the fixed costs are spread over increased output  which should improve profit margins 
conversely  when production levels decline our fixed costs are spread over reduced levels  thereby decreasing margins 
the security products market is characterized by constant incremental innovation in product design and manufacturing technologies 
generally  the company devotes of annual revenues to research and development r d 
the company does not expect products resulting from our r d investments in fiscal to contribute materially to revenue during this fiscal year  but should benefit the company in future years 
in general  the new products introduced by the company are initially shipped in limited quantities  and increase over time 
prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as products and technologies mature 
economic and other factors we are subject to the effects of general economic and market conditions 
in the event that the us or international economic conditions deteriorate  our revenue  profit and cash flow levels could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
in the event of such deterioration  many of our current or potential future customers may experience serious cash flow problems and as a result may  modify  delay or cancel purchases of our products 
additionally  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
if such events do occur  they may result in our expenses being too high in relation to our revenues and cash flows 
seasonality the company fiscal year begins on july and ends on june historically  the end users of napco products want to install its products during the spring and early summer  therefore sales of its products historically peak in the period april through june  the company fiscal fourth quarter  and are reduced in the period july through september  the company fiscal first quarter 
in addition  demand is affected by the housing and construction markets 
deterioration of the current economic conditions may also affect this seasonality 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the company consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  ii there is a fixed and determinable price for the company product  iii shipment and passage of title occurs  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from product sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped or delivered to the customer pursuant to the terms of the sale 
the company reports its sales on a net sales basis  with net sales being computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual sales returns and other allowances and the amount of reserves established for anticipated sales returns and other allowances 
the company analyzes sales returns and is able to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on the company s past history 
estimates for sales returns are based on several factors including actual returns and based on expected return data communicated to it by its customers 
accordingly  the company believes that its historical returns analysis is an accurate basis for its allowance for sales returns 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns  rebates and allowances were for each of the fiscal years ended june  and concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had if it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
the company had two customers with accounts receivable balances that aggregated of the company s accounts receivable at june  and one customer with an accounts receivable balance of at june  sales to any one customer did not exceed of net sales in any of the past two fiscal years 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established a reserve for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable agings  specific exposures and historical or anticipated events 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
the reported net value of inventory includes finished saleable products  work in process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory costs include raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
the company s overhead expenses are applied based  in part  upon estimates of the proportion of those expenses that are related to procuring and storing raw materials as compared to the manufacture and assembly of finished products 
these proportions  the method of their application  and the resulting overhead included in ending inventory  are based in part on subjective estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company records an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents any excess of the cost of the inventory over its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends  requirements to support forecasted sales  and the ability to find alternate applications of its raw materials and to convert finished product into alternate versions of the same product to better match customer demand 
in addition  and as necessary  the company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
there is inherent professional judgment and subjectivity made by both production and engineering members of management in determining the estimated obsolescence percentage 
for the fiscal years and  net charges and balances in these reserves amounted to  and  and  and  respectively 
the company also regularly reviews the period over which its inventories will be converted to sales 
any inventories expected to convert to sales beyond months from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
intangible assets the company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis 
those intangible assets that are classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i the company determines impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if there is impairment  the company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of intangible assets with the carrying amount of the intangible assets 
at the conclusion of the fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment evaluation and determined that its intangible assets were not impaired 
income taxes the company has identified the united states and new york state as its major tax jurisdictions 
the fiscal and forward years are still open for examination

forward looking information this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of the company intends the forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company expected financial position and operating results  its business strategy  its financing plans and the outcome of any contingencies are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on current estimates and projections about our industry and our business 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward looking statements 
for example  the company is highly dependent on its chief executive officer for strategic planning 
if he is unable to perform his services for any significant period of time  the company ability to grow could be adversely affected 
in addition  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the uncertain economic  military and political conditions in the world  the ability to maintain adequate financing  our ability to maintain and develop competitive products  adverse tax consequences of offshore operations  significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dominican peso and the us dollar  distribution problems and unforeseen environmental liabilities 
the company s risk factors are discussed in more detail in item a 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company principal financial instrument is long term debt consisting of a revolving credit facility and term loans that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate or libor as described in the agreement 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under these credit facilities 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately  was outstanding under the company credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company credit facilities remained at this level for an entire year and the interest rate increased or decreased  respectively  by the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest that year 
all foreign sales transactions by the company are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  the company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk relative to expenses incurred in dominican pesos rd  the local currency of the company production facility in the dominican republic 
the result of a strengthening in the us dollar to our rd expenses would result in an annual decrease in income from operations of approximately
