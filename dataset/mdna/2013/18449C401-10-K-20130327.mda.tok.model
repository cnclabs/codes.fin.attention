item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  as a result of many important factors  including those set forth in part i item a risk factors 
all percentage amounts and ratios in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
overview we are a technology focused  leading global manufacturer and distributor of heavy duty diesel and light duty vehicle emissions control systems and products to major automakers  integrators and retrofitters 
we have over years of experience in the heavy duty diesel systems market and proven technical and manufacturing competence in the light duty vehicle catalyst market meeting auto makers stringent requirements 
our business is driven by increasingly stringent global emission standards for internal combustion engines  which are major sources of a variety of harmful pollutants 
we organize our operations in two primary divisions our heavy duty diesel systems division and our catalyst division 
heavy duty diesel systems our heavy duty diesel systems division specializes in the design and manufacture of verified exhaust emissions control solutions 
this division offers a full range of products for the verified retrofit and non retrofit original equipment manufacturer  or oem  and aftermarket markets through its distribution dealer network and direct sales 
our purifilter  purifier  combifilter  cattrap and actifilter products  along with our catalyst technologies  are used to reduce exhaust emissions created by on road  off road and stationary diesel and alternative fuel engines including propane and natural gas 
revenues from our heavy duty diesel systems division accounted for approximately and of the total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
catalyst our catalyst division produces catalyst formulations to reduce emissions from gasoline  diesel and natural gas combustion engines 
using our proprietary mpc technology  we have developed a family of unique high performance catalysts with base metals or low platinum group metal and zero platinum group metal content to provide increased catalytic function and value for technology driven automotive industry customers 
our technical and manufacturing competence in the light duty vehicle market is aimed at meeting auto makers most stringent requirements  and we have supplied over ten million parts to light duty vehicle customers since our catalyst division also provides catalyst formulations for our heavy duty diesel systems division 
revenues from our catalyst division accounted for approximately and of the total consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sources of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our emission control systems and products 
we generally recognize revenues from the sale of our emission control systems and products upon shipment of these products to our customers 
however  for certain customers  where risk of loss transfers at the destination typically the customer s warehouse  revenue is recognized when the products are delivered to the destination 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct costs for the manufacture of emission control systems and products  including cost of raw materials  costs of leasing and operating manufacturing facilities and wages and benefits paid to personnel involved in production  manufacturing quality control  testing and supply chain management 
in addition  cost of revenues include normal scrap and shrinkage associated with the manufacturing process and a expense from write down of obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we include the direct material costs and factory labor as well as factory overhead expense in the cost of revenue 
indirect factory expense includes the costs of freight inbound and outbound for direct material and finished goods  purchasing and receiving  inspection  testing  warehousing  utilities and deprecation of facilities and equipment utilized in the production and distribution of products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense includes the salary and benefits for sales  marketing and administrative staff as well as samples provided at no cost to customers  marketing materials  travel  legal  accounting and other professional fees  corporate expenses  regulatory fees and bad debt 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the selling  marketing and general and administrative functions as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research related to new product development and product enhancement expenditures 
research and development costs also include costs associated with getting our heavy duty diesel systems verified and approved for sale by the epa  the carb and other regulatory authorities 
these expenses include the salary and benefits for the research and development staff as well as travel  research materials  testing and legal expense related to patenting intellectual property 
also included is any depreciation related to assets utilized in the development of new products 
other income expense total other income expense primarily reflects interest expense  including amortization of debt discounts and premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs  as well as changes in the fair value of our liability classified warrants 
it also includes loss on foreign exchange and interest income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
while we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information relating to these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
when terms of sale include subjective customer acceptance criteria  we defer revenue until the acceptance criteria are met 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated product return reserves 
critical judgments include the determination of whether or not customer acceptance criteria are perfunctory or inconsequential 
the determination of whether or not the customer acceptance terms are perfunctory or inconsequential impacts the amount and timing of the revenue that we recognize 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts involves estimates based on management s judgment  review of individual receivables and analysis of historical bad debts 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in difficulties in their ability to make payments as they become due  additional allowances could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands  market conditions and customers who are expected to reduce purchasing requirements as a result of experiencing financial difficulties 
such assessments require the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs could be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 

table of contents product warranty reserves we provide warranties on certain of our heavy diesel division products for varying periods 
generally  the warranty periods range from one to five years and may also contain mileage limitations 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of sales  at the time product revenue is recognized 
warranty costs are estimated primarily using historical warranty information in conjunction with current engineering assessments applied to our expected repair or replacement costs 
the adequacy of the provision is assessed at each quarter end 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would have a negative effect on our earnings and working capital 
accounting for income taxes our income tax expense is dependent on the profitability of our various international subsidiaries including canada  sweden and the united kingdom 
these subsidiaries are subject to income taxation based on local tax laws in these countries 
our us operations have continually incurred losses since inception 
our annual tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
if these factors were to become less favorable than those projected  or if there are changes in the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  there could be an increase in tax expense and a resulting decrease in our earnings and working capital 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates 
to provide insight  we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts 
we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred income tax assets may expire unused and have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred income tax assets  primarily related to foreign tax jurisdictions  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income in certain jurisdictions are significantly reduced or available tax planning strategies are no longer viable 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually  as of october  using a two step process  and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain triggering events 
our engine control systems reporting unit  which is within our heavy duty diesel systems reporting segment  has goodwill subject to impairment testing  which totalled million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value is based on internally developed assumptions approximating those that a market participant would use in valuing the reporting unit 
we derived the estimated fair value of the engine control systems reporting unit at october  from a blending of market and income approach models 
we utilized a weighting of and between the market and income approaches  respectively 
significant assumptions used in deriving the fair value of the reporting unit under the income approach included annual revenue growth over the next five years ranging from to  long term revenue growth of and a discount rate of 
significant assumptions used in deriving the fair value of the reporting unit under the market approach included average multiples of times on revenue and times on ebitda 
the discount rate of was developed based on a weighted cost of capital wacc analysis 
within the wacc analysis  the cost of equity assumption was developed using the capital asset pricing model capm 
the inputs in both the capm and the cost of debt assumption utilized in the wacc were developed for our engine control systems business reporting unit using data from comparable companies 
the revenue growth rates used are higher than our historical growth patterns and consider future growth potential identified by management  however  there is no assurance such growth will be achieved 
in addition  we considered the overall fair value of our reporting units as compared to our market capitalization 
because the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  we determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of december  however  it is reasonably possible that future results may differ from the estimates made during and future impairment tests may result in a different conclusion for the goodwill of our engine controls systems reporting unit 
in addition  the use of different estimates or assumptions by management could lead to different results 
our estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is sensitive to certain factors  including but not limited to the following movements in our share price  changes in discount rates and our cost of capital  growth of the reporting unit s revenue  cost structure of the reporting unit  successful completion of research and development  capital expenditures  customer acceptance of new products  competition  general economic conditions and approval of the reporting unit s product by regulatory agencies 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
if an impairment does exist  we measure the impairment loss and record it based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we group assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and  accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows 
these estimates and judgments are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and growth rates and other factors  actual results of which may vary significantly 
in  we considered whether any events or changes in circumstance indicated that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable and concluded that no such triggering event had occurred during that would lead us to believe that the assets were impaired 
therefore  no further testing was performed 
to the extent additional events or changes in circumstances occur  we may conclude that a non cash impairment charge against earnings is required  which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation using fair value recognition and record stock based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
as such  we recognize stock based compensation cost only for those stock based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period  based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing stock based compensation cost over their requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates  and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period 
as a result  if we revise our assumptions and estimates  our stock based compensation expense could change materially for future grants 
recently issued accounting guidance in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on are after january  retrospective application is required 
the guidance concerns disclosure only and will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures

shelf registration on may   we filed a shelf registration which was declared effective by the sec on may  the shelf registration permits us to sell  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million of various securities  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock and units consisting of one or more shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock  warrants  or any combination of such securities 
the shelf registration is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
factors affecting future results factors affecting our heavy duty diesel systems division the nature of our business and  in particular  our heavy duty diesel systems division  is heavily influenced by government funding of emissions control projects and increased diesel emission control regulations and mandates 
compliance with these regulatory initiatives drives demand for our products and the timing of implementation of emission reduction projects 
emission reduction programs are often one off  or have staggered compliance dates  which mean they do not generally result in a regular source of recurring revenues for our company 
for example  london  uk had mandated that certain heavy duty diesel vehicles entering the london low emissions zone or lez were required to meet certain emission standards by january we believe that approximately  such vehicles were required to have a retrofit emission control device installed on the vehicle by year end in december  the regulator extended the deadline for compliance into the first quarter of we believe that the bulk of the vehicles were retrofitted in the fourth quarter of  with sales of our products of approximately million in the fourth quarter and million in the full year however  due to the extension  we recorded additional sales of million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
this program is now virtually complete and as such  we do not expect sales in london in in addition  carb has mandated that all class and class heavy diesel trucks meet certain emission targets by  with interim targets established for  and  such that of current operating diesel trucks will be required to meet these targets by we estimate that this rule will require well over  heavy duty diesel trucks to be replaced or retrofitted 
according to industry estimates  approximately  vehicles have elected or will elect to retrofit between and we believe that the rate of adoption of electing to retrofit by truck owners as well as the overall level of retrofit activity and our ability to gain sales are dependent upon several factors  including the level of enforcement of the mandate by carb  the level of new truck acquisitions by truck owners and also our success in attaining the required verifications and approvals for products currently under review by carb 
in  we experienced a slower than anticipated ramp up in adoption by truck owners  a delay in enforcement by carb and a delay in verification for a product which was under review by carb 
this resulted in weaker than expected sales in carb began to actively enforce the regulation in the latter part of in january  we received the product verification from carb 
in addition  a key competitor exited the market 
we continue to pursue this retrofit opportunity aggressively and expect sales in california in to be higher than in however  the rate of adoption  industry projections pertaining to the overall market opportunity remain uncertain and could result in fluctuations in revenue and working capital requirements from quarter to quarter next year 
factors affecting our catalyst division because the customers of our catalyst division are primarily oem auto makers  our business is also affected by macroeconomic factors that impact the automotive industry generally  which can result in increased or decreased purchases of vehicles  and consequently demand for our products 
sales to our largest oem auto customer were positively impacted during due to increased vehicle shipments  expansion of our catalysts onto new vehicle platforms  increased purchasing by the customer to build initial stock of parts for a new model and an increase in pass through sales of rare earth materials due to increased prices of these materials 
in addition  our sales and gross margins are also impacted by the pass through sales of rare earth materials and the extent to which the price increases are shared with our customer 
through june  the customer was reimbursing us substantially the full amount actually spent by us on these materials 
for the balance of the year  our customer reimbursed us partially  pending the agreement on a formula for this reimbursement which is based on formulae established by this customer with other vendors 
a formula has been agreed to between our customer and us for all shipments going forward from january  based on this agreed formula  reimbursement from our customer is expected to approach our costs as we deplete existing higher priced inventory levels 
we expect that this will result in improved margins as progresses 
however  this formula is based on published indices of rare earth prices and as such we could experience margin reductions if the formula does not accurately reflect our actual costs 

table of contents supply of catalyst division products to heavy duty diesel systems division our strategy is to progressively utilize the products of our catalyst division in the products of our heavy duty diesel systems division 
we anticipate that our intercompany sales of catalysts will increase compared to historical levels  as our planned new products are approved by the regulatory agencies and begin to generate sales 
while this will not impact our reported sales  we believe that the manufacturing gross margin associated with these sales will improve our total gross margin 
impact of the pirelli joint venture in february  we announced the joint venture with pirelli see recent developments joint venture agreement with pirelli c 
ambiente spa above 
the purpose of the joint venture is to market and sell products manufactured by both cdti and pirelli in europe and the cis countries 
as such  both partners will sell products to the joint venture which will earn a commission to market and sell these products 
all existing cdti business in sweden and the uk will now be conducted through the joint venture 
as a result  we will experience a decline in prices and hence gross margins realized on our sales to the joint venture 
offsetting this decline in gross margins  will be a reduction in infrastructure costs in europe since we will reduce sales  marketing and administrative activities in europe as the majority of these activities will now be handled by the joint venture 
we expect the price and margin impact to begin in the late first quarter 
our infrastructure reduction is expected to be largely completed by the end of lastly  it is the expectation of both partners that the joint venture will result in additional business for both companies products over the next several years 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues the table below and the tables in the discussion that follow are based upon the way we analyze our business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information about our divisions 
year ended december of total revenue of total revenue change change dollars in millions heavy duty diesel systems catalyst intercompany revenue total revenue total revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  revenues for our heavy duty diesel systems division for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to decreased retrofit sales of million and decreased non retrofit sales of million 
retrofit sales decreased million in the london lez and decreased million in north america 
significant programs in north america included california  new jersey and texas 
california sales of million continued to be weak compared to expectations and were down million year over year as we benefited from a carb early compliance incentive program that was implemented in the second and third quarters of sales increased million under the new jersey department of environmental protection mandatory diesel retrofit program  increased million for the retrofit of school buses in the state of texas and decreased million related to the retrofit of school buses in new york and other northeastern states 
non retrofit sales decreased due to a decline in european mining and material handling sales partially offset by an increase in sales of fuel borne catalysts in europe 
revenues for our catalyst division for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  excluding intercompany revenue  sales for this division increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was in part due to the recognition of million in revenue in upon completion of performance under a contract to provide equipment  engineering and support services to assist our investment partner in the asia pacific  tkk  in establishing operations in china to manufacture automotive and exhaust emission products for the china market 
the remaining increase was due to an increase in sales to our japanese oem customer of million  partially offset by a reduction of million in sales to other oem customers in as compared to we eliminate intercompany sales by the catalyst division to our heavy duty diesel systems division in consolidation 

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in costs was higher product sales volume in our catalyst division and increases in costs for rare earth materials which peaked in the first half of additionally  we incurred million in expense related to inventory obsolescence and write downs primarily related to the london lez program which is largely complete see factors affecting future results above 
gross profit the following table shows our gross profit and gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenues by division for the periods indicated 
year ended december of revenue of revenue change change dollars in millions heavy duty diesel systems catalyst intercompany elimination nm total gross profit division calculation based on division revenue  total based on total revenue

one of our oem customers provides price adjustments to isolate us from the impact of rare earth cost increases  but that addition solely covers cost without any additional profit 
through june  that customer was reimbursing us the full amount actually spent by us on these materials 
for the balance of the year  our customer reimbursed us for our rare earth material costs based upon a formula that did not fully reflect our cost basis 
further  due to worldwide supply constraints on rare earth materials  we secured supply to insure adequate availability to meet our oem customer demand 
when rare earth material prices declined during the year  our oem customer s formula provided for reduced reimbursements while we were still consuming the materials previously secured to protect supply 
in addition to our customer reimbursements being less than actual cost  the rare earth reimbursements are without profit  hence are dilutive to our margins 
our catalyst division margins were also impacted by product mix 
in  of the catalyst division sales were intercompany diesel catalyst sales as compared to in diesel intercompany sales are typically at a higher margin than oem sales 
operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december of total revenue of total revenue change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative research and development severance and other charges nm total operating expenses for the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  included in the year ended december  is million in severance expense related to the elimination of several positions at both the heavy duty diesel systems and catalyst divisions and million in other charges related to the exit from facilities in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of a million reduction in stock based compensation  million in reduced costs due to the downsizing of operations in the united kingdom  million in reduced legal  accounting and other public company expenses  all of which were partially offset by million in recruiting and relocation expense related to the hiring of key executives and million of other decreases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of million in reduced costs due to the downsizing of operations in the united kingdom  million in reduced catalyst division scale up expense which were higher in for london lez and new oem models  million in increased product verification costs primarily related to new products for california and million in other decreases 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  severance and other charges during  we initiated actions to streamline both our facilities and our workforce 
these actions were deemed necessary to meet the demands of the markets we serve and our economic environment and to improve our profitability 
we recorded million in costs related to the termination of employees throughout north america  europe  the united kingdom and asia 
we also incurred million in lease termination costs related to the exit of a lease in north america and million asset impairment expense related to the exit of this facility as well as to the exit of a leased facility in the united kingdom

the year ended december  included a million exchange loss related primarily to changes in value of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar as compared to a loss of million in the year ended december  income taxes for the year ended december   we had income tax benefit from continuing operations of million compared to tax expense of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory tax rate for the year ended december  is primarily related to the valuation allowance offsetting the deferred tax assets in both the us and us jurisdictions as well as to a foreign tax rate differential related to sweden and canada 
in addition  the canadian entity incurred operating losses in the current year compared to an operating profit in the prior year  and as such is recording an income tax benefit 
lastly  as of december  we recorded an income tax benefit  associated with the elimination of a portion of the asc tax liability of million 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the us statutory tax rate for the year ended december  is primarily related to the valuation allowance offsetting the deferred tax assets in both the us and us jurisdictions as well as to a foreign rate tax differential related to sweden and canada 
in addition  during the canadian entity had minor operating profit but due to the ability to generate research development credits they were able to generate excess credits  resulting in an income tax benefit 
net loss for the foregoing reasons  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  excluding amounts related to discontinued operations  we had a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  we continue to have legal and other expenses related to the divestiture of the assets of applied utility systems aus 
we record these activities as discontinued operations 
for additional information relating to aus  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  the revenue that we have generated has not been sufficient to fund our operating requirements and debt servicing needs 
notably  we have suffered recurring losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million compared to million at december  we have also had negative cash flows from operations from inception through the year ended december  for the year ended december   we used million of cash for continuing operations compared to cash used of million for the year ended december  we had million in cash at december  compared to million in cash at december   and total current liabilities of million at december  compared to million at december  at december   million of our cash was held by foreign subsidiaries in canada  sweden and the united kingdom 
we do not intend to repatriate any amount of this cash to the united states as it will be used to fund our subsidiaries continued operations 
if we decide to repatriate unremitted foreign earnings in the future  it could have negative tax implications 
our primary sources of liquidity in recent years have been asset sales  credit facilities and other borrowings and equity sales 
we took several steps in to improve our liquidity position 
in february  we entered into a million secured demand financing facility with fgi backed by our receivables and inventory and repaid our previous demand facility with fifth third bank 
on august   the fgi facility was amended and the initial term was extended from february  to august  and may be extended at our option for additional one year terms 
however  fgi can cancel the facility at any time 
for details regarding the fgi facility  see description of indebtedness below and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding with million available under our fgi credit facility  subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances for collateral 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to borrow to the full limit of million if fgi chooses not to finance a portion of our receivables or inventory 
additionally  fgi can cancel the facility at any time 
in may  we issued million of our subordinated convertible notes to a shareholder 
additionally  on july   we closed a public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock and received million in net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we continue to pursue revenue generating opportunities relating to special government mandated retrofit programs in california and potentially others in various jurisdictions domestically and internationally 
opportunities such as these require cash investment in operating expenses and working capital such as inventory and receivables prior to realizing profits and cash from sales 
to address the potential need for capital  in october  we signed a purchase agreement  together with a registration rights agreement  with lpc  whereby lpc has agreed to purchase up to million of our common stock over a month period 
we have registered  shares related to the transaction   shares of which were issued to lpc as a commitment fee   shares may be issued to lpc as an additional commitment fee on a pro rata basis as up to million of our common stock is purchased by lpc  and  represent shares that we may sell to lpc under the purchase agreement 
we have the right  in our sole discretion  over a month period to sell shares of our common stock to lpc in amounts of up to million to up to million per sale  depending on certain conditions as set forth in the purchase agreement  up to the aggregate amount of million 
we currently have registered  shares for purchase shares under the agreement 
the aggregate number of shares issued pursuant to the purchase agreement is limited to  shares of common stock of the outstanding shares of our common stock on october   the date of the purchase agreement the exchange cap  unless and until shareholder approval is obtained 
the exchange cap is not applicable for at market transactions  defined as when the average price for all shares purchased pursuant to the purchase agreement is greater than or equal the signing price per the agreement of plus  or per share 
assuming a purchase price of per share the closing sale price of our common stock on march  and the purchase by lpc of the full  currently registered purchase shares  proceeds to us would be million 
if the purchase was limited to the exchange cap of  shares  proceeds to us would be million 
we expect to use the proceeds received under the purchase agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes 
there have been no sales to date under this arrangement 
in addition  on may   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec the shelf registration 
the shelf registration was declared effective by the sec on may  the shelf registration statement permits us to sell  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million of various securities  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock and units consisting of one or more shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock  warrants  or any combination of such securities 
the registration statement is intended to provide us with additional flexibility to access capital markets for general corporate purposes  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
on july   we entered into a loan commitment letter with kanis sa pursuant to which we issued a promissory note in the principal amount of million 
the promissory note bears interest at per annum which is payable quarterly in arrears and matures on july  see description of indebtedness below and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on january   we and kanis sa entered into an amendment to amend certain terms of our outstanding note due as amended  the maturity date of this note was changed from june  to june  in addition  the payment premium due under this note was changed from a range of  to  based proportionally on the number of days that the loan remains outstanding  to a fixed amount of  with  payable on june  and the remaining  payable at maturity on june  finally  the interest rate was changed from to as of june  also on january   we and kanis sa entered into a letter agreement regarding our outstanding subordinated convertible note due whereby kanis sa has agreed not to accelerate the maturity of these notes during the calendar year 
due to actions taken to improve our liquidity  including the availability with fgi and lpc  as discussed above  management believes that we will have access to sufficient working capital to sustain operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  no assurances can be provided that we will have sufficient cash and credit to sustain operations or that we will  if necessary  be able to raise additional capital or reduce discretionary spending to provide the required liquidity 
in the meantime  we intend to continue to manage our cash in a manner designed to ensure that we have adequate cash to fund our operations for the foreseeable future
