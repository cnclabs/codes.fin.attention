key developments during and previous periods  the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on ashland s current and future cash flows  results of operations and financial position 
business results ashland s overall financial performance decreased by during compared to as adjusted ebitda results declined to  million see us gaap reconciliation on page m 
this decline was due in large part to the operating results in two distinct areas of ashland s businesses 
during  specialty ingredients guar based products business incurred an approximately million decline in gross profit compared to the prior year due to a million loss on the sale of certain higher cost guar inventory purchased in the prior year  lower margins as a result of improved guar supply and reduced customer stocking levels 
the higher cost guar powder products during also caused certain customers during the current year to search for alternative  m lower cost products and to buy directly from suppliers 
secondly  the elastomers business within the performance materials segment reported an approximate million decline in gross profit compared to the strong performance in  as price increases were not sufficient to recover previous margin levels due to the fluctuating price of its key raw material butadiene 
excluding the effect these businesses had on ashland during  the operating results would have increased compared to the prior year period 
acquisitions divestitures during the last several years  ashland has completed the transformation of its overall business into a global specialty chemical company 
much of this transformation has occurred due to significant acquisition and divestiture activity 
the following discussion outlines the key acquisitions and divestitures during  and that contributed to this transformation 
isp acquisition on august   ashland completed its acquisition of isp  a global specialty chemical manufacturer of innovative functional ingredients and technologies  in a transaction valued at billion 
isp reported sales of billion for the twelve months ended september  the purchase price was an all cash transaction  reduced by the amount of isp s net indebtedness at closing 
ashland has included isp within the specialty ingredients reporting segment  with the exception of isp s elastomers business line  a business with million of sales for the twelve months ended september   which has been included within the performance materials reporting segment 
distribution divestiture on march   ashland completed the sale to nexeo solutions  llc nexeo of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of its global distribution business  which previously comprised the ashland distribution distribution segment 
the transaction was an asset sale with total post closing adjusted cash proceeds received by ashland of million  before transaction fees and taxes 
ashland recognized an after tax gain of million during the tax effects on the gain were partially offset by a million release of tax valuation allowances on a capital loss carry forward generated from the december divestiture of ashland s interest in fibervisions holdings llc 
the gain was included within the discontinued operations caption in the statement of consolidated comprehensive income for distribution recorded sales of  million during the fiscal year ended september  and employed approximately  employees across north america and europe 
because this transaction signified ashland s exit from the distribution business  the results of operations and cash flows of distribution have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
certain indirect corporate costs included within selling  general and administrative expense that were previously allocated to the distribution reporting segment that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting classification were reported as costs within the unallocated and other section of continuing operations  and equaled million and million for and  respectively 
ashland has retained and agreed to indemnify nexeo for certain liabilities of the distribution business arising prior to the closing of the sale 
this includes pension and other postretirement benefits  as well as certain other liabilities  including certain litigation and environmental liabilities relating to the pre closing period  as described in the definitive agreement 
costs directly related to these liabilities have been included within the discontinued operations caption for  and the ongoing effects of the pension and postretirement plans for former distribution employees are reported within the unallocated and other section of continuing operations for segment reporting purposes 
as part of this sale  ashland received transition service fees for ongoing administrative and other services provided to nexeo 
during and  ashland recognized transition service fees of million and million  respectively  which offset costs within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated comprehensive income 
while the transition service agreements varied in duration depending upon the type of service provided  ashland implemented plans to reduce costs as the transition services were phased out 
see note d for further information on the results of operations of distribution for all periods presented 
casting solutions joint venture in july  ashland and s d chemie ag s d chemie signed an agreement for the formation of an expanded global joint venture serving the foundry chemical sector 
the transaction closed on november  and combined three businesses i ashland s casting solutions business group  ii s d chemie s foundry products and specialty resins business unit and iii ashland s dchemie kernfest gmbh ask  the then existing owned european based joint venture between ashland and s d chemie  for which ashland historically only recognized equity income of the joint venture within its consolidated results 
upon formation of the expanded global joint venture  ashland used valuation methodologies for certain contributions that primarily consisted of various discounted cash flow models in recording its equity interest at approximately million 
this investment basis was based on the fair value of the net assets of the casting solutions business group as well as the carrying value of ashland s equity interest in ask 
during the fifth year of the joint venture s operations  ashland will have the option to sell its shares in the expanded global joint venture to s d chemie under mutually agreed terms 
if ashland does not execute this option by the end of the sixth year of m the joint venture s operations  s d chemie will have the option to acquire ashland s shares under mutually agreed terms 
under both options  if mutually agreed terms cannot be reached  then the fair market value of the shares will be determined through an appraisal process set forth in the agreement 
ashland s equity interest in the expanded joint venture qualifies for equity method accounting treatment under us gaap 
as a result  beginning on december   the results of the performance materials segment no longer included the sales  cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expense and corresponding taxes related to the casting solutions business  however  ashland includes the financial results of the joint venture within operating income of the performance materials segment and in the equity and other income caption of the statements of consolidated comprehensive income

restructuring and integration programs ashland periodically implements corporate restructuring programs related to acquisitions  divestitures or other cost reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure 
the following highlights the key programs ashland has initiated over the last several years 
severance costs during  ashland announced steps to reduce stranded costs resulting from the divestiture of distribution and the contribution of the casting solutions business to the expanded global joint venture with s d chemie 
targeted cost reductions for the distribution and casting solutions stranded costs were million 
in addition  ashland implemented plans to integrate isp subsequent to its purchase in august targeted synergy cost reductions related to this acquisition were million 
steps to address cost reduction opportunities began with ashland s voluntary severance offer vso in june to approximately  full time  non union  us based employees  primarily within various shared resource groups as well as m certain positions within the specialty ingredients business  which ultimately resulted in employees being formally approved for the vso 
an involuntary program was also initiated in as a further step to capture targeted savings levels from these transactions and other business cost savings initiatives 
the vso and involuntary programs resulted in a severance charge of million during the involuntary program continued during and resulted in an expense of million 
both charges were recognized within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated comprehensive income 
as of september   the remaining restructuring reserve for these and other programs totaled million

this project abandonment resulted in a million charge which primarily related to expenses incurred for engineering and construction in progress 
both charges were recognized within the selling  general and administrative expense caption during as of september   the restructuring reserve for these programs totaled million 
specific business programs in addition to the corporate restructuring programs previously identified  each business periodically initiates its own specific restructuring programs based on smaller scale acquisitions and divestitures within its own business or based on the prevailing economic environment within the markets or industries it serves 
these programs are disclosed by each applicable business in further detail within the business segment discussion section 
stock programs stock repurchase program during  the board of directors of ashland authorized a million common stock repurchase program 
this new authorization replaced ashland s previous million share repurchase authorization 
under the new program  ashland s common shares may be repurchased in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or rule b plans 
this new repurchase program will expire on december  as part of the million common stock repurchase program  ashland announced and completed an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr agreement with citibank  na citibank during under the asr agreement  ashland paid an initial purchase price of million to citibank and received an initial delivery of approximately million shares of its common stock 
the asr agreement had a variable maturity  at citibank s option  with a maximum pricing period termination date of august  in june  citibank exercised its early termination option under the asr agreement and the pricing period was closed 
the settlement price  which represents the weighted average price of ashland s common stock over the pricing period less a discount  was per share 
based on this settlement price  the final number of shares repurchased by ashland that were to be delivered by citibank under the asr agreement was million shares 
ashland received the additional million shares from citibank in june to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased 
in march  the board of directors of ashland approved the million stock repurchase program previously mentioned 
under the program that began on april   ashland purchased common shares through a million b automatic trading plan 
effective may   as a result of the announcement of the pending isp acquisition  ashland terminated the b automatic trading program 
ashland still had the ability to make discretionary purchases of ashland common stock on the open market  pursuant to the board s original million share repurchase authorization 
purchases under the plan amounted to million  or million shares  during ashland did not repurchase any shares during under this program 
stockholder dividends in may  the board of directors of ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to cents per share  per share on an annual basis  to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was paid for quarterly dividends in june and september and was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal m in may  the board of directors of ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to cents per share  cents per share on an annual basis  to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was paid for quarterly dividends in june and september and was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal in may  the board of directors of ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to cents per share  cents per share on an annual basis  to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was paid for quarterly dividends in june and september and was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of fiscal results of operations consolidated review use of non gaap measures ashland has included within this document certain non gaap measures which include ebitda net income  plus income tax expense benefit  net interest and other financing expenses  and depreciation and amortization  adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for discontinued operations  net gain loss on acquisitions and divestitures  other income and expense and key items  which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures  as applicable and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda  which can include pro forma adjustments  divided by sales 
such measurements are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and as related to pro forma adjustments  contain ashland s best estimates of cost allocations and shared resource costs 
management believes the use of non gaap measures on a consolidated and business segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods 
the non gaap information provided is used by ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide a supplemental presentation of ashland s operating performance on a consolidated and business segment basis 
adjusted ebitda generally includes adjustments for unusual  non operational or restructuring related activities 
in addition  certain financial covenants related to ashland s senior credit facility are based on similar non gaap measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric 
in accordance with us gaap  ashland recognizes actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from the estimates used to allocate the change in value of pension and other postretirement benefit plans to expense throughout the year or when assumptions change  as they may each year 
significant factors that can contribute to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses include changes in discount rates used to remeasure pension and other postretirement obligations on an annual basis or upon a qualifying remeasurement  differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and other changes in actuarial assumptions  for example the life expectancy of plan participants 
management believes adjusted ebitda  which includes the expected return on pension plan assets and excludes both the actual return on pension plan assets and the impact of actuarial gains and losses  provides investors with a meaningful supplemental presentation of ashland s operating performance 
management believes these actuarial gains and losses are primarily financing activities that are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global financial markets and in particular interest rates that are not directly related to the underlying business and that do not have an immediate  corresponding impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees and retirees 
for further information on the actuarial assumptions and plan assets referenced above  see md a critical accounting policies employee benefit obligations and note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
ashland has included free cash flow as an additional non gaap metric of cash flow generation 
ashland believes free cash flow is relevant because capital expenditures are an important element of ashland s ongoing cash activities 
by deducting capital expenditures from operating cash flows  ashland is able to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities 
prior to  ashland deducted dividends from this calculation but has discontinued this practice to be more comparable to the broader market s calculation of the term free cash flow 
consolidated review net income ashland s net income amounted to million in  million in and million in  or  and diluted earnings per share  respectively 
ashland s net income is primarily affected by results within operating income  net interest and other financing expense  income taxes  discontinued operations and other significant events or transactions that are unusual or nonrecurring 
operating income includes ashland s adjustment for the immediate recognition of the change in the fair value of the plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans each fiscal year

results of operations business segment review ashland s businesses are managed along four industry segments specialty ingredients  water technologies  performance materials and consumer markets 
results of ashland s business segments are presented based on its management structure and internal accounting practices 
the structure and practices are specific to ashland  therefore  the financial results of ashland s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies 
ashland allocates all costs to its business segments except for certain significant company wide restructuring activities  such as certain restructuring plans described in note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that ashland no longer operates  as well as certain components of pension and other postretirement costs 
ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved  more refined information becomes available and businesses change 
revisions to ashland s methodologies that are deemed insignificant are applied on a prospective basis 
the ebitda and adjusted ebitda amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment 
each of these non gaap measures is defined as follows ebitda operating income plus depreciation and amortization  adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for key items  which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures  as applicable  and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda  which may include pro forma adjustments  divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results 
ashland does not allocate items to each business segment below operating income  such as interest expense and income taxes 
as a result  business segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable us gaap measure 
change in accounting policy regarding pension and other postretirement benefits during  ashland elected to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland elected to immediately recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s historical policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is considered acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change also improved transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  adjusting all periods prior to in connection with this change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s historical policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs only include costs that are directly attributable to current employees 
applying this change in retrospectively  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
m in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation more appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment 
the prior year financial information disclosed in the following tables for each business segment reflects the retrospective application of this expense allocation change 
the following table shows sales  operating income and statistical operating information by business segment for each of the last three years ended september in millions sales specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets operating income loss specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets unallocated and other depreciation and amortization specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets unallocated and other operating information specialty ingredients a b sales per shipping day metric tons sold thousands gross profit as a percent of sales water technologies a sales per shipping day gross profit as a percent of sales performance materials a b sales per shipping day metric tons sold thousands gross profit as a percent of sales consumer markets a lubricant sales gallons premium lubricants percent of us branded volumes gross profit as a percent of sales a sales are defined as sales and operating revenues

the scheduled aggregate maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years are as follows million in  million in  million in  none in and million in debt activity during during  ashland completed its issuance of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of billion 
these senior notes are comprised of senior notes due million  senior notes due million  senior notes due million and senior notes due million 
the notes were issued as additional notes under the existing notes indenture entered into in august  described further below  and have the same terms as the originally issued notes 
the notes were issued at a million premium  while the new notes were issued at a million discount 
in addition  ashland redeemed the remaining million outstanding principal of the senior notes 
during  ashland entered into the senior credit facility  which replaced the billion senior secured revolving credit facility under the senior credit facility 
ashland used the net proceeds from its issuance of the senior notes  along with the initial million borrowing on the senior credit facility and cash on hand  i to pay in full the senior credit facility  including the billion outstanding principal of the term loan a facility and the billion outstanding principal of the term loan b facility  ii to pay million to terminate the interest rate swaps associated with the term loan a and term loan b facilities  iii to pay accrued interest  fees and expenses under the senior credit facility and iv to pay million in fees and expenses with respect to the issuance of the senior notes and entry into the senior credit facility

in conjunction with this tender offer  ashland issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured  unsubordinated notes due the proceeds of the new notes  together with available cash  were used to pay the consideration  accrued and unpaid interest and related fees and expenses in connection with ashland s cash tender offer of the senior notes 
at the close of the tender offer  million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes was redeemed by ashland  representing of the old notes 
in addition  a redemption premium of million was paid to the former note holders 
on august   ashland entered into a million accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to i a sale agreement  among ashland and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries each an originator and collectively  the originators and cvg capital iii llc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the originators cvg and ii a transfer and administration agreement  among cvg  each originator  ashland  as master servicer  certain conduit investors  uncommitted investors  letter of credit issuers  managing agents  administrators and committed investors  and the bank of nova scotia  as agent for various secured parties the agent 
under the sale agreement  each originator will transfer  on an ongoing basis  substantially all of its accounts receivable  certain related assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to cvg 
under the terms of the transfer and administration agreement  cvg may  from time to time  obtain up to million in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of ashland and its subsidiaries from the conduit investors  the uncommitted investors and or the committed investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable  related assets and collections 
the transfer and administration agreement has a term of three years  but is extendable at the discretion of the investors 
ashland accounts for the securitization facility as secured borrowings  and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable 
fundings under the transfer and administration agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected  with new fundings being advanced through daily reinvestments as new accounts receivable are originated by the originators and transferred to cvg  with settlement generally occurring monthly 
ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short term debt instrument within the consolidated balance sheets 
once sold to cvg  the accounts receivable  related assets and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each originator s own assets and m are not available to its creditors should such originator become insolvent 
substantially all of cvg s assets have been pledged to the agent in support of its obligations under the transfer and administration agreement 
at september  and  the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by ashland to cvg was million and million  respectively 
ashland had drawn million and million  respectively  under the facility as of september  and in available funding from qualifying receivables 
funds drawn at the inception of the accounts receivable securitization facility were used to prepay million of principal on ashland s term loan b facility in the weighted average interest rate for this instrument was for and the period issued during debt covenant restrictions the senior credit facility contains usual and customary representations  warranties and affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios  limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  certain negative pledges  investments  mergers  sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations 
as of september   ashland is in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions 
the senior credit facility defines the consolidated leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents to consolidated ebitda covenant adjusted ebitda for any measurement period 
in general  the senior credit facility defines covenant adjusted ebitda as net income plus consolidated interest charges  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  fees and expenses related to capital market transactions  restructuring and integration charges  noncash stock and equity compensation expense  and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period  less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income 
the computation of covenant adjusted ebitda differs from the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda  which have been reconciled previously on page m in general  consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness  banker s acceptances and bank guaranties  deferred purchase price of property or services  attributable indebtedness and guarantees 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the senior credit facility during its entire duration is 
the senior credit facility defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of covenant adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period 
the minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the senior credit facility during its entire duration is

cash projection ashland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations 
these projections are based on various assumptions that include  but are not limited to operational results  working capital cash generation  capital expenditures  pension funding requirements and tax payment and receipts 
based on ashland s current debt structure included in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements  future annual interest expense is expected to range from approximately million to million based on applicable fixed and floating interest rates  assuming interest rates remain stable 
stockholders equity stockholders equity increased million since september  to  million at september  this increase was primarily due to net income during the period of million as well as the recognition of previous unrealized losses of million associated with ashland s terminated interest rate swaps  deferred translation gains of million and million in common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans  partially offset by million in common stock repurchased  regular cash dividends of million and adjustments to pension and postretirement obligations of million 
stock repurchase program during  the board of directors of ashland authorized a million common stock repurchase program 
this new authorization replaced ashland s previous million share repurchase authorization 
under the new program  ashland s common shares may be repurchased in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or rule b plans 
this new repurchase program will expire on december  m as part of the million common stock repurchase program  ashland announced and completed the asr agreement with citibank during under the asr agreement  ashland paid an initial purchase price of million to citibank and received an initial delivery of approximately million shares of its common stock 
the asr agreement had a variable maturity  at citibank s option  with a maximum pricing period termination date of august  in june  citibank exercised its early termination option under the asr agreement and the pricing period was closed 
the settlement price  which represents the weighted average price of ashland s common stock over the pricing period less a discount  was per share 
based on this settlement price  the final number of shares repurchased by ashland that were to be delivered by citibank under the asr agreement was million shares 
ashland received the additional million shares from citibank in june to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of shares repurchased 
in march  the board of directors of ashland approved the million stock repurchase program previously mentioned 
under the program that began on april   ashland purchased common shares through a million b automatic trading plan 
effective may   as a result of the announcement of the pending isp acquisition  ashland terminated the b automatic trading program 
ashland still had the ability to make discretionary purchases of ashland common stock on the open market  pursuant to the board s original million share repurchase authorization 
purchases under the plan amounted to million  or million shares  during ashland did not repurchase any shares during under this program

e includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments 
variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of september  f due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities  ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties 
therefore  these amounts were included in the more than years column 
g ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on ashland  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
m critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets tangible assets the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings are depreciated principally over to years and machinery and equipment principally over to years 
ashland reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
total depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation expense for  and included million  million and million  respectively  in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation 
capitalized interest for  and was million 
finite lived intangible assets finite lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names  intellectual property  customer relationships and sales contracts 
these intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over to years  intellectual property over to years  customer relationships over to years and other intangibles over to years 
ashland reviews finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
amortization expense recognized on finite lived intangible assets was million for  million for and million for  and is primarily included in the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated comprehensive income 
goodwill in accordance with us gaap  ashland reviews goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment either annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
this annual assessment is performed as of july and consists of ashland determining each reporting unit s current fair value compared to its current carrying value 
ashland has determined that its reporting units for allocation of goodwill include the specialty ingredients  water technologies  consumer markets and performance materials segments 
within the performance materials reportable segment  because further discrete financial information is provided and management regularly reviews this information  this reportable segment is further broken down into the composites and adhesives and elastomers reporting units 
goodwill associated with each of these reporting units as of september  was  million for specialty ingredients  million for water technologies  million for consumer markets  million for composites and adhesives and million for elastomers 
m when externally quoted market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units through the use of a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting unit s industry peer group 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions 
significant assumptions ashland utilized in these models for the current year included projected business results and future industry direction  long term growth factors ranging from to and weighted average cost of capital ranging from to 
ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to ashland s market capitalization  and implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of goodwill  ashland s valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment 
each reporting unit s fair value was significantly over its carrying values  except for the specialty ingredients and elastomers reporting units  whose calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model of the specialty ingredients reporting unit  a negative change in the long term growth factor or a negative change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have resulted in a fair value slightly below the current carrying value 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model of the elastomers reporting unit  a negative change in the long term growth factor assumption would have resulted in a fair value still above the current carrying value  while a negative change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have resulted in a fair value slightly below the current carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of specialty ingredients within the model  ashland reaffirmed its historical assumptions for the long term growth factor of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
for elastomers  ashland reaffirmed its historical assumptions for the long term growth factor of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
the weighted average costs of capital of and are considered by ashland to be conservative based on ashland s significantly lower overall weighted average borrowing rate during of as well as the general overall lower interest rate environment that currently exists in the credit markets 
assuming no changes in the key assumptions identified and projected results  ashland currently anticipates the future fair value of both the specialty ingredients and elastomers reporting units to increase over time  however  future declines in the operating results of either reporting unit could indicate a need to reevaluate the fair value of these businesses under us gaap requirements and may ultimately result in an impairment to goodwill 
ashland continues to monitor for any potential indicators of impairment 
ashland compared and assessed the total fair values of the reporting units to ashland s market capitalization at the annual assessment date  including the implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
the calculated fair value for each reporting unit summed together exceeded ashland s market value as of the annual impairment testing date for by approximately  which ashland considers reasonable 
because the fair value results for each reporting unit did not indicate a potential impairment existed  ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and subsequent to this annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
other indefinite lived intangible assets other indefinite lived intangible assets include in process research and development ipr d and certain trademarks and trade names 
these assets had a carrying value of million as of september  ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
ashland tests these assets using a relief from royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value  except for ipr d assets  which are described within its section 
significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include  but are not limited to  such estimates as projected business results  growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to  and royalty rates ranging from to 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets  ashland s models did not indicate any impairment  as each indefinite lived intangible asset s fair value exceeded their carrying values 
ashland s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives  including goodwill  could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit a significant change in projected business results  a divestiture decision  increase in ashland s weighted average cost of capital rates  decrease in growth rates or other assumptions  economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated  or another significant economic event

ipr d ashland has identified in process research and development ipr d projects within the acquired isp business that  as of the date of acquisition  had not been established in the marketplace 
these projects consist of various enhancements of existing products or new potential applications for products 
ashland used various valuation models based on discounted probability weighted future cash flows on a project by project basis in identifying projects as distinct assets 
during  ashland finalized m its strategic assessment and evaluation of these projects 
as of september   ashland recorded the value of these projects as million 
since ashland had not been given the opportunity to fully investigate each ipr d project before the acquisition was completed  the newly appointed management team completed its assessment of each ongoing ipr d project from isp during the fourth quarter of this resulted in an adjustment to the initially recorded value  reducing the fair value assigned to ipr d projects to million  with a corresponding increase to goodwill 
additionally as a part of this assessment  ashland identified several projects that were abandoned during due to ongoing research and development activities that occurred subsequent to the acquisition of isp 
ashland s abandonment of these projects based on post acquisition events resulted in a million impairment charge during  classified within the research and development expense caption of the statement of consolidated comprehensive income 
the completion of this strategic assessment resulted in projects identified as distinct assets that totaled million as of september  identified ipr d acquired in a business combination is capitalized and tested for impairment annually and when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
as a result  the remaining projects were assessed throughout  with ashland decreasing the assets by million for projects abandoned or impaired during the year 
as of september   five ipr d projects remain as assets for million 
these assets will continue to be subjected to future impairment or amortization as the individual projects continue through the various stages of the feasibility assessment process 
the future feasibility of these assets will be evaluated on a quarterly basis by ashland or when a significant event has been deemed to have occurred

previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland elected to immediately recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s historical policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is considered acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change also improved transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  adjusting all periods prior to the following table discloses the components of the actuarial gain or loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements for each of the last three years 
m in millions actuarial gain loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement change in discount rate and other actuarial assumptions a actual return on plan assets a expected return on plan assets a total actuarial gain loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement less actuarial gain recognized in discontinued operations total actuarial gain loss on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurement from continuing operations a for additional information on key assumptions and actual plan asset performance in each year  see the actuarial assumptions discussion within this section 
change in expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in connection with this change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s historical policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs only include costs that are directly attributable to current employees 
applying this change in retrospectively  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation more appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment 
actuarial assumptions ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to spot rates determined from an actuarial developed yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds 
during  ashland elected to use the above mean yield curve  a change from the yield curve used in prior years 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rates determined as of september  ranged from for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
under the prior yield curve  the september  discount rates would have ranged from for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
m the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  and the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be for  for and for the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be for and for and for  the pension plan assets generated an actual weighted average return of  compared to in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans will be for however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland estimates total fiscal pension expense for us and us pension plans to be approximately million  which excludes the impact of actuarial gains or losses 
the following table discloses the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate us pension legislation and future funding requirements in july  the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map was enacted in the us and  in part  provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of specifically  map allows for the use of a year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years  as was previously required 
this relief will impact ashland s future required funding contributions to its us qualified pension plans 
reflecting the impact of this law  ashland expects to contribute approximately million to its us pension plans and approximately million to its non us pension plans during income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and deferred taxes 
under us gaap  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
with the exception of certain investments in which ashland has an ownership percentage of or less  ashland asserted in the quarter ended june  that all other foreign earnings would be prospectively indefinitely reinvested 
ashland has previously accrued us tax for certain historical earnings where the permanent reinvestment assertion was not made and will continue to monitor the assertion related to future earnings based upon cash requirements within and outside the us in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from ashland s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the statement of consolidated comprehensive income and consolidated balance sheet 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by ashland 
if actual results differ from the estimates made by ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset 
additionally  the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred m tax assets  which includes such evidence as historical earnings  projected future earnings  tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences 
in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities other than those with an indefinite reversal period  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative income or loss 
in addition  ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
as a result of the isp and hercules acquisitions during and  respectively  significant historical tax positions and structures related to isp and hercules continue to be combined within ashland 
some of these previous tax positions and structures from isp and hercules required a complete reassessment regarding certain of ashland s pre acquisition tax positions and structures 
as such  material changes in certain tax matters may occur in the future based on deviations from ashland s current estimates and assumptions in combining these tax positions and structures

asbestos litigation ashland and hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland that was acquired in  have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions  ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims and litigation defense 
the claim experience of ashland and hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
changes in asbestos related liabilities and receivables are recorded on an after tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ashland asbestos related litigation the claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
ashland asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent update  completed during  it was determined that the liability for ashland asbestos claims should be decreased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  ashland asbestos related receivables ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  any increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
for the ashland asbestos related obligations  ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  all of which have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best  as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  whose insurance policy obligations have been transferred to a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway 
ashland discounts this portion of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers unless likely settlement amounts can be determined 
m during  ashland received million in cash after reaching a settlement with certain insolvent london market insurance companies 
the cash received from this settlement during the current period was recognized as an after tax gain of million within discontinued operations of the statement of consolidated comprehensive income since ashland s policy is to not record asbestos receivables for any carriers that are insolvent until cash is received 
in october  ashland initiated arbitration proceedings against underwriters at lloyd s and certain chartis aig member companies seeking to enforce these insurers contractual obligations to provide indemnity for asbestos liabilities and defense costs under existing coverage in place agreements 
in addition  ashland has initiated a lawsuit in kentucky state court against certain berkshire hathaway entities national indemnity company and resolute management inc on grounds that these berkshire entities have wrongfully interfered with underwriters and chartis performance of their respective contractual obligations to provide asbestos coverage by directing the insurers to reduce and delay certain claim payments 
while ashland anticipates its position will be supported by the proceedings  an adverse resolution of these proceedings could have a significant effect on the timing of loss reimbursement and the amount of ashland s recorded insurance receivables from these insurers 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million excluding the hercules receivable for asbestos claims  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers  was updated 
this model update resulted in a million decrease in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
hercules asbestos related litigation hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland acquired during  has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market 
the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
hercules asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent annual update of this estimate  completed during  it was determined that the liability for hercules asbestos related claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  hercules asbestos related receivables for the hercules asbestos related obligations  certain coverage in place agreements with insurance carriers exist 
as a result  any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially offset by probable insurance recoveries 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
as of september   this estimated receivable consists exclusively of domestic insurers  all of which have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best 
as of september  and  the receivables from insurers amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was updated 
this model update caused a million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
asbestos litigation cost projection projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for ashland and hercules represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models was developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has m currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately to year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately million for the ashland asbestos related litigation and approximately million for the hercules asbestos related litigation or approximately billion in the aggregate  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering  technical and feasibility studies are used  along with historical experience and other factors  to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and  ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million 
environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material  as the largest reserve for any site is approximately or less of the remediation reserve 
outlook for the first quarter of  ashland expects volumes to be flat as compared to the prior year s quarter and consistent with normal seasonality 
regionally  ashland s expectations are mixed  as business results were the strongest within north america and asia during ashland expects growth in north america to remain slow but stable to start the fiscal year 
each business in asia experienced fourth quarter year over year volume gains  and ashland expects continued volume growth in asia in the business performance in europe was weak during  and ashland continues to be cautious within this uncertain market 
the results in latin america have been  and are expected to continue to be  inconsistent during the next fiscal year 
during november  ashland announced several strategic actions 
first  ashland completed its strategic alternative review of water technologies with the board of directors and announced that a formal sale process is currently ongoing for this business 
ashland expects to announce during the first quarter of calendar that it has entered into separate agreements to sell both water technologies and the elastomers business within performance materials 
ashland currently anticipates the primary use of net proceeds from these two asset sales to be a return of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases 
second  to align the cost structure to an expected slower growth environment  as well as to continue to enhance ashland s competitive position and maximize operational efficiencies  the company announced a global restructuring program that is expected to reduce costs by million to million once fully implemented during the next to months 
lastly  with respect to ashland s overall corporate strategy  management and the board of directors will continue to review the company s portfolio of businesses in order to best position the company for value creation 
the collective intent of these strategic actions is to position ashland for sustainable sales and earnings growth  with ebitda margins that rank among the top quartile of specialty chemical companies 
m effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
as of september   ashland s monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the united states in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs during inflationary periods 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements made under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of ashland has identified some of these forward looking statements with words such as anticipates  believes  expects  estimates  is likely  predicts  projects  forecasts  may  will  should and intends and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology 
in addition  ashland may from time to time make forward looking statements in its annual report to shareholders  quarterly reports and other filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases and other written and oral communications 
these forward looking statements are based on ashland s expectations and assumptions  as of the date such statements are made  regarding ashland s future operating performance and financial condition  the economy and other future events or circumstances 
ashland s expectations and assumptions include  without limitation  those mentioned within the md a  internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  operating efficiencies and economic conditions such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  and the ability to recover raw material cost increases through price increases  and risks and uncertainties associated with the following ashland s substantial indebtedness including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect ashland s future cash flows  results of operations  financial condition and its ability to repay debt  the potential sale transactions involving ashland water technologies and the elastomers business including the possibility that one or both transactions may not occur or that  if a transaction does occur  ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transaction  ashland s ability to generate sufficient cash to finance its stock repurchase plans  severe weather  natural disasters  and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated  projected or implied by any forward looking statements  including  without limitation  risks and uncertainties affecting ashland that are contained in use of estimates  risks and uncertainties in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k

ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update any forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or otherwise except as required by securities or other applicable law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative m contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on ashland s open foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would be a million impact on ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
ashland did not transact or have open any hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements for the year ended september  during  ashland entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with term loans a and b that were borrowed in conjunction with the isp acquisition 
as of september   the notional values of the interest rate swaps associated with term loan a and term loan b equaled billion and million  respectively 
these instruments qualified for hedge accounting treatment and were designated as cash flow hedges whereby ashland recorded these hedges at fair value  with the effective portion of the gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income when the hedged item affected net income 
the fair value of ashland s interest rate swap assets and liabilities were calculated using standard pricing models 
these models utilized inputs derived from observable market data such as interest rate spot rates and forward rates  and were deemed to be level measurements within the fair value hierarchy 
counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements were highly rated financial institutions which ashland believed carry only a minimal risk of nonperformance 
ashland terminated the interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with the repayment of term loans a and b during  resulting in a charge of million included in the net interest and other financing expense caption of the statement of consolidated comprehensive income for see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 
as of september   ashland does not have any instrument that qualified for hedge accounting treatment
