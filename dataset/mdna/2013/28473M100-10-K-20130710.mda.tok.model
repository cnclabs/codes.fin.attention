we cannot ensure that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the manufacture of production units of electronic assemblies  liquid crystal displays  and our proprietary products including our remote monitoring equipment  rfid technology and solutions and our mobile computing products 
we also derive revenue from repairs and non warranty services  engineering design services  remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts 
production and repaired units are billed to the customer after they are shipped 
remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month the services or maintenance periods are completed 
for customers that utilize our engineering design services  we bill the customer and recognize revenue after the design services or tooling have been completed 
we require our customers to provide a binding purchase order to verify the manufacturing services to be provided and to ensure payment 
typically  we do not have any post shipment obligations  including customer acceptance requirements 
we do provide training and installation services to our customers and those services are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month the services are completed 
revenue recognized is net of sales taxes  tariffs  or duties remitted to any governmental authority 
inventory valuation 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or fair value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as other market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our quarterly reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we review our inventory in detail on a quarterly basis utilizing multiple annual time horizons ranging from months to months 
individual part numbers that have not been used within each of the time horizons are examined by manufacturing personnel for obsolescence  excess and fair value 
parts that are not identified for common use or are unique to a former customer or application are categorized as obsolete and are allowed for as part of our quarterly inventory write down 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history  and current economic conditions 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the majority of the customer accounts are considered past due after the invoice becomes older than the customer s credit terms days for the majority of customers 
interest is not charged on past due accounts for the majority of our customers 
warranty reserve 
we have established a warranty reserve for rework  product warranties and customer refunds 
we provide a limited warranty for a period of one year from the date of receipt of our products by our customers  or one year from installation for some of our products 
our customers may also elect to purchase an extended warranty 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer or refund the customer s purchase price 
the warranty reserve is based on historical experience and analysis of specific known and potential warranty issues 
the product warranty liability reflects management s best estimate of probable liability under our product warranties 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill  but rather review our carrying value for impairment annually january  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step is to identify whether potential impairment of goodwill exists by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value  as determined by its estimated cash flows 
if impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  copyrights  customer relationships  and capitalized software 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the useful lives of the intangible assets range from years 
impairment of long lived intangible assets 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we would recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets and intangibles
