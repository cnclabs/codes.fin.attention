the decline in volume based carrier bonus payments has a direct negative impact on gross margin  since there are no corresponding expenses associated with these revenues 
in addition  the decrease in operating revenues in both the employee benefits and property casualty businesses played a role in the margin decline  despite a corresponding savings in variable sales commissions 
these were offset  in part  by an increase from retirement advisory and human capital advisory revenues 
asset based revenues do not have related direct costs  and human capital advisory revenues have a more fixed cost structure  therefore  growth in those revenues has a favorable impact on gross margin

cbiz supplements net operating cash with a million unsecured credit facility and million in notes 
cbiz maintains a million unsecured credit facility with bank of america as agent bank for a group of seven participating banks 
the credit facility also has a letter of credit sub facility 
on april   the credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date one year to june  reduce interest on outstanding balances  reduce commitment fees on the unused borrowing limit  and adjust the leverage ratio limits to provide cbiz with more flexibility 
on august   the credit facility was further amended to modify the senior and total leverage requirements and provide a temporary increase in the leverage ratios for twelve months  at which time the leverage ratios will step down to the leverage schedule prescribed by the amendment

the above table does not reflect million of unrecognized tax benefits  which the company has recorded for uncertain tax positions as cbiz is unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains asa s with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business financial services and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which qualify as variable 
table of contents interest entities 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the operations or accounts of variable interest entities as the impact is not material to the consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz 
cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an asa 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million at december  and in addition  cbiz provides license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of license bonds outstanding was million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has various agreements under which the company may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which the company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively mitigate cbiz s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of the floating rate debt under the credit facility  to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december  and  cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million will expire in june and the remaining million will expire in june management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
cbiz does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cbiz carries million in notes bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the notes mature on october  and may not be converted before july  cbiz believes the fixed nature of these borrowings mitigate its interest rate risk 
in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in accordance with the company s investment policy  which requires that all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment 
the interest income on these investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility are based on market conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements 
cbiz s management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the policies discussed below address the most critical accounting policies which are the most important to the portrayal of cbiz s financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract terms are typically contained in a signed agreement with the client or when applicable  other third parties which generally defines the scope of services to be provided  pricing of services  and payment terms generally ranging from invoice date to days after invoice date 
billing may occur prior to  during  or upon completion of the service 
cbiz typically does not have acceptance provisions or right of refund arrangements included in these agreements 
contract terms vary depending on the scope of services provided  the deliverables  and the complexity of the engagement 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided in more detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable management determines the valuation of accounts receivable including unbilled accounts receivable and notes receivable  and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to the respective receivable balance 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectability of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts for each accounting period 
material differences may result if facts and circumstances change in relation to the original estimation 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment testing may be performed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of and  cbiz applied the principles as prescribed in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu in order to complete its goodwill impairment tests 
in accordance with asu  cbiz based its goodwill impairment testing on a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units that carried a goodwill balance 
the qualitative assessment included an in depth analysis of many factors  including general economic conditions  industry and market conditions  a broad scope of financial factors  the company s weighted average cost of capital  changes in management and key personnel  the price of the company s common stock  as well as other drivers of a fair value analysis 
as part of the qualitative analysis  many estimates and assumptions were made that related to future economic trends  
table of contents client behaviors  and other factors  all of which are beyond the control of management 
as a result of the company s qualitative assessment  it was concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying value 
long lived assets long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets  which include client lists and non compete agreements 
the intangible assets are amortized over their expected periods of benefit  which generally ranges from two to fifteen years 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or groups of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis or market comparable method 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation is unable to be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to the company s quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
in addition  reserves are established for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
see note and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
circumstances that could cause cbiz s estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as cbiz prepares its corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions and valuation allowances taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of management judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above  are also critical in understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issue accounting standards update asu no 
asu comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income  but it does require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component  as well as require the presentation of these amounts on the face of the statements of comprehensive income or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asu will be effective for the reporting periods beginning after december  cbiz is currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu  but currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by bank of america  na  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
cbiz s balance outstanding under its credit facility at december  was million 
if market rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively modify the company s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of its floating rate debt under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million will expire in june and the remaining million will expire in june management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding interest rate swaps 
in connection with cbiz s payroll business  funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  such as corporate and municipal bonds 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment 
at each respective balance sheet date  these investments are adjusted to fair value with fair value adjustments being recorded to other comprehensive income or loss for the respective period 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these investments and the related fair value assessments
