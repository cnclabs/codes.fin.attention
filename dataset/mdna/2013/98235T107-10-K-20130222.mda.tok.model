significant business developments 
net sales declined in  totaling million  compared to million in  as growth in our foot and ankle business was more than offset by declines in our other product lines 

table of contents our domestic sales declined  as a increase in our us foot and ankle sales was more than offset by a decline in our orthorecon segment  which was negatively affected by customer losses associated with distributor transitions and challenges associated with implementing enhancements to our compliance processes 
in addition  our us biologics sales decreased due in part to the impact of our agreement with kinetic concepts  inc kci where we licensed our graftjacket brand to kci for exclusive use in wound markets  which precluded us from marketing our graftjacket products in the wound care field beginning july  our international sales decreased by during as compared to driven primarily by pricing decreases in japan and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
in  net income totaled million  compared to a net loss of million in items favorably impacting net income in as compared to included a million million net of taxes decrease in restructuring charges  a million million net of taxes gain on the sale of certain internally developed intellectual property recognized during  a million million net of taxes provision for product liability associated with modular necks recognized during  and a million million net of taxes decrease in expenses associated with the deferred prosecution agreement and us governmental inquiries 
items unfavorably impacting net income in included charges of million million net of taxes associated with transitioning a major portion of our us independent distributor foot and ankle territories to direct employee sales representation  charges of million million net of taxes associated with the issuance of our convertible senior notes and termination of our amended and restated revolving credit agreement senior credit facility  and decreased profitability in our orthorecon segment  primarily driven by sales declines 
during  we converted a major portion of our us foot and ankle distributor territories to direct sales representation 
we believe this increase in us direct foot and ankle sales representation  coupled with our large and growing product portfolio and increased investment in medical education  will enable us to continue improving our growth rates in foot and ankle 
in conjunction with our us foot and ankle sales force conversions  we entered into agreements with certain distributors  which included non compete clauses 
as a result  we recorded million of non compete intangible assets and recognized million of associated amortization expenses 
additionally we recorded million of expenses related to this conversion during we will recognize amortization expense related to these conversions over the next two years  which will have a negative impact on our profitability 
in august  we issued million of convertible senior notes notes  which generated net proceeds of million 
we used million of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay the million under a delayed draw term loan term loan under our senior credit facility and to terminate the senior credit facility 
in connection with the offering of the notes  we entered into convertible note hedging transactions with three counterparties the option counterparties 
we also entered into warrant transactions in which we sold warrants for an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to the option counterparties 
we paid the option counterparties approximately million for the convertible note hedge and received approximately million from the option counterparties for the warrants 
see notes and for additional information regarding these transactions 
we used million of the proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repurchase a portion of outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes notes 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of the notes remain outstanding 
our deferred prosecution agreement dpa expired on september  on october   we received notice that the united states attorney office usao dismissed the pending criminal complaint filed in september against us 
upon the expiration of the dpa  our amended corporate integrity agreement cia became effective 
see additional discussion of our dpa and cia in significant industry factors 
in november  we announced that pascal er girin was named executive vice president and chief operating officer 
mr 
girin has global responsibility for our extremities and orthorecon businesses  and clinical  regulatory and quality 
in addition  we announced a new divisional structure  whereby we created an extremities division and an orthorecon division 
eric stookey  formerly our chief commercial officer  was promoted to president of our extremities division and ted davis  formerly our senior vice president of corporate development  was promoted to president of our orthorecon division 
in november  we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with biomimetic for a business combination of wright and biomimetic 
biomimetic is focused on developing regenerative medicine products to promote the healing of 
table of contents musculoskeletal injuries and diseases with a novel protein therapeutic product  augment bone graft  under late stage fda review as a replacement for autologous bone graft in foot and ankle fusions 
the transaction will combine biomimetic breakthrough biologics platform and pipeline with our established sales force and product portfolio  to further accelerate growth in our extremities business 
under the terms of the agreement  the transaction has a total potential value for biomimetic shareholders of million  based on our closing stock price on november   including an upfront payment of in cash and shares of wright common stock per share of biomimetic stock  valued at approximately million 
each biomimetic share will also receive one tradable contingent value right cvr  which entitles its holder to receive additional cash payments of up to per share  which are payable upon receipt of fda approval of augment bone graft and upon achieving certain revenue milestones 
we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions  including biomimetic shareholder approval 
a biomimetic shareholder vote is scheduled for february  opportunities and challenges 
we believe that we have an opportunity to transform our business to increase our foot and ankle revenue growth rates  stabilize our orthorecon business  and increase our cash generation through significant reduction of our inventories 
we made changes in to realize these opportunities  including aggressively converting a portion of our us independent distributor foot and ankle territories to direct sales representation  substantially increasing our investment in foot and ankle medical education to drive market adoption of new products and technologies  and implementing steps to significantly reduce inventories over the next several years 
as a result  our foot and ankle business grew compared to and we generated million of free cash flow during as we move into  we expect to build on this momentum with new initiatives to increase sales productivity by reducing non revenue generating activities  improve gross margins and stabilize our orthorecon business 
our us orthorecon business will continue to be unfavorably affected by the full year impact of customer losses and revenue dis synergies associated with our us foot and ankle sales force conversion in our international orthorecon businesses will be negatively impacted by the full year impact of japan pricing declines 
beginning in  we will be subject to a excise tax on us sales of medical devices  as prescribed in the affordable care act 
this tax will have a negative impact on our profitability 
significant industry factors 
our industry is affected by numerous competitive  regulatory  and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and has recently experienced increased pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joint devices 
in december  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj through the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao requesting documents for the period january through the present related to any consulting and professional service agreements with orthopaedic surgeons in connection with hip or knee joint replacement procedures or products 
this subpoena was served shortly after several of our knee and hip competitors agreed with the doj to resolutions of similar investigations 
on september   wmt  entered into a month deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the usao and a civil settlement agreement csa with the united states 
under the dpa  the usao filed a criminal complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey charging wmt with conspiracy to commit violations of the anti kickback statute usc a b during the years through the court deferred prosecution of the criminal complaint during the term of the dpa and the usao agreed that if wmt complied with the dpa provisions  the usao would seek dismissal of the criminal complaint 
pursuant to the csa  wmt settled civil and administrative claims relating to the matter for a payment of million without any admission by wmt 
in conjunction with the csa  wmt also entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health and human services oig hhs 
pursuant to the dpa  an independent monitor reviewed and evaluated wmt s compliance with its obligations under the dpa 
the dpa and the cia were filed as exhibits and  respectively  to our current report on form k filed on september  the dpa was also posted to our website 
each of the dpa and the cia could be modified by mutual consent of the parties thereto 
on september   wmt reached an agreement with the usao and the oig hhs under which wmt voluntarily agreed to extend the term of its dpa for months  to september  on september   wmt also agreed with the oig hhs to an amendment to the cia under which certain of wmt substantive obligations under the cia would begin on september   when the amended dpa monitoring period expired 
the term of the cia has not changed  and will expire as previously provided on september  
table of contents on october   the usao issued a press release announcing that the amended dpa had expired on september   that it had moved to dismiss the criminal complaint against wmt because wmt had fully complied with the terms of the dpa  and that the court had ordered dismissal of the complaint on october  the dpa imposed  and the cia continues to impose  certain obligations on wmt to maintain compliance with us healthcare laws  regulations and other requirements 
our failure to do so could expose us to significant liability including  but not limited to  exclusion from federal healthcare program participation  including medicaid and medicare  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  potential prosecution  civil and criminal fines or penalties  and additional litigation cost and expense 
in addition to the usao and oig hhs  other governmental agencies  including state authorities  could conduct investigations or institute proceedings that are not precluded by the terms of the settlements reflected in the dpa and the cia 
in addition  the settlement with the usao and oig hhs could increase our exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers  including under the federal false claims acts  based on new theories or allegations arising from the allegations made by the usao 
the costs of defending or resolving any such investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the successful implementation of our enhanced compliance program requires the full and sustained cooperation of our employees  distributors  and sales agents as well as the healthcare professionals with whom they interact 
these efforts may require increased expenses and additional investments 
we may also encounter inefficiencies in the implementation of our new compliance enhancements  including delays in medical education  research and development projects  and clinical studies  which may unfavorably impact our business and our relationships with customers 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in risk factors 
we market metal on metal hip mom arthroplasty systems 
on june and june   fda orthopaedic and rehabilitation devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee met and discussed the safety and effectiveness of mom hip arthroplasty systems 
fda sought expert scientific and clinical opinion on the risks and benefits of mom hip arthroplasty systems from the committee and the public 
in january  the fda proposed a new regulation requiring that all mom hip implants undergo the full pma process  with supportive clinical data 
this regulation applies to currently marketed devices  as well as those entering the market for the first time 
fda has not provided a date for final implementation and enforcement of this new requirement

on february   we entered into a senior credit facility 
in march  to fund the purchase of the notes  we borrowed million under the term loan facility available under our senior credit facility 
the term loan bears interest at a one month libor  plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the senior credit facility 
on august   we used million of proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay the term loan and terminated our senior credit facility 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  which we designated as a cash flow hedge of the underlying variable rate obligation on our term loan 
the swap was terminated on august   and we paid approximately million for the loss on the early termination 
as of december   we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents held in jurisdictions outside of the us  which are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences 
we do not intend to repatriate these funds

in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
contingent consideration of up to  may be paid related to the acquisition of certain assets associated with the ez concept surgical device corporation ez frame 
the potential additional cash payments are based on the future financial performance of the acquired assets 
additionally  in accordance with the october cci acquisition  we will pay royalties based on sales of the acquired product 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our us sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales 
a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to royalties earned based on product sales 
additionally  as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on us and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 
certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  
table of contents our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million and our marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  and meet our contractual cash obligations in  including the upfront cash payment of approximately million upon the successful closing of our acquisition of biomimetic 
critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and surgery centers and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of employee and independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals and surgery centers when they take title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations  we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately million and million of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately million and million are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
in  we entered into a trademark license agreement license agreement with kci medical resources  a subsidiary of kinetic concepts  inc kci 
in exchange for million  of which million was received immediately and million was received in january  the license agreement provides kci with a non transferable license to use our trademarks associated with our graftjacket line of products in connection with the marketing and distribution of kci soft tissue graft containment products used in the wound care field  subject to certain exceptions 
license revenue is being recognized over years on a straight line basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience credit losses on our accounts receivable and accordingly  we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  we have experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital 
table of contents customers and more significant bad debts from certain international stocking distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continued collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically appropriate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately not collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly  which would necessitate additional allowances in future periods 
our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out fifo basis or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units using projections of future cash flows 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  the annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter 
as a result of our change in reportable segments during the first quarter of  which also resulted in a change in reporting units for goodwill impairment measurement purposes  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of march  during the second quarter of  we completed this goodwill impairment analysis and determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values  indicating that goodwill had not been impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment and determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our orthorecon and extremities reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values  indicating that goodwill was not impaired 
as of december   there was goodwill of approximately million and million for our orthorecon and extremities reporting units  respectively 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of finite  long lived assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc section  property  plant and equipment fasb asc 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation and amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  if we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on the asset s fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims  product liability insurance recoveries and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
in the third quarter of  as a result of an increase in the number and monetary amount of claims associated with fractures of our long profemur titanium modular necks profemur claims  management recorded a provision for current and future claims associated with fractures of this product 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further description of this provision 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of 
table of contents accrued product liabilities  and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for profemur claims was million as of both december  and december  we maintain insurance coverage  and we have therefore recorded an estimate of the probable recovery of our accrual for profemur claims of approximately million and million related to open claims as of december  and december   respectively 
our accrual for other product liability claims was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
claims for personal injury have also been made against us associated with our metal on metal hip products 
we are currently accounting for these claims in accordance with our standard product liability accrual methodology on a case by case basis 
we have maintained product liability insurance coverage on a claims made basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further description of our insurance coverage 
during the third quarter of  we received a customary reservation of rights from our primary product liability insurance carrier asserting that certain present and future claims related to our conserve metal on metal hip products and which allege certain types of injury hereafter conserve claims would be covered under the policy year the first such claim was asserted 
the effect of this coverage position would be to place conserve claims into a single prior policy year in which applicable claims made coverage was available  subject to the overall policy limits then in effect 
management agrees that there is insurance coverage for the conserve claims  but has notified the carrier that at this time it disputes the carrier selection of available policy years 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a receivable of approximately million for the probable insurance recovery of spending to date in excess of our aggregate retention in certain claim years 
this spending primarily relates to defense and settlement costs associated with profemur claims and defense costs associated with conserve claims 
if our primary carrier were to assert that profemur claims fall under the policy year the first such claim was made  ie  the same position as has been asserted for conserve claims  then we would expect to recognize an additional insurance receivable and recover certain previously recorded defense and settlement costs 
we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss can be developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance balances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carryforward of certain tax basis net operating losses and general business tax credits 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january   which requires the tax effects of an income tax position to be recognized only if they are more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  income taxes 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions  and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we calculate the grant date fair value of non vested shares as the closing sales price on the trading day immediately prior to the grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of these stock based payment awards on the date 
table of contents of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected life of options evaluating the historical activity as required by fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  such stock based compensation expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
a change in assumptions may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our stock based compensation disclosures 
acquisition method accounting 
in accordance with fasb asc section  business combinations fasb asc  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value 
legal fees and other transaction related costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
fasb asc also requires acquirers  among other things  to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expects  but is not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition 
restructuring charges 
we evaluate impairment issues for long lived assets under the provisions of fasb asc we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc section  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time termination benefit arrangements and other costs associated with exit activities are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc section  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we estimated the expense for our restructuring initiatives by accumulating detailed estimates of costs  including the estimated costs of employee severance and related termination benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases and any other qualifying exit costs 
such costs represented management s best estimates  which were evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment was required 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our restructuring disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the interest rates associated with our invested cash balances 
on december   we have invested short term cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
we believe that a basis point change in interest rates is reasonably possible in the near term 
based on our current level of investment  an increase or decrease of basis points in interest rates would have an annual impact of approximately  to our interest income 
equity price risk our convertible notes includes conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes 
in addition  the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock 
the amount of cash we may be required to pay  or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes  is determined by the price of our common stock 
the amount of cash that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 
upon the expiration of our warrants  we will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of at that time 
the following table shows the number of shares that we would issue to warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants assuming various closing stock prices on the date of warrant expiration stock price shares in thousands greater than strike price greater than strike price greater than strike price greater than strike price greater than strike price foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure 
for sales not denominated in us dollars  an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and our competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries  which are denominated in the euro  from japan  which are denominated in the japanese yen  from the united kingdom  which are denominated in the british pound  and from canada  which are denominated in the canadian dollar 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  the yen  the british pound  and the canadian dollar 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the yen  the us dollar and the british pound  and the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period 

table of contents a uniform strengthening in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ended december  this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices  which can be also be affected by the change in exchange rates 
other we do not purchase or hold any market risk instruments for trading purposes
