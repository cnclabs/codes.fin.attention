item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business of the company the company manufactures and markets passenger car  light and medium truck  motorsport and motorcycle tires which are sold globally  primarily in the replacement tire market to independent tire dealers  wholesale distributors  regional and national retail tire chains and large retail chains that sell tires as well as other automotive products 
the company faces both general industry and company specific challenges 
these include highly volatile raw material costs  increasing product complexity and pressure from competitors with manufacturing in lower cost regions 
to address these challenges and position the company for future success  the company continues to execute towards strategic imperatives outlined in its strategic plan 
the three strategic imperatives  originally communicated in february  are building a sustainable cost competitive position  driving top line profitable growth and building organizational capabilities and enablers to support strategic goals 
in recent years  the company expanded operations in what are considered lower cost countries 
these initiatives include the cooper kunshan tire manufacturing operation in the prc  the cooper chengshan joint venture in the prc and a joint venture manufacturing operation in mexico 
in early  the company completed an asset acquisition of a manufacturing facility in serbia 
products from these operations provide a lower cost source of tires for existing markets and have been used to expand the company s market share in mexico and the prc 
through a variety of other projects  including the closure of its albany  georgia manufacturing facility  the company also has improved the competitiveness of its manufacturing operations in the united states 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a presents information related to the consolidated results of the operations of the company  a discussion of past results for both of the company s segments  future outlook for the company and information concerning the liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting policies of the company 
the company s future results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements

the company experienced decreases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials in compared with the principal raw materials for the company include natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  chemicals and steel reinforcement components 
approximately percent of the company s raw materials are petroleum based 
substantially all us inventories have been valued using the lifo method of inventory costing which accelerates the impact to cost of goods sold from changes to raw material prices 
the company strives to assure raw material and energy supply and to obtain the most favorable pricing possible 
for natural rubber and natural gas  procurement is managed through a combination of buying forward of production requirements and utilizing the spot market 
for other principal materials  procurement arrangements include supply agreements that may contain formula based pricing based on commodity indices  multi year agreements or spot purchase contracts 
while the company uses these arrangements to satisfy normal manufacturing demands  the pricing volatility in these commodities contributes to the difficulty in managing the costs of raw materials

the company is appealing the decision in that case 
the absence of similar discrete items in was partially offset by continued adjustments to existing reserves based on the company s quarterly comprehensive review of outstanding claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared with million percent of net sales in the decrease was due primarily to reduced incentive compensation and decreases in the accrual for stock based liabilities 
these decreases were partially offset by higher advertising and selling costs to support the effort to grow the company s brands in asia 
these costs reduced as a percentage of net sales as a result of the aforementioned net reduction combined with an increase in net sales in during  the company recorded million in restructuring costs related to the closure of its albany  georgia manufacturing facility and a personnel reduction at its uk location

partially offsetting this gain is the absence of equity investment earnings from coocsa that are now included as a part of the consolidation  rather than in other income as in for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  prior to the deduction of noncontrolling shareholders interests of million

table of contents worldwide tax expense for was favorably impacted by the release of most of the us valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the company began to record a valuation allowance against its us net deferred tax assets during the third quarter of the company has now concluded that  due to the sustained positive operating performance of the us operations  taxable income in carry back periods and the availability of expected future taxable income  it is more likely than not that the benefit of most of the us deferred tax asset will be realized in support of the release of most of the us valuation allowance 
all prior year net operating losses have now been fully utilized 
during the fourth quarter of  the company effectively settled a us tax examination that covered years the settlement resulted in a tax assessment which was offset by previously recorded tax reserves for a net benefit to tax expense of million

the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of its us and us deferred tax asset position at december   as it cannot assure the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the us  the company has offset a portion of its deferred tax asset relating primarily to a capital loss carryforward by a valuation allowance of million 
in addition  the company has recorded valuation allowances of million relating primarily to non us net operating losses for a total valuation allowance of million 
in conjunction with the company s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings  the company will continue to reassess the possibility of releasing all or part of the valuation allowances currently in place when they are deemed to be realizable 
the effects of inflation in areas other than raw materials and utilities did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company in restructuring during  the north american tire operations and the international tire operations segments recorded million and million  respectively  of restructuring expense associated with initiatives announced at various times throughout  and on october   the company announced it would conduct a capacity study of its us manufacturing facilities 
the study was an evolution of the strategic plan as outlined by the company in february all of the company s us manufacturing facilities were included in the review and were analyzed based on a combination of factors  including long term financial benefits  labor relations and productivity 
at the conclusion of the capacity study  on december   the north american tire operations segment announced its plans to close its tire manufacturing facility in albany  georgia 
this closure resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately  people 
certain equipment in the facility was relocated to other manufacturing facilities of the company

demand for tires will vary by region and likely remain sluggish compared to historical growth rates 
two unique items will affect volumes in the us market in the first  and possibly  the second quarter 
as part of the planned cut over to a new erp system in  the company built extra inventory in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of taking down days at its us production facilities during the first quarter 
the company also planned a slow ramp up of production and shipments that will affect its first quarter volume and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  certain us private label customers ended the fourth quarter with an unusually high inventory of tires  including  the company believes  a significant number of chinese tires imported immediately following the expiration of the special us tariff on such tires 
as a result of these inventory levels  the company is seeing reduced orders for private label tires from these customers as they attempt to reduce their inventory 
while these adjustments are expected to affect sales and production volumes during the first quarter and possibly the second quarter  the overall profit impact is expected to be minor due to better mix and other profit improvements 
the company believes it will meet or exceed industry unit volume growth rates following these adjustments 
the company expects raw material prices to remain volatile 
first quarter raw material prices are expected to be nearly flat sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of on a longer term basis we expect raw material prices to increase 
the industry has demonstrated an ability to price to help offset raw material cost volatility  but these price changes typically lag the raw material price changes 
products liability expense is expected to be higher in than this is the result of increases in reserves consistent with the company s long term trend for products liability 
the company will be investing in the business and expects capital expenditures for to total million to million 
while expenditures are higher than depreciation and amortization  the investments are in line with its strategic goals to enhance the capability of global assets and resources 
the company expects its effective tax rate for will most likely be between percent and percent 
the company s record of achievements gives it confidence that it can successfully compete in a volatile economy and industry 
the company s focus in will continue to be guided by its strategic plan which calls for achieving profitable top line growth  improving its global cost structure and improving organizational capabilities 
the company believes it will respond and manage the business accordingly to deliver value to its stakeholders

new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company  see the significant accounting policies accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in its specific circumstances 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 

table of contents products liability the company is a defendant in various products liability claims brought in numerous jurisdictions in which individuals seek damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents allegedly caused by defective tires manufactured by the company 
each of the products liability claims faced by the company generally involve different types of tires  models and lines  different circumstances surrounding the accident such as different applications  vehicles  speeds  road conditions  weather conditions  driver error  tire repair and maintenance practices  service life conditions  as well as different jurisdictions and different injuries 
in addition  in many of the company s products liability lawsuits  the plaintiff alleges that his or her harm was caused by one or more co defendants who acted independently of the company 
accordingly  both the claims asserted and the resolutions of those claims have an enormous amount of variability 
the aggregate amount of damages asserted at any point in time is not determinable since often times when claims are filed  the plaintiffs do not specify the amount of damages 
even when there is an amount alleged  at times the amount is wildly inflated and has no rational basis 
the fact that the company is a defendant in products liability lawsuits is not surprising given the current litigation climate  which is largely confined to the us however  the fact that the company is subject to claims does not indicate that there is a quality issue with the company s tires 
the company sells approximately to million passenger  light truck  suv  radial medium truck and motorcycle tires per year in north america 
the company estimates that approximately million company produced tires made up of thousands of different specifications are still on the road in north america 
while tire disablements do occur  it is the company s and the tire industry s experience that the vast majority of tire failures relate to service related conditions which are entirely out of the company s control such as failure to maintain proper tire pressure  improper maintenance  road hazard and excessive speed 
effective april   the company established a new excess liability insurance program 
the new program covers the company s products liability claims occurring on or after april  and is occurrence based insurance coverage which includes a relatively high per claim retention limit 
the company accrues costs for products liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be estimated 
the company believes the probability of loss can be established and the amount of loss can be estimated only after certain minimum information is available  including verification that company produced products were involved in the incident giving rise to the claim  the condition of the product purported to be involved in the claim  the nature of the incident giving rise to the claim and the extent of the purported injury or damages 
in cases where such information is known  each products liability claim is evaluated based on its specific facts and circumstances 
a judgment is then made to determine the requirement for establishment or revision of an accrual for any potential liability 
the liability often cannot be determined with precision until the claim is resolved 
pursuant to applicable accounting rules  the company accrues the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another 
the company uses a range of settlements because an average settlement cost would not be meaningful since the products liability claims faced by the company are unique and widely variable 
the cases involve different types of tires  models and lines  different circumstances surrounding the accident such as different applications  vehicles  speeds  road conditions  weather conditions  driver error  tire repair and maintenance practices  service life conditions  as well as different jurisdictions and different injuries 
in addition  in many of the company s products liability lawsuits  the plaintiff alleges that his or her harm was caused by one or more co defendants who acted independently of the company 
accordingly  the claims asserted and the resolutions of those claims have an enormous amount of variability 
the costs have ranged from zero dollars to million in one case with no average that is meaningful 
no specific accrual is made for individual unasserted claims or for premature claims  asserted claims where the minimum information needed to evaluate the probability of a liability is not yet known 
however  an accrual for such claims based  in part  on management s expectations for future litigation activity and the settled claims history is maintained 
because of the speculative nature of litigation in the us  the company does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of potential loss for asserted and unasserted claims can be determined 
the company s experience has demonstrated that its estimates have been reasonably accurate and  on average  cases are settled at amounts close to the reserves established 
however  it is possible an individual claim from time to time may result in an aberration from the norm and could have a material impact 
during  the company increased its products liability reserve by million 
the addition of another year of self insured incidents accounted for million of this increase 
the company revised its estimates of future settlements for unasserted and premature claims 
these revisions increased the reserve by million 
finally  changes in the amount of reserves for cases where sufficient information is known to estimate a liability increased by million

table of contents the time frame for the payment of a products liability claim is too variable to be meaningful 
from the time a claim is filed to its ultimate disposition depends on the unique nature of the case  how it is resolved claim dismissed  negotiated settlement  trial verdict and appeals process and is highly dependent on jurisdiction  specific facts  the plaintiff s attorney  the court s docket and other factors 
given that some claims may be resolved in weeks and others may take five years or more  it is impossible to predict with any reasonable reliability the time frame over which the accrued amounts may be paid 
during  the company paid million and during  the company paid million to resolve cases and claims 
the company s products liability reserve balance at december  totaled million current portion of million 
at december   the products liability reserve balance totaled million current portion of million 
the products liability expense reported by the company includes amortization of insurance premium costs  adjustments to settlement reserves and legal costs incurred in defending claims against the company 
products liability costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes the company is required to make certain estimates and judgments to determine income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
the more critical estimates and judgments include assessing uncertain tax positions and measuring unrecognized tax benefits  determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized and whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested 
changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to tax expense in subsequent periods 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
the company applies the rules under accounting standards codification asc in its accounting for uncertainty in income taxes for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not recognition threshold 
pursuant to these rules  the company will initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the tax position  that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
if the tax benefit meets the more likely than not threshold  the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on the company s estimate of the ultimate amount to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority 
the company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with asc and adjusts these liabilities when judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits for permanent and temporary book tax differences for continuing operations  exclusive of interest  totaled approximately million at december  in accordance with company policy  the liability relating to pre years was released or reclassified following the effective settlement of a us federal income tax examination for pre years 
the unrecognized tax benefits at december  relate to and uncertain tax positions 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax asset 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  all available positive and negative evidence is considered  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  the company begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies  and incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  the company considers three years of cumulative operating income loss 
during  the company released the valuation allowance that was previously established related to most of its deferred tax assets in the united states  based upon its assessment of realizability of those assets 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of its us and us deferred tax asset position at december   as it cannot assure the utilization of these assets before they expire 
in the us the company has offset a portion of its deferred tax asset relating primarily to a capital loss carryforward by a valuation allowance of million 
in addition  the company has recorded valuation allowances of million relating primarily to non us net operating losses for a total valuation allowance of million 
in conjunction with the company s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings  the company will continue to reassess the possibility of releasing all or part of the valuation allowances currently in place when they are deemed to be realizable 

table of contents the company generally considers the earnings of certain non us subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
in the event that the company plans to repatriate foreign earnings  the income tax provision would be adjusted in the period it is determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
during  the company plans to remit dividends from two of its non us subsidiaries 
as a result of this decision made in  the company provided incremental us income and foreign withholding tax on these amounts 
in the company s judgment  the remaining portion of the company s foreign earnings is considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
the company has not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately  of these undistributed earnings 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of additional us income taxes that could be payable upon remittance of these earnings since taxes payable would be reduced by foreign tax credits based upon income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution  plus the uncertainty in estimating the impacts of future exchange rates 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and other assets that are intangible 
if an indicator of impairment exists for certain groups of property  plant and equipment or definite lived intangible assets  the company will compare the forecasted undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets to their carrying values 
if the carrying values exceed the undiscounted cash flows  the company then determines the fair values of the assets 
then if the carrying values exceed the fair values of the assets  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
the company assesses the potential impairment of its indefinite lived assets at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the carrying value of these assets is compared to their fair value 
if the carrying values exceed the fair values  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is computed and the impairment charge  if any  is then recorded 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s businesses 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has recorded significant pension liabilities in the us and the us and other postretirement benefit liabilities in the us that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefits payments  expected returns on plan assets and the rates of future compensation increases 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other postretirement benefit liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with its investment advisors and actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the rate used to estimate the value of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities for which they could be settled at the end of the year 
when determining the discount rate  the company discounted the expected pension disbursements over the next fifty years and based upon this analysis  the company used a discount rate of percent to measure its us pension liabilities at december   which is lower than the percent used at december  similarly  the company discounted the expected disbursements of its other postretirement benefit liabilities and based upon this analysis  the company used a discount rate of percent to measure it other postretirement liabilities at december   which is lower than the percent used at december  a similar analysis was completed in the uk and the company decreased the discount rate used to measure its uk pension liabilities to percent at december  from percent at december  the rate of future compensation increases is used to determine the future benefits to be paid for salaried and non bargained employees  since the amount of a participant s pension is partially attributable to the compensation earned during his or her career 
the rate reflects the company s expectations over time for salary and wage inflation and the impacts of promotions and incentive compensation  which is typically tied to profitability 
effective july   the company froze the spectrum salaried employees plan in the us so this assumption is not applicable to valuing the pension liability 
in the uk  the company used percent for the estimated future compensation increase at december  compared to percent at december  the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense  whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense  whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall  whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
the company s investment strategy is to match assets to the cash flows of the pension obligations 
the company s current asset allocation for us plans assets is percent in equity securities and percent in debt securities 
the company s current asset allocation for uk plan assets is percent in equity securities  percent in bonds and percent in property and infrastructure funds 
equity security investments are structured to achieve a balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines 
table of contents the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio and may be adjusted based on a review by the company s investment advisors and actuaries 
industry comparables and other outside guidance is also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
the actual return on us pension plans assets was approximately percent in compared to an asset gain of approximately 
percent in the actual return on uk pension plan assets approximated percent in compared to an asset gain of percent in the company s estimate for the expected long term return on its us plan assets used to derive and pension expense was percent and percent  respectively 
the expected long term return on uk plan assets used to derive the and pension expense was percent and percent  respectively 
the expected long term return on uk plan assets is a blended rate consisting of one rate from january  through april  when the plan was remeasured due to the plan freeze and one rate from april  through december  the company has accumulated net deferred losses resulting from the shortfalls and excesses in actual returns on pension plan assets from expected returns and  in the measurement of pensions and other postretirement liabilities  decreases and increases in the discount rate and the rate of future compensation increases and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience totaling million at december  these amounts are being amortized in accordance with the corridor amortization requirements of us gaap over periods ranging from years to years 
amortization of these net deferred losses was million in and million in the company has implemented household caps on the amounts of retiree medical benefits it will provide to certain retirees 
the caps do not apply to individuals who retired prior to certain specified dates 
costs in excess of these caps will be paid by plan participants 
the company implemented increased cost sharing in in the retiree medical coverage provided to certain eligible current and future retirees 
since then cost sharing has expanded such that nearly all covered retirees pay a charge to be enrolled 
see item a 
risk factors the company s expenditures for pension and postretirement obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
in accordance with us gaap  the company recognizes the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of its pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans and the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs in the consolidated balance sheets 
the unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs components of cumulative other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the company s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates from its financial instruments 
the company actively monitors its exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the impact of these risks 
see the significant accounting policies derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
these analyses measure the potential loss in future earnings  cash flows or fair values of market sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
a decrease in interest rates by ten percent of the actual rates would have adversely affected the fair value of the company s fixed rate  long term debt by approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
an increase in interest rates by ten percent of the actual rates for the company s floating rate long term debt obligations would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows 
to manage the volatility of currency exchange exposures related to future sales and purchases  the company first nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
then  for the residual portion  the company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options with maturities of less than months pursuant to the company s policies and hedging practices 
the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset  in part or in whole  by corresponding changes in the fair value of cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company s unprotected exposures to earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant at december  and the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
the impact from a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s foreign currency denominated obligations and related foreign exchange contracts would not have been material to the company s results of operations and cash flows
