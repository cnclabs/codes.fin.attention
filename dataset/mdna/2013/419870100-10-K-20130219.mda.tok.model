item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hei and heco in the case of heco  only the information related to heco and its subsidiaries the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hawaiian electric industries  inc s hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and  in the case of heco  in conjunction with heco s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which are incorporated by reference to pages to of heco exhibit the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions of the electric utilities and the bank that follow 
hei consolidated executive overview and strategy 
hei is a holding company that operates subsidiaries collectively  the company  principally in hawaii s electric utility and banking sectors 
hei s strategy is to build fundamental earnings and profitability of its electric utilities and bank in a controlled risk manner to support its current dividend and improve operating and capital efficiency in order to build shareholder value 
hei  through its electric utility subsidiaries hawaiian electric company  inc heco and its subsidiaries  hawaii electric light company  inc helco and maui electric company  limited meco  provides the only electric public utility service to approximately of hawaii s population 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  american savings bank  fsb asb  one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on total assets 
together  hei s unique combination of electric utilities and a bank continues to provide the company with a strong balance sheet and the financial resources to invest in the strategic growth of its subsidiaries while providing an attractive dividend for investors 
in  net income for hei common stock was million  up slightly from million in due to lower losses for the other segment  partly offset by slightly lower earnings for the electric utility and bank segments 
basic earnings per share were per share in  down from per share in due to the effects of the higher weighted average number of shares outstanding 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s energy needs by modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy generation and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
electric utility net income for common stock in of million decreased from the prior year due primarily to a writedown of million net of taxes of project costs in lieu of conducting regulatory audits  partly offset by higher rate increases 
key to results for will be the impacts of actions taken under the hawaii clean energy initiative hcei and energy agreement  including the steps taken toward the integration of new generation from a variety of renewable energy sources into the utility systems  and managing o m expenses to the levels included in rates 
asb continues to develop and introduce new products and services in order to meet the needs of both consumer and commercial customers 
additionally  asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt to a constantly changing banking industry and remain competitive 
asb s earnings in of million decreased million compared to prior year net income due primarily to lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses  partly offset by higher noninterest income and a lower provision for loan losses 
asb s future financial results will continue to be impacted by the interest rate environment and the quality of asb s loan portfolio 
hei s other segment had a net loss in of million  compared to the net loss of million in shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since the indicated dividend yield as of december  was 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for common stock for  and were  and  respectively 
the hei board of directors considers many factors in determining the dividend quarterly  including but not limited to the company s results of operations  the long term prospects for the company  and current and expected future economic conditions 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
economic conditions 
note the statistical data in this section is from public third party sources eg  department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt  university of hawaii economic research organization uhero  us bureau of labor statistics  blue chip economic indicators  us energy information administration  hawaii tourism authority  honolulu board of realtors  bureau of economic analysis and national and local newspapers 
hawaii s tourism industry  a significant driver of hawaii s economy  set new records in state visitor arrivals grew by in over total state visitor arrivals reached a new record in state visitor expenditures also continued to grow  increasing by in over  achieving another record for the state 
hotel occupancies and room rates also continued to rise 
the outlook for the visitor industry remains positive with the hawaii tourism authority expecting a increase in airline seat capacity for the first quarter of over hawaii s unemployment rate was in december  lower than the state s rate in december and the december national unemployment rate of 
hawaii s unemployment rate has slowly improved after reaching a high of in hawaii real estate activity improved in as indicated by the home resale market 
the median sales price for single family residential homes on oahu increased by and home sales increased over the median sales price for oahu condominiums rose above and closed sales increased 
hawaii s petroleum product prices reflect supply and demand in the asia pacific region and the price of crude oil in international markets 
the dramatic reduction in japan s nuclear production following the tragic earthquake and tsunami in march has increased regional demand for energy supplies  including petroleum  and the prices of the utilities fuels have accordingly remained at the elevated level throughout based on the current moderate economic outlook  the federal open market committee fomc maintained their efforts to stimulate the us economy in a meeting on december  the fomc held the federal funds rate target at to and expects to maintain the record low rates at least as long as the unemployment rate is above and inflation remains under control 
the fomc will continue to purchase additional agency mortgage backed securities out of concern that economic growth may not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions 
in an effort to assist broader accommodative financial conditions  the fomc announced it will initially purchase billion per month of longer term treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the fomc stated it will closely monitor economic information in the coming months and may take additional steps to improve the labor market in a context of price stability 
overall  hawaii s economy is expected to see only modest growth in and with local economic growth supported by moderate improvement in the us economy and impeded by continued uncertainty in global economies 
based on updated economic projections and expectations of renewable self generation and energy efficiency additions  the electric utilities kilowatthour sales are expected to decline slightly from levels and then remain relatively flat until recent tax developments 
the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of contained major tax provisions that impacted the company through  including the and bonus depreciation provisions for qualified property that resulted in an estimated net increase in federal tax depreciation of million for  primarily attributable to the utilities 
in january  the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law and provided a one year extension of bonus depreciation  which is estimated to increase the company s federal tax depreciation for by million  primarily attributable to the utilities 
in december  the internal revenue service irs issued regulations that provide a framework for determining whether expenditures are deductible as repairs  effective january  but in december  the irs delayed the effective date of these regulations until january  the company will review these regulations and will analyze any subsequently issued transitional rules and guidance for their impacts and for the opportunities they present for and future years 
health care reform 
on june   the us supreme court upheld the patient protection and affordable care act  the health care reform law 
currently  hawaii s prepaid health care act generally provides greater benefits to employees and dependents because of cost sharing limitations 
the company will continue to comply with its obligations under these laws and to monitor the interaction of the state and federal laws

see executive overview and strategy above and the other segment  electric utility and bank sections below for discussions of results of operations 
retirement benefits 
the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans  plus earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets  and changes made to the provisions of the plans 
during  for example  the qualified retirement plan for employees of hei and heco was changed for employees hired on or after may  those employees will receive lower benefit accruals  different early retirement reduction factors and no automatic cost of living increases 
the change is expected to decrease ongoing costs through a reduction in service cost 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the company s accounting for retirement benefits under the plans in which the employees of heco and its subsidiaries participate is also adjusted to account for the impact of decisions by the public utilities commission of the state of hawaii puc 
changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
for  the company s retirement benefit plans assets generated a gain of  net of investment management fees  resulting in net earnings and unrealized gains of million  compared to net losses and unrealized losses of million for and net earnings and unrealized gains of million for the market value of the retirement benefit plans assets for december  and were billion and million  respectively 
the company intends to make contributions to the qualified pension plan for hei and heco equal to the calculated net periodic pension cost for the year 
however  if the minimum required contribution determined under the employee retirement income security act of erisa  as amended by the pension protection act of  for the year is greater than the net periodic pension cost  then the company will contribute the minimum required contribution and the utilities difference between the minimum required contribution and the net periodic pension cost will increase their regulatory asset 
in the next rate case  the regulatory asset will be amortized over five years and used to reduce the cash funding requirement based on net periodic pension cost 
the regulatory asset may not be applied against the erisa minimum required contribution 
the net periodic pension cost is expected to be higher than the erisa minimum required contribution for therefore  to satisfy the requirements of the electric utilities pension tracking mechanism  net periodic pension cost will be the basis of the cash funding for based on plan assets as of december  and various assumptions in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company estimates the net periodic pension cost contribution to be million million for hei and million for the utilities 
based on various assumptions in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and assuming no further changes in retirement benefit plan provisions  information regarding consolidated hei s  consolidated heco s and asb s retirement benefits was  or is estimated to be  as follows  and constitutes forward looking statements aoci balance  net of tax benefits  related to retirement benefits liability retirement benefits expense  net of tax benefits retirement benefits paid and plan expenses december years ended december years ended december in millions estimated consolidated hei consolidated heco asb based on various assumptions in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  sensitivities of the projected benefit obligation pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of december   associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions  were as follows and constitute forward looking statements 
actuarial assumption change in assumption in basis points impact on pbo or apbo dollars in millions pension benefits discount rate other benefits discount rate health care cost trend rate the impact on net income for common stock for changes in actuarial assumptions should be immaterial based on the adoption by the electric utilities of pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb tracking mechanisms approved by the puc

other segment

the other business segment includes results of the stand alone corporate operations of hei and american savings holdings  inc ashi  both holding companies  hei properties  inc heipi  a company holding passive  venture capital investments venture capital investments valued at million as of december   the old oahu tug service  inc toots  a maritime freight transportation company that ceased operations in  and pacific energy conservation services  inc pecs  a contract services company which provided windfarm operational and maintenance services to an affiliated electric utility until the windfarm was dismantled in the fourth quarter of and dissolved in the second quarter of  as well as eliminations of intercompany transactions 
hei corporate level operating  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in in  hei had higher executive compensation and employee benefits expenses  including retirement benefits 
in  expense increased primarily due to the accrual of million of contributions to be made to the hei charitable foundation in the other segment s interest expenses were million in  million in and million in in  hei had lower average borrowings and interest rates 
in and  financing costs were higher due in part to the recognition of the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of forward starting swaps 
also in  there was a higher level of borrowings 
the other segment s income tax benefits were million in  million in and million in the increase in income tax benefits in was primarily due to higher operating losses  higher interest expense and a favorable settlement in in an irs appeal related to the character ordinary versus capital of a foreign loss  and the write off in of a deferred tax asset due to the expiration of a capital loss carryforward period 
effects of inflation 
us inflation  as measured by the us consumer price index cpi  averaged in  in and in hawaii inflation  as measured by the honolulu cpi  was in  in and in the department of business  economic development and tourism estimates average honolulu cpi to have been in and forecasts it to be for inflation continues to have an impact on hei s operations 
inflation increases operating costs and the replacement cost of assets 
subsidiaries with significant physical assets  such as the electric utilities  replace assets at much higher costs and must request and obtain rate increases to maintain adequate earnings 
in the past  the puc has granted rate increases in part to cover increases in construction costs and operating expenses due to inflation

liquidity and capital resources 
selected contractual obligations and commitments 
information about payments under the specified contractual obligations and commercial commitments of hei and its subsidiaries was as follows december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations deposit liabilities other bank borrowings long term debt interest on certificates of deposit  other bank borrowings and long term debt operating leases  service bureau contract and maintenance agreements open purchase order obligations fuel oil purchase obligations estimate based on december  fuel oil prices power purchase obligations minimum fixed capacity charges liabilities for uncertain tax positions total estimated deposits that have no maturity are included in the less than year column  however  they may have a duration longer than one year 
includes contractual obligations and commitments for capital expenditures and expense amounts 
december  total in millions other commercial commitments to asb customers loan commitments primarily expiring in loans in process unused lines and letters of credit total the tables above do not include other categories of obligations and commitments  such as deferred taxes  trade payables  amounts that will become payable in future periods under collective bargaining and other employment agreements and employee benefit plans  obligations that may arise under indemnities provided to purchasers of discontinued operations and potential refunds of amounts collected under interim decision and orders d os of the puc 
as of december   the fair value of the assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of the company s retirement benefit plans did not exceed the retirement benefit plans benefit obligation 
minimum funding requirements for retirement benefit plans have not been included in the tables above  however  see retirement benefits above for estimated minimum required contributions for see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fuel and power purchase commitments 
the company believes that its ability to generate cash  both internally from electric utility and banking operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and bank borrowings  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its contractual obligations and commercial commitments  its forecasted capital expenditures and investments  its expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company s total assets were billion as of december  and billion as of december  the consolidated capital structure of hei excluding deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings other than bank long term debt  net other than bank preferred stock of subsidiaries common stock equity hei s short term borrowings and hei s line of credit facility were as follows year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings commercial paper line of credit draws undrawn capacity under hei s line of credit facility expiring december  this table does not include heco s separate commercial paper issuances and line of credit facilities and draws  which are disclosed below under electric utility financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at february   hei s outstanding commercial paper balance was million and its line of credit facility was undrawn 
the maximum amount of hei s short term borrowings in was million 
hei utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance commercial paper  to retire long term debt  to pay dividends and for other temporary requirements 
hei also periodically makes short term loans to heco to meet heco s cash requirements  including the funding of loans by heco to helco and meco  but no such short term loans to heco were outstanding as of december  hei periodically utilizes long term debt  historically consisting of medium term notes and other unsecured indebtedness  to fund investments in and loans to its subsidiaries to support their capital improvement or other requirements  to repay long term and short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
in november  hei filed an omnibus registration statement to register an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities 
under securities and exchange commission sec regulations  this registration statement expires on november  on march   hei issued million of senior notes via a private placement million of notes due march  and million of notes due march  
hei used part of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to pay down commercial paper originally issued to refinance million of medium term notes that matured on march  and ultimately used the remaining proceeds to refinance part of the million of medium term notes that matured on august  hei has a line of credit facility of million 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement  amended in december  contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of hei s issuer rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
in addition to their impact on pricing under hei s credit agreement  the rating of hei s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of hei to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of hei securities 
on august   moody s maintained hei s long term and short term commercial paper ratings and stable outlook  indicating that the long term rating reflects the relatively stable earnings and cash flow historically provided by its vertically integrated utility businesses and banking operation  improving financial performance  particularly at the utility which has helped to lower the dividend payout ratio 
the stable rating outlook factors in moody s belief that the decoupling mechanism will reduce regulatory lag and better match cost recovery of expenses and capital investment such that heco s consolidated roe will approach authorized returns over time and the expectation that profitability initiatives at asb will produce fairly predictable earnings enabling asb to provide regular dividends to hei without jeopardizing the bank s strong capital position 
moody s indicated the rating could be downgraded if the puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism  or if hei s cash flow to debt declined to below last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times times last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s on a sustainable basis 
on november   s p maintained hei s long term and corporate credit rating of bbb  short term commercial paper rating of a  stable outlook  strong business risk profile and aggressive financial risk profile 
the stable outlook reflects s p s view that the consolidated credit profile will remain consistent with the hei bbb ratings and incorporates the benefits of decoupling  expectations of supportive rate case outcomes and a balanced funding approach that supports the current capital structure 
s p indicated the corporate credit rating would be lowered if hei s financial performance weakens so that funds from operations ffo to total debt is less than and debt to capital approaches on a consistent basis 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of hei securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p senior unsecured debt bbb baa the above ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency  from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
management believes that  if hei s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets for commercial paper with hei s ratings or in general were to tighten  it could be more difficult and or expensive for hei to sell commercial paper or hei might not be able to sell commercial paper in the future 
such limitations could cause hei to draw on its syndicated credit facility instead  and the costs of such borrowings could increase under the terms of the credit agreement as a result of any such ratings downgrades 
similarly  if hei s long term debt ratings were to be downgraded  it could be more difficult and or expensive for hei to issue long term debt 
such limitations and or increased costs could materially adversely affect the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity of hei and its subsidiaries 
issuances of common stock through the hawaiian electric industries  inc dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan drip  hawaiian electric industries retirement savings plan heirsp and the asb k plan provided new capital of million approximately million shares in  million approximately million shares in and million approximately million shares in from august  to january   hei satisfied the share purchase requirements of the drip  heirsp and asb k plan through open market purchases of its common stock rather than new issuances 
operating activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in investing activities used net cash of million in  million in and million in in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities  heco s consolidated capital expenditures net of contributions in aid of construction and a net increase in loans held for investment  partly offset by the repayments of  and the proceeds from sales of  investment and mortgage related securities 
financing activities provided used net cash of million in  million in and million in in  net cash provided by financing activities included net increases in deposits  long term debt and short term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under hei plans  offset by the net decrease in retail repurchase agreements and the payment of common and preferred stock dividends 
other than capital contributions from their parent company  intercompany services and related intercompany payables and receivables  heco s periodic short term borrowings from hei and related interest and the payment of dividends to hei  the electric utility and bank segments are largely autonomous in their operating  investing and financing activities 
see the electric utility and bank segments discussions of their cash flows in their respective financial condition liquidity and capital resources sections below 
during  heco and asb via ashi paid cash dividends to hei of million and million  respectively 
a portion of the net assets of heco and asb is not available for transfer to hei in the form of dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval 
one of the conditions to the puc s approval of the merger and corporate restructuring of heco and hei requires that heco maintain a consolidated common equity to total capitalization ratio of not less than actual ratio of at december   and restricts heco from making distributions to hei to the extent it would result in that ratio being less than 
in the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or asb  such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of hei  its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
forecasted hei consolidated net cash used in investing activities excluding investing cash flows from asb for through consists primarily of the net capital expenditures of heco and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the funds required for the electric utilities construction programs see electric utility liquidity and capital resources  approximately million will be required during through to repay maturing hei medium term notes  which are expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper  bank borrowings  other medium or long term debt  common stock and or dividends from subsidiaries 
medium term notes of million maturing in march are expected to be replaced with new debt 
in addition  heco special purpose revenue bonds sprbs totaling million will be maturing during through and are expected to be repaid with proceeds from issuances of long term debt 
additional debt and or equity financing may be utilized to invest in the utilities and bank  pay down commercial paper or other short term borrowings or may be required to fund unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects of the utilities  unanticipated utility capital expenditures that may be required by the hcei or new environmental laws and regulations  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements and higher tax payments that would result if certain tax positions taken by the company do not prevail or if taxes are increased by federal or state legislation 
in addition  existing debt may be refinanced prior to maturity potentially at more favorable rates with additional debt or equity financing or both 
as further explained in retirement benefits above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and opeb plans 
the company s contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in million by the utilities  million by hei and million by asb  million in million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb and million in million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb and are expected to total million in million by the utilities  million by hei and nil by asb 
these contributions satisfied the minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa  including changes promulgated by the pension protection act of  and the requirements of the electric utilities pension and opeb tracking mechanisms 
in addition  the company paid directly million of benefits in  million in and million in and expects to pay million of benefits in depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the company believes it will have adequate cash flow or access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
although the company has off balance sheet arrangements  management has determined that it has no off balance sheet arrangements that either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors  including the following types of off balance sheet arrangements obligations under guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  obligations under derivative instruments  and obligations under a material variable interest held by the company in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s results of operations and financial condition can be affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond its control and could cause future results of operations to differ materially from historical results 
the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
also see forward looking statements and risk factors above and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition in each of the electric utility and bank segment discussions below 
economic conditions  us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
because the core businesses of hei s subsidiaries are providing local electric public utility services and banking services in hawaii  the company s operating results are significantly influenced by hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism  by the impact of interest rates  particularly on the construction and real estate industries  and by the impact of world conditions on federal government spending in hawaii 
the two largest components of hawaii s economy are tourism and the federal government including the military 
declines in the hawaii  us and asian economies in recent years led to declines in kwh sales  delinquencies in asb s loan portfolio and other adverse effects on hei s businesses 
if s p or moody s were to downgrade hei s or heco s debt ratings  or if future events were to adversely affect the availability of capital to the company  hei s and heco s ability to borrow and raise capital could be constrained and their future borrowing costs would likely increase 
changes in the us capital markets can also have significant effects on the company 
for example  pension funding requirements are affected by the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust  and by the discount rate used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and value obligations 
the electric utilities pension tracking mechanisms help moderate pension expense  however  a decline in the value of the company s defined benefit pension plan assets may increase the unfunded status of the company s pension plans and result in increases in future funding requirements 
because the earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
changes in interest rates and credit spreads also affect the fair value of asb s investment and mortgage related securities 
hei and its electric utility subsidiaries are also exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to their periodic borrowing requirements  the discount rate used to determine pension funding requirements and the possible effect of interest rates on the electric utilities rates of return and overall economic activity 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including general economic conditions and the policies of government and regulatory authorities 
hei cannot predict future changes in interest rates  nor be certain that interest rate risk management strategies it or its subsidiaries have implemented will be successful in managing interest rate risk 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
heco  helco and meco s transmission and distribution systems excluding substation buildings and contents have a replacement value roughly estimated at billion and are uninsured 
similarly  heco  helco and meco have no business interruption insurance 
if a hurricane or other uninsured catastrophic natural disaster were to occur  and if the puc were not to allow the utilities to recover from ratepayers restoration costs and revenues lost from business interruption  their results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely impacted 
certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to an insurance deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur uninsured losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  may require that certain environmental permits be obtained and maintained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities 
obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment and mortgage related securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  and allowance for loan losses 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies discussed below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s results of operations and financial condition  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the policies affecting both of the company s two principal segments are discussed below and the policies affecting just one segment are discussed in the respective segment s section of material estimates and critical accounting policies 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee and  as applicable  the heco audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and for additional discussion of material estimates and critical accounting policies  see the electric utility and bank segment discussions below under the same heading 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations 
for a discussion of material estimates related to pension and other postretirement benefits collectively  retirement benefits  including costs  major assumptions  plan assets  other factors affecting costs  accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci charges and sensitivity analyses  see retirement benefits in consolidated results of operations above and notes and of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings including puc proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  including costs of investigation 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered through future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from its tax advisors 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
following are discussions of the electric utility and bank segments 
additional segment information is shown in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion concerning hawaiian electric company  inc should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
electric utility executive overview and strategy 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy generation including the use of biofuels and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
heco has completed construction of a new generating unit that uses biodiesel fuel and has completed both phases of the east oahu transmission project eotp a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of oahu to load centers on the east side 
heco and its subsidiaries have been taking actions intended to protect hawaii s island ecology and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions  while continuing to provide reliable power to customers 
a three pronged strategy supports attainment of the requirements and goals of the state of hawaii renewable portfolio standards rps  the hawaii global warming solutions act of and the hcei by the greening of existing assets  the expansion of renewable energy generation and embracing energy efficiency and load management programs 
utility strategic progress 
in  the utilities continued to make significant progress in implementing their clean energy strategies and the puc issued several important regulatory decisions  all of which are key steps to support hawaii s efforts to reduce its dependence on oil 
included in the puc decisions were a number of interim and final rate case decisions see table in most recent rate proceedings below 
additional puc decisions are needed that will allow the utilities to recover their increasing expenditures for clean energy and reliability on a more timely basis 
regulatory 
with puc approval  decoupling was implemented by heco on march   by helco on april  and by meco on may  decoupling is a regulatory model that is intended to facilitate meeting the state of hawaii s goals to transition to a clean energy economy and achieve an aggressive renewable portfolio standard 
the decoupling model implemented in hawaii delinks revenues from sales and includes annual revenue adjustments for certain o m expenses and rate base changes 
the decoupling mechanism has three components a sales decoupling component via a revenue balancing account rba  a revenue escalation component via a revenue adjustment mechanism ram and an earnings sharing mechanism  which would provide for a reduction of revenues between rate cases in the event the utility exceeds the roace allowed in its most recent rate case 
decoupling provides for more timely cost recovery and earning on investments 
the implementation of decoupling has resulted in an improvement in the utilities under earning situation that has existed over the last several years 
prior to and during the transition to decoupling  however  the utilities returns have been well below puc allowed returns 
under decoupling  the most significant drivers for improving earnings are completing major capital projects within puc approved amounts and on schedule  managing o m expenses relative to authorized o m adjustments  and regulatory outcomes that cover o m requirements and rate base items not included in the rams 
in january  the utilities and consumer advocate signed a settlement agreement  subject to puc approval  to write off million of cis project costs  in lieu of conducting regulatory audits of two major projects 
see subsequent event in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
future earnings growth is also dependent on rate base growth 
the utilities five year forecast reflects net capital expenditures of billion and a compounded annual rate base growth rate in the range of to 
many of the major initiatives within this forecast are expected to be completed beyond the year period 
major initiatives which comprise approximately of the year plan include projects relating to environmental compliance  fuel infrastructure investments  new generation  and infrastructure investments to integrate more energy from renewables into the system 
estimates for these initiatives could change over time  based on external factors such as the timing and scope of environmental regulations  unforeseen delays in permitting and the outcome of competitive bidding for new generation 
actual and puc allowed returns were as follows return on rate base rorb roace year ended december  heco helco meco heco helco meco utility returns puc allowed returns difference based on recorded operating income and average rate base  both adjusted for items not included in determining electric rates 
recorded net income divided by average common equity for the approval of decoupling by the puc will help the utilities to gradually improve their roaces beyond  which will facilitate the utilities ability to effectively raise capital for needed infrastructure investments 
however  the utilities continue to expect an ongoing gap between their puc allowed roaces and the roaces they actually achieve 
the timing of general rate case decisions  the effective date of the rams and the puc s consistent exclusion of certain expenses from rates are estimated to have a consolidated roace impact of to basis points per year 
in addition  there are other items that are not covered by the annual rams that could also have an ongoing impact on the roaces actually achieved by the utilities 
for example  investments in software projects  o m in excess of indexed escalations and changes in fuel inventory must be addressed in a general rate case 
while the specific magnitude of the impact can fluctuate depending on the size of the projects and exogenous factors  the utilities anticipate that these items could incrementally impact consolidated roace by to basis points in each of the next two years 
as part of decoupling  heco also tracks its rate making roace as calculated under the earnings sharing mechanism and which includes only items considered in establishing rates 
earnings over and above the roace allowed by the puc are shared between heco and its ratepayers on a tiered basis 
for  heco s rate making roace was  which was above the puc allowed roace and triggered its earnings sharing mechanism 
as a result  heco will credit its customers million for their portion of the earnings sharing 
heco s rate making roace of included various adjustments to heco s actual roace of such as the exclusion of the partial writedown of cis project costs to reflect the settlement agreement  subject to puc approval  and of other expenses not considered in establishing electric rates eg  executive bonuses and advertising 
helco s rate making roace was and meco s rate making roace was  which did not trigger the earnings sharing mechanism 
decoupling implementation 
effective march   as part of the decoupling implementation  heco established the rba and started recording the difference between target revenues from its heco rate case and actual revenues 
under the decoupling tariff order heco will accrue and collect ths of the annual ram adjusted revenues in one year and the remaining ths in the following year 
heco s annual decoupling filing for the tariff that is effective june  through may  reflects a ram adjustment of million million for o m costs and million for invested capital 
the filing also includes the collection of the accrued rba balance as of december  and associated revenue taxes of million 
under the january settlement agreement with the consumer advocate  subject to puc approval  the parties agreed that  starting in  heco will be allowed to record ram revenues starting january of each year through see subsequent event in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
helco and meco began tracking their target revenues and actual recorded revenues via rbas on april  and may   respectively  when their test year final rates went into effect 
helco s tariff for its annual ram for reflects a revenue adjustment that results in a reduction in annual revenues of million  effective through may  meco filed its ram calculated to be million for informational purposes only since the pending interim d o for its test year rate case was anticipated to be issued shortly

most recent rate proceedings 
unless otherwise agreed or ordered  each electric utility may initiate a puc proceeding every third year on a staggered basis to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
the puc may grant an interim increase within to months following the filing of an application  but there is no guarantee of such an interim increase and interim amounts collected are refundable  with interest  to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the puc s final d o 
the timing and amount of any final increase is determined at the discretion of the puc 
the adoption of revenue  expense  rate base and cost of capital amounts including the roace and rorb for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the puc to accept any such amounts in its final d o 
the following table summarizes certain details of each utility s most recent rate cases  including the details of the increases requested  whether the utility and the consumer advocate reached a settlement that they proposed to the puc  the details of any granted interim and final puc d o increases  and whether an interim or final puc d o remains pending

all other line items reflect the effective dates of the revised schedules and tariffs as a result of puc approved increases 
in april  heco reduced this rate increase request by million because a new customer information system would not be placed in service as originally planned see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the final increase was million less in annual revenues  heco refunded million to customers including interest in february heco filed a request with the puc for a general rate increase of million  based on a test year and without the then estimated impacts of the implementation of decoupling as proposed in the puc s separate decoupling proceeding and depreciation rates and methodology as proposed by heco in a separate depreciation proceeding 
including the estimated effects of the implementation of decoupling at the time  the effective revenue request was million  or 
heco s request was primarily to pay for major capital projects and higher o m costs to maintain and improve service reliability and to recover the costs for several proposed programs to help reduce hawaii s dependence on imported oil  and to further increase reliability and fuel security 
the million  million  and million interim increases  and the million final increase  include the million in annual revenues that were being recovered through the decoupling ram prior to the first interim increase 
helco s request was primarily to cover investments for system upgrade projects  two major transmission line upgrades and increasing o m expenses 
on february   the puc issued a final d o  which reflected the approval of decoupling and cost recovery mechanisms  and on february   helco filed its revised tariffs to reflect the increase in rates 
on april   the puc issued an order approving the revised tariffs  which became effective april  helco implemented the decoupling mechanism and began tracking the target revenues and actual recorded revenues via a revenue balancing account 
helco also reset the heat rates and implemented heat rate deadbands and the ppac  which provides a surcharge mechanism that more closely aligns cost recovery with costs incurred 
the revised tariffs reflect a lower increase in annual revenue requirement compared to the interim increase due to factors that became effective concurrently with the revised tariffs lower depreciation rates and lower roace and therefore  no refund to customers was required 
helco s request is required to pay for o m expenses and additional investments in plant and equipment required to maintain and improve system reliability and to cover the increased costs to support the integration of more renewable energy generation 
also see subsequent event in note of hei s consolidated financial statements 
meco s interim increase  effective august   was based on a stipulated agreement reached with the consumer advocate and temporary approval of new depreciation rates and methodology in a separate depreciation proceeding 
the adjustment to this increase  effective january   reflects the final rates from meco s test year rate case 
on february   the puc issued an order instructing meco and the consumer advocate to submit a revised stipulated agreement to incorporate the applicable rulings and decisions in d os issued in related proceedings since the first stipulation was filed 
on march   meco and the consumer advocate filed an updated agreement on all material issues in meco s test year rate case proceeding 
on may   the puc issued a final d o  which approved the updated agreement  and on may   the tariffs implementing the d o became effective 
meco implemented the decoupling mechanism and began tracking the target revenues and actual recorded revenues via a revenue balancing account 
meco also reset the heat rates and implemented heat rate deadbands and the ppac  which provides a surcharge mechanism that more closely aligns cost recovery with costs incurred 
the revised tariffs reflect a lower increase in annual revenue requirement than the interim increase due to factors that became effective concurrently with the revised tariffs lower depreciation rates and lower roace and therefore  no refund was required 
meco s request is required to pay for o m expenses and additional investments in plant and equipment required to maintain and improve system reliability and to cover the increased costs to support the integration of more renewable energy generation 
see the discussion below on interim decision and subsequent proposed adjustments to the interim increase 
heco test year rate case 
on july   the puc issued an interim d o in heco s test year rate case  which became effective july   granting a total annual interim increase of million  or  or an increase of million in annual revenues  or  net of the million of revenues currently being recovered through the decoupling revenue adjustment mechanism ram 
the interim increase is based on  and is substantially the same as  the increase proposed in the settlement agreement executed and filed on july  by heco  the consumer advocate and the department of defense the parties in the proceeding 
the interim increase reflected the new depreciation rates and methods approved by the puc in a separate proceeding  which resulted in a million decrease in depreciation expense effective with interim rates to the end of the puc did not approve the portion of the settlement agreement with the consumer advocate allowing deferral of certain costs and heco filed a motion for clarification and or partial reconsideration of the interim d o s findings and conclusions on the deferral of costs 
on february   the puc issued an order which approved the deferral of interisland wind project support costs of up to million  denied heco s request to defer certain consultant expenses associated with the enterprise resource planning enterprise asset management erp eam system costs  but allowed heco to include  in its test year expenses for such costs  and granted heco s request to defer customer information system cis project operation and maintenance o m expenses limited to  per year in and under the settlement agreement that are to be subject to a regulatory audit of project costs  and allowed heco to accrue afudc on these deferred costs until the completion of the regulatory audit 
as a result of the order  heco reflected in the first quarter of the deferral of million million for the interisland wind project support costs and million for cis project o m expenses incurred from july  through december  that were previously expensed and deferred any costs incurred up to the limitations stated in the order 
for a discussion of a january settlement agreement resulting in the write off of million of cis project costs  see subsequent event in note of hei s consolidated financial statements 
on february   the parties reached a settlement agreement on the eotp phase project costs  agreeing that  in lieu of a regulatory audit  heco would write off million of gross plant in service eotp phase costs and associated adjustments and carrying charges 
the settlement agreement resulted in an after tax charge to net income in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
the parties also agreed to stipulate to an additional annual interim increase of million to be effective march   based on additional revenue requirements reflecting all remaining eotp costs not previously included in rates and offset by other minor adjustments to the interim increase that became effective on july  on march   the puc approved the settlement agreement  and ordered that the regulatory audit for eotp phase need not be conducted 
a revised tariff to reflect an increase in the interim increase became effective april  on may   the puc approved heco s requested adjustment of  ie   grossed up for revenue taxes to its interim increase to include the erp eam system evaluation costs in its test year expenses 
revised rates became effective may  on june   the puc issued a final d o in heco s test year proceeding  which finalized approval of the previous interim increases already in effect 
it also approved a second stipulated settlement agreement entered into on june  by heco  the consumer advocate and the department of defense parties in the proceeding to reflect an additional reduction in the test year rate increase of  to remove parent company non incentive executive compensation and administrative costs 
on september   the final revised tariffs reflecting the final d o became effective 
since the final rate increase as a result of the second stipulated supplement to the settlement agreement was lower than the interim increase then currently in effect  heco refunded to customers  effective september  through september   approximately million which included accrued interest since july  
meco test year rate case 
on may   the puc issued an interim d o in meco s test year rate case  which became effective june  the d o authorized meco to reset its target heat rates by fuel type to test year levels for the purpose of calculating the energy cost adjustment clause ecac adjustment factor  which will help to ensure meco s continuing recovery of its fuel costs 
the interim increase is based on meco s updated stipulated agreement with the consumer advocate filed on may  on july   meco and the consumer advocate filed a stipulated supplement to the stipulated agreement to reduce the test year revenue requirement by million in administrative and general expenses and requested that the final d o for this rate case incorporate the adjustment into the final test year revenue requirement 
clean energy strategy 
the utilities policy is to support efforts to increase renewable energy in hawaii 
the utilities believe their actions will help stabilize customer bills over time as they become less dependent on costly and price volatile fossil fuel 
the utilities clean energy strategy will also allow them to meet hawaii s rps law  which requires electric utilities to meet an rps of   and by december    and  respectively 
heco met the rps for with a consolidated rps of  including savings from energy efficiency programs and solar water heating or without dsm energy savings 
energy savings resulting from dsm energy efficiency programs and solar water heating will not count toward the rps after through september  heco achieved an rps without dsm energy savings of  primarily through a comprehensive portfolio of renewable energy power purchase agreements  net energy metering programs and biofuels 
the utilities believe they are on track to meet the rps 
recent developments in the utilities clean energy strategy include the following also see the projects discussed under renewable energy projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements in february  the puc opened dockets related to meco s and heco s plans to proceed with competitive bidding processes to acquire up to approximately mw and mw  respectively  of new  renewable firm dispatchable capacity generation resources  with the initial increments expected to come on line in and  respectively 
due to a subsequent lowering of meco s forecasted peaks  the projected capacity need date on the island of maui has been deferred to and the capacity requirement has been reduced to mw 
due to a subsequent lowering of heco s forecasted sales and peaks  the projected capacity need and the timing will be dependent on the possible retirement of generating units 
meco and heco plan to file draft requests for proposals rfps for future capacity with the puc in in august  heco signed a year contract  subject to puc approval  with hawaii bioenergy to supply million gallons per year of biocrude at kahe power plant with initial consumption to begin as early as in  heco also signed other contracts  subject to puc approval  for lesser amounts of biocrude and for biodiesel for testing or operations 
in september  the puc denied the utilities requested approval of helco s contract with akp citing the higher cost of the biofuel over the cost of petroleum diesel 
in august  helco signed a new year contract with aina koa pono ka u llc akp  subject to puc approval  to supply million gallons of biodiesel per year with initial consumption to begin within five years of puc approval 
in may  the puc approved a year biodiesel supply contract with renewable energy group through july for continued biodiesel supply to ct of million to million gallons per year 
in may  heco signed a contract  which was approved by the puc  with the city and county of honolulu to purchase an additional mw of capacity and energy from an expanded waste to energy hpower facility 
in may  helco signed a power purchase agreement  subject to puc approval  with hu honua bioenergy for mw of renewable  dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass from a facility on the island of hawaii 
in august  the battery facility at a mw kahuku wind farm experienced a fire and heco has not purchased wind energy from the wind farm since then 
in august  the puc approved a waiver from the competitive bidding process to allow heco to negotiate with the us department of the army for construction of a mw utility owned and operated firm  renewable and dispatchable generation facility at schofield barracks on the island of oahu 
in september  heco began purchasing test wind energy from the mw kawailoa wind  llc facility 
the wind farm was placed into full commercial operation in november in december  the puc approved a year biodiesel supply contract with pacific biodiesel to supply  to million gallons of biodiesel at the honolulu international airport emergency power facility beginning in in december  the mw auwahi wind energy llc facility was placed into commercial operation  selling power to meco under a year contract 
in december  the mw kalaeloa solar two  llc pv facility was placed into commercial operation  selling power to heco under a year contract 
heco  helco and meco began accepting energy from feed in tariff projects in as of december   there were  kw  kw and  kw of installed feed in tariff capacity from renewable energy technologies at heco  helco and meco  respectively 
as of december   there were  kw   kw and  kw of installed net energy metering capacity from renewable energy technologies mainly pv at heco  helco and meco  respectively 
net energy metering is proceeding at a record pace 
the amount of net energy metering capacity installed in was more than twice the amount installed in  which itself was at a record level 
other regulatory matters 
in addition to the items below  also see hawaii clean energy initiative and major projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
adequacy of supply 
heco 
in march  heco filed its adequacy of supply aos letter  which indicated that based on its may sales and peak forecast  heco s generation capacity for to is sufficient to meet reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 
the letter reported that  beginning in  heco anticipates that based on expected increasing demand it will begin experiencing reserve capacity shortfalls if no more firm generating capacity is added to the system and two generating units are retired at the end of these two generating units may be retired because of their age or more stringent environmental regulations 
also  two additional generating units may be retired in the timeframe 
at the time of the filing  heco estimated it would need approximately mw of new  firm generating capacity to replace the capacity that would be lost with the retirement of these four units and to accommodate load growth 
subsequently  heco developed its may sales and peak forecast  which was lower than its may sales and peak forecast 
with this lower forecast  heco expects the amount of new capacity needed to range from mw to mw and the timing to be dependent on the possible retirement of generating units 
helco 
in january  helco filed its aos letter  which indicated that helco s generation capacity through is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide for reasonable reserves for emergencies 
in march  helco added mw of renewable capacity from puna geothermal venture 
in may  helco executed a contract with an independent power producer to supply additional firm renewable capacity to the helco grid 
should this additional firm renewable facility come on line within the next two years as anticipated  helco will not have a need for additional firm capacity in the foreseeable future 
helco  however  may choose to add additional renewable generating capacity to replace existing nonrenewable generation 
in january  helco filed with the puc a proposed final geothermal rfp seeking up to mw of firm  dispatchable geothermal capacity 
meco 
in january  meco filed its aos letter  which indicated that meco s generation capacity through is sufficient to meet the forecasted demands on the islands of maui  lanai  and molokai  and also stated that meco expects to have adequate firm capacity for the period through and anticipates needing additional firm capacity on maui in the timeframe 
meco s activities  such as its plans to proceed with a competitive bidding process to acquire new  renewable firm dispatchable capacity generation resources on maui will be based on that estimated need date 
collective bargaining agreements 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislation and regulation 
congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
also see hawaii clean energy initiative and environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and recent tax developments above 
renewable energy 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that stated that the puc may consider the need for increased renewable energy in rendering decisions on utility matters 
due to this measure  it is possible that  if energy from a renewable source were more expensive than energy from fossil fuel  the puc may still approve the purchase of energy from the renewable source 
in  a bill became hawaii law act that authorizes preferential rates to agricultural energy producers selling electricity to utilities 
this will help support the long term development of locally grown biofuel crops  cultivating potential local renewable fuel sources for the utilities 
in addition  pursuant to act also adopted in  avoided cost is no longer a consideration in determining a just and reasonable rate for non fossil fuel generated electricity 
this will allow the utilities to negotiate purchased power prices for renewable energy that have the potential to be more stable and less costly than current pricing tied to avoided cost 
in  a hawaii law was enacted that gives the puc the authority to allow those electric utilities that aggregate their renewable portfolios to achieve the rps eg  heco  helco and meco to distribute the costs and expenses of renewable energy projects among those utilities 
the bill also allows the puc to establish a surcharge for such costs and expenses without a rate case filing 
also passed in  act provides for continued inclusion of customer sited  grid connected renewable energy generation in the rps calculations after this is the current practice in calculating rps levels  which provides electric utility ratepayers with a clear value from a program such as net energy metering

liquidity and capital resources 
management believes that heco s ability  and that of its subsidiaries  to generate cash  both internally from operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and lines of credit  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund their respective capital expenditures and investments and to cover debt  retirement benefits and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
heco s consolidated capital structure was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net preferred stock common stock equity information about heco s short term borrowings other than from helco and meco and line of credit facility were as follows year ended december  in millions average balance end of period balance december  short term borrowings commercial paper line of credit draws borrowings from hei undrawn capacity under line of credit facility expiring december  the maximum amount of external short term borrowings in was million 
at december   heco had million of short term borrowings from helco and meco had million of short term borrowings from heco  which borrowings are eliminated in consolidation 
at february   heco had million of outstanding commercial paper  its line of credit facility was undrawn  it had no borrowings from hei and it had borrowings of million from helco and a loan of million to meco 
heco utilizes short term debt  typically commercial paper  to support normal operations  to refinance short term debt and for other temporary requirements 
heco also borrows short term from hei for itself and on behalf of helco and meco  and heco may borrow from or loan to helco and meco short term 
the intercompany borrowings among the utilities  but not the borrowings from hei  are eliminated in the consolidation of heco s financial statements 
heco and its subsidiaries periodically utilize long term debt  historically borrowings of the proceeds of sprbs issued by the dbf and more recently the issuance of taxable unsecured senior notes  to finance the utilities capital improvement projects  or to repay short term borrowings used to finance such projects 
the puc must approve issuances  if any  of equity and long term debt securities by heco  helco and meco 
heco has a line of credit facility of million 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit agreement  amended in december  contains provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change 
for example  a ratings downgrade of heco s long term rating eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p and moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee increase of basis points and an interest rate increase of basis points on any drawn amounts 
on the other hand  a ratings upgrade eg  from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p or moody s  respectively would result in a commitment fee decrease of basis points and an interest rate decrease of basis points on any drawn amounts 
in addition to their impact on pricing under heco s credit agreement  the ratings of heco s commercial paper and debt securities could significantly impact the ability of heco to sell its commercial paper and issue debt securities and or the cost of such debt 
the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures eg  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of heco securities 
on august   moody s maintained heco s long term and short term commercial paper ratings and stable outlook  indicating that the ratings factor in the anticipated cash flow stability of this vertically integrated utility  the long term benefits of a more predictable regulatory framework being introduced  and a conservative financial management 
moody s indicated the rating could be downgraded if the hawaii puc does not follow through with the regulatory transformation contemplated under the hcei  including all elements of the decoupling mechanism or if the utilities cash flow to debt declined to below last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s and its cash flow coverage of interest fell below times times last twelve months as of march  latest reported by moody s for an extended period 
on november   s p maintained its long term ratings for heco  helco and meco of bbb and stable outlook 
in addition  s p maintained its a short term rating and aggressive financial risk and strong business risk profiles on heco 
s p indicated that although decoupling can benefit heco s financial profile over time  the company will also need constructive outcomes in future rate case filings 
also  heco needs resolution of the pending regulatory audits for previous capital spending for which the costs are currently deferred 
as of february   the s p and moody s ratings of heco securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p special purpose revenue bonds insured principal amount noted in parentheses  senior unsecured  insured as follows ambac assurance corporation million bbb baa financial guaranty insurance company billion bbb baa mbia insurance corporation billion bbb baa syncora guarantee inc formerly xl capital assurance inc 
billion bbb baa special purpose revenue bonds uninsured million bbb baa heco obligated preferred securities of trust subsidiary bb baa cumulative preferred stock selected series not rated baa the above ratings reflect only the view  at the time the ratings are issued  of the applicable rating agency  from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating corresponds to heco s rating senior unsecured debt rating by s p or issuer rating by moody s because  as a result of rating agency actions to lower or withdraw the ratings of these bond insurers after the bonds were issued  heco s current ratings are either higher than the current rating of the applicable bond insurer or the bond insurer is not rated 
following mbia insurance corporation s mbia s announced restructuring in february  the revenue bonds issued for the benefit of heco and its subsidiaries and insured by mbia have been reinsured by mbia insurance corp 
of illinois mbia illinois  whose name was subsequently changed to national public finance guarantee corp 
national 
the financial strength rating of national by s p is bbb 
moody s ratings on securities that are guaranteed or wrapped by a financial guarantor are generally maintained at a level equal to the higher of the rating of the guarantor if rated at the investment grade level or the published underlying rating 
the insurance financial strength rating of national by moody s is baa  which is lower than moody s issuer rating for heco 
management believes that  if heco s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded or if credit markets were to further tighten  it could be more difficult and or expensive to sell commercial paper or secure other short term borrowings 
similarly  management believes that if heco s long term credit ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets further tighten  it could be more difficult and or expensive for dbf and or the company to sell sprbs and other debt securities  respectively  for the benefit of the utilities in the future 
such limitations and or increased costs could materially adversely affect the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity of heco and its subsidiaries 
revenue bonds are issued by the dbf to finance capital improvement projects of heco and its subsidiaries  but the source of their repayment is the unsecured obligations of heco and its subsidiaries under loan agreements and notes issued to the dbf  including heco s guarantees of its subsidiaries obligations

the insured outstanding revenue bonds were initially issued with s p and moody s ratings of aaa and aaa  respectively  based on the ratings at the time of issuance of the applicable bond insurer 
beginning in  however  ratings of the insurers or their predecessors were downgraded and or withdrawn by s p and moody s  resulting in a downgrade of the bond ratings of all of the bonds as shown in the ratings table above 
management believes that if heco s long term credit ratings were to be downgraded  or if credit markets further tighten  it could be more difficult and or expensive to sell bonds in the future 
on november   the puc approved the request of heco  helco and meco for the sale of each utility s common stock over a five year period from through heco s sale to hei of up to million and helco and meco s sales to heco of up to million and million  respectively  and the purchase of helco and meco common stock by heco

operating activities provided million in net cash during investing activities used net cash of million  primarily for capital expenditures  net of contributions in aid of construction 
financing activities provided net cash of million from net increase in long term debt of million and net proceeds from issuance of common stock of million  partly offset by the payment of common and preferred stock dividends of million 
for the five year period through  the utilities forecast billion of net capital expenditures  approximately of which is for transmission and distribution projects  for generation projects and for general plant and other projects  with the remaining anticipated for major initiatives including environmental compliance and infrastructure investments for fuel and to integrate renewables into the system  which could change over time based upon external factors such as the timing and scope of environmental regulations  unforeseen delays in permitting and the outcome of competitive bidding for new generation 
heco s consolidated cash flows from operating activities net income for common stock  adjusted for non cash income and expense items such as depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  after the payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends  are currently not expected to provide sufficient cash to cover the forecasted net capital expenditures 
debt and equity financing are expected to be required to fund this estimated shortfall as well as to refinance maturing revenue bonds million in and to fund any unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs or acceleration of the construction of capital projects  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses and significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements 
proceeds from the issuances of debt and equity  cash flows from operating activities  temporary increases in short term borrowings and existing cash and cash equivalents are expected to provide the forecasted million needed for the net capital expenditures in for  net capital expenditures include approximately million for transmission and distribution projects  approximately million for generation projects and approximately million for general plant and other projects 
management periodically reviews capital expenditure estimates and the timing of construction projects 
these estimates may change significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  changes in forecasts of kwh sales and peak load  the availability of purchased power and changes in expectations concerning the construction and ownership of future generation units  the availability of generating sites and transmission and distribution corridors  the need for fuel infrastructure investments  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate increases  escalation in construction costs  commitments under the energy agreement  the effects of opposition to proposed construction projects and requirements of environmental and other regulatory and permitting authorities

hcei energy agreement 
heco  for itself and its subsidiaries  entered into the energy agreement on october  see hawaii clean energy initiative in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the far reaching nature of the energy agreement  including the extent of renewable energy commitments  present new increased risks to the company 
among such risks are the dependence on third party suppliers of renewable purchased energy  which if the utilities are unsuccessful in negotiating purchased power agreements with such ipps or if a major ipp fails to deliver the anticipated capacity in its purchased power agreement  could impact the utilities achievement of their commitments under the energy agreement and or the utilities ability to deliver reliable service  delays in acquiring or unavailability of non fossil fuel supplies for renewable generation  the impact of intermittent power to the electrical grid and reliability of service if appropriate supporting infrastructure is not installed or does not operate effectively  the likelihood that the utilities may need to make substantial investments in related infrastructure  which could result in increased borrowings and materially impact the financial condition and liquidity of the utilities  and the commitment to support a variety of initiatives  which  if approved by the puc  may have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the utilities depending on their design and implementation 
these initiatives include  but are not limited to  removing the system wide caps on net energy metering but studying dg interconnections on a per circuit basis  and developing an energy efficiency portfolio standard 
management cannot predict the ultimate impact or outcome of the implementation of these or other hcei programs on the results of operations  financial condition and liquidity of the electric utilities 
regulation of electric utility rates 
the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services  and the timeliness of permitted rate increases  are among the most important items influencing their results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the puc has broad discretion over the rates the electric utilities charge and other matters 
any adverse decision by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the items and amounts permitted to be included in rate base  the authorized returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the company s and heco s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o and interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest if the interim increase is greater than the increase approved in the final d o 
fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of fossil fuel oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in  and failure or delay by the electric utilities oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major ipp to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its ppa  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to days of forward consumption 
helco and meco generally maintain an inventory level equivalent to one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities ppas require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity ppas include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 
other operation and maintenance expenses 
other o m expenses increased in  was essentially flat in and increased in  when compared to the prior year  and respectively  excluding dsm program expenses 
o m expenses excluding expenses covered by surcharges or by third parties for are projected to be approximately higher than as the electric utilities expect to manage expenses to near levels 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project consisting of ct  ct and st and the east oahu transmission project  encountered opposition and were seriously delayed before being placed in service  with a writedown being required for both the keahole and eotp projects in and  respectively 
more recently  the utilities and the consumer advocate signed a settlement agreement  subject to approval by the puc  to write off million of costs in in lieu of conducting the regulatory audits of the cip ct and the cis projects 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional regulatory contingencies 
competition 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
the puc has promoted a more competitive electric industry environment through its decisions concerning competitive bidding and distributed generation 
competitive bidding 
in december  the puc issued a decision that included a final competitive bidding framework  which became effective immediately 
the final framework states  among other things  that a utility is required to use competitive bidding to acquire a future generation resource or a block of generation resources unless the puc finds bidding to be unsuitable  the framework does not apply in certain situations identified in the framework  waivers from competitive bidding for certain circumstances will be considered  the utility is required to select an independent observer from a list approved by the puc whenever the utility or its affiliate seeks to advance a project proposal ie  in competition with those offered by bidders  the utility may consider its own self bid proposals in response to generation needs identified in its rfp  and for any resource to which competitive bidding does not apply due to waiver or exemption  the utility retains its traditional obligation to offer to purchase capacity and energy from a qualifying facility qf at avoided cost upon reasonable terms and conditions approved by the puc 
the kalaeloa solar two photovoltaic energy ppa and the kawailoa wind windfarm ppa are two renewable projects that resulted from heco s renewable energy request for proposals rfp under the competitive bidding framework 
the utilities received puc approval for exemptions from the competitive framework to negotiate modifications to existing ppas that generate electricity from renewable resources  including the city county of honolulu s hpower facility expansion and the puna geothermal venture geothermal facility expansion 
also  certain renewable energy projects were grandfathered from the competitive bidding process  including the kahuku wind power  auwahi wind energy llc  and kaheawa wind power ii wind farms 
the puc can also grant waivers to renewable energy projects that are not exempt from the competitive bidding framework such as for the hu honua biomass facility 
distributed generation 
in january  the puc issued a d o indicating that its policy is to promote the development of a market structure that assures dg is available at the lowest feasible cost  dg that is economical and reliable has an opportunity to come to fruition and dg that is not cost effective does not enter the system 
the d o affirmed the ability of the utilities to procure and operate dg for utility purposes at utility sites 
the puc also indicated its desire to promote the development of a competitive market for customer sited dg 
the d o allows the utility to provide dg services on a customer owned site as a regulated service when the dg resolves a legitimate system need  the dg is the lowest cost alternative to meet that need and it can be shown that  in an open and competitive process acceptable to the puc  the customer operator was unable to find another entity ready and able to supply the proposed dg service at a price and quality comparable to the utility s offering 
environmental matters 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the hawaii department of health doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the federal environmental protection agency epa 
hawaii law requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
meeting this requirement results in increased project costs 
the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter resulted in substantial changes for the electric utility industry such as the installation of additional emissions controls  retirements of older generating units and switches to lower emissions fuels 
further significant impacts may occur under newly adopted rules eg  one hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide  control of ghgs under the ghg psd and title v tailoring rule  under rules deemed applicable to the utilities facilities eg  regional haze rule  if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted eg  ghg emission reduction rules  or if new legislation  rules or standards are adopted in the future 
similarly  soon to be issued rules governing cooling water intake may significantly impact heco s steam generating facilities on oahu 
additional environmental compliance costs are expected to be incurred as a result of the initiatives called for in the energy agreement  including permitting and siting costs for new facilities and testing and permitting costs related to changing to the use of biofuels 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc  but no assurance can be given that this will in fact be the case 
in addition  there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities or that the related costs will be recoverable through rates 
see environmental regulation in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of energy storage  fuel cells  dg and generation from renewable sources may impact the electric utility s future competitive position  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
heco and its subsidiaries evaluate the impact of applying lease accounting standards to their new ppas  ppa amendments and other arrangements they enter into 
a possible outcome of the evaluation is that an arrangement results in its classification as a capital lease  which could have a material effect on heco s consolidated balance sheet if a significant amount of capital assets of the ipp and lease obligations needed to be recorded 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed costs at that time 
see the discussion under major projects in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs of major projects that have not yet been approved for inclusion in the applicable utility s rate base 
regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with accounting standards for regulatory operations  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because their recovery in future customer rates is probable 
as of december   the consolidated regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets of the utilities amounted to million and million  respectively  compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes that the recovery of the regulatory assets as of december  is probable 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the electric utilities expect that the regulatory assets would be charged to expense and the regulatory liabilities would be credited to income or refunded to ratepayers immediately 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense or if regulatory liabilities are required to be refunded to ratepayers immediately 
revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period  but not yet billed to customers  and rba revenues or refunds for the difference between puc approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues  which delinks revenues from kilowatthour sales 
as of december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million and the rba revenues recognized in amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
the rate schedules of the electric utilities include ecacs under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
the rate schedules of the electric utilities also include ppacs under which electric rates are more closely aligned with purchase power costs incurred 
management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may result if the ecacs or ppacs were lost 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
a business enterprise must evaluate whether it should consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
the company evaluates the impact of applying accounting standards for consolidation to its relationships with ipps with whom the utilities execute new ppas or execute amendments of existing ppas 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes

additional information concerning heco is incorporated herein by reference to page of heco exhibit bank executive overview and strategy 
when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth  but has been optimizing its balance sheet in recent years as a result of its multi year performance improvement project  which has resulted in a reduction in asset size and a concomitant improvement in profitability and capital efficiency 
asb ended with assets of billion and net income of million  compared to assets of billion as of december  and net income of million in asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers 
in order to remain competitive and continue building core franchise value  asb continues to develop and introduce new products and services in order to meet the needs of those markets such as mobile banking 
additionally  the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is making the investments in people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive 
asb s ongoing challenge is to continue to increase revenues and control expenses after the completion of its performance improvement project 
the interest rate environment and the quality of asb s assets will continue to impact its financial results 
asb continues to face a challenging interest rate environment 
the persistent  low level of interest rates and excess liquidity in the financial system have impacted the new loan production rates and made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns  which resulted in a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
the potential for compression of asb s margin when interest rates rise is an ongoing concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost  core deposits  particularly those in non interest bearing transaction accounts  reducing the overall exposure to fixed rate residential mortgage loans and diversifying the loan portfolio with higher spread  shorter maturity loans and or variable rate loans such as commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans  managing costing liabilities to optimize cost of funds and manage interest rate sensitivity  and focusing new investments on shorter duration or variable rate securities 
asb s loan quality improved in as a result of stabilized or increasing property values  more financial flexibility of borrowers  and overall general economic improvement in the state of hawaii 
the slowdown in the economy  both nationally and locally  had resulted in asb experiencing higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses  which were concentrated in the residential land portfolio and on the neighbor islands 
the residential land portfolio has declined  which has enabled asb to release some loan loss reserves on that portfolio 
although asb s provision for loan losses had decreased in compared to  it is still at an elevated level compared to several years of historically low loan losses and loan loss allowances 
while a gradual recovery was experienced in as the global economic recovery began to take hold  many challenges remain and the outlook for the hawaii economy is for a slow  steady recovery 
consumers and businesses are expected to recover slowly in as gradual improvement in measures such as job growth  unemployment and real personal income are expected 
continued financial stress on asb s customers may result in higher levels of loan delinquencies and losses 
results of operations

asb s average loan portfolio balance for was million higher than as the average commercial markets  home equity lines of credit and commercial real estate loan balances increased by million  million and million  respectively 
asb targeted these loan types because of their shorter duration and or variable rates 
despite a million increase in residential loan production  the average residential loan portfolio decreased by million due to higher repayments and loan sales in connection with asb s long term strategy to manage interest rate risk 
the loan portfolio yield was impacted by the low interest rate environment as new loan production yields were lower than the average portfolio yield 
the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolio balance decreased by million as asb experienced higher prepayments on the portfolio  which were used to fund higher loan originations 
noninterest income higher gain on sale of loans as more residential loans were sold in order to manage interest rate risk and increase in debit card fees due to an increase in transaction volume 
the higher gain on sale revenue helped fund spending on asb s strategic priorities 
revenues interest expense lower funding costs as a result of the low interest rate environment 
average deposit balances for increased by million compared to due to an increase in core deposits of million  partly offset by a decrease in term certificates of million 
the other borrowings average balance decreased by million due to the payoff of a maturing fhlb advance in and lower retail repurchase agreements 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses benefited from lower net charge offs and improved credit quality associated with the gradual improvement in hawaii s economy  partly offset by loan loss reserves established for the growth in the loan portfolio 
noninterest expense higher transaction volumes and spending on asb s strategic projects and priorities  as well as increasing employee benefit expenses 
expenses operating income lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses  partially offset by higher noninterest income 
net income lower operating income 
return on average common equity vs

asb s average loan portfolio balance was million higher than the average loan portfolio balance as the average commercial markets and home equity lines of credit loan balances increased by million and million  respectively 
asb targeted these loan types because of their shorter duration and variable rates 
offsetting these loan portfolio increases was a decrease in the average residential loan portfolio balance of million due to lower production and asb s decision to sell a portion of the residential loan production 
the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolio balance increased by million as asb purchased securities with its excess liquidity 
noninterest income lower fee income on deposits as a result of new overdraft fee legislation 
revenues interest expense lower funding costs as a result of the low interest rate environment 
average deposit balances for increased by million compared to balances due to an increase in core deposits of million  partly offset by a decrease in term certificates of million 
the other borrowings average balance decreased by million due to lower retail repurchase agreements 
provision for loan losses decrease primarily due to lower loan loss reserves for the commercial markets portfolio as a result of lower historical loss ratios in and lower loan loss reserves for the residential land portfolio due to the contraction of the portfolio 
asb s nonaccrual and renegotiated loans represented and of total outstanding loans as of december  and  respectively 
noninterest expense lower data processing expense due to lower service bureau expenses with the system conversion in mid expenses operating income lower net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by lower provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
net income lower operating income  partly offset by lower taxes primarily due to additional low income housing credits and tax free income from municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance

defined as net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets 
earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities 
the current interest rate environment was impacted by disruptions in the financial markets and these conditions may continue and have a negative impact on asb s net interest margin 
loan originations and mortgage related securities are asb s primary sources of earning assets 
loan portfolio 
asb s loan volumes and yields are affected by market interest rates  competition  demand for financing  availability of funds and management s responses to these factors 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s loans receivable 
the increase in the total loan portfolio from billion at the end of to billion at the end of was primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate and home equity line of credit loan portfolios  which asb targeted because of their shorter duration and or variable rates partly offset by lower residential loan balances 
loan portfolio risk elements 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly  the loan is classified as delinquent 
if delinquencies are not cured promptly  asb normally commences a collection action  including foreclosure proceedings in the case of secured loans 
in a foreclosure action  the property securing the delinquent debt is sold at a public auction in which asb may participate as a bidder to protect its interest 
if asb is the successful bidder  the property is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
see allowance for loan losses in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to nonperforming assets 
the level of nonperforming loans reflects the impact of current unemployment levels in hawaii and the weak economic environment globally  nationally and in hawaii 
allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the tables which sets forth the allocation of asb s allowance for loan losses 
for  the allowance for loan losses increased by million due to growth in the loan portfolios growth or million increase in outstanding balances and higher impairment reserves for the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
although overall loan quality improved  a number of commercial borrowers experienced financial stress during the year

as of december   asb s investment portfolio consisted of mortgage related securities issued by federal national mortgage association fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or government national mortgage association gnma  federal agency obligations and municipal bonds 
principal and interest on mortgage related securities issued by fnma  fhlmc and gnma are guaranteed by the issuer and  in the case of gnma  backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
the unrealized gains on asb s investment in federal agency mortgage backed securities were primarily caused by lower interest rates 
the low interest rate environment coupled with tighter spreads on all mortgage collateralized securities caused the market value of the securities held to increase above the carrying book value 
all contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the us government 
see investment and mortgage related securities in note for a discussion of securities impairment assessment 
as of december   and  asb did not have any private issue mortgage related securities 
deposits and other borrowings 
deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for asb and are affected by market interest rates  competition and management s responses to these factors 
deposit retention and growth will remain challenging in the current environment due to competition for deposits and the low level of short term interest rates 
advances from the fhlb of seattle and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be additional sources of funds 
as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings 
as of december   asb s costing liabilities consisted of deposits and other borrowings 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for the composition of asb s deposit liabilities and other borrowings 
other factors 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations and also represents a market risk factor affecting the fair value of asb s investment securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of those instruments  respectively 
in addition  changes in credit spreads also impact the fair values of those instruments 
as of december  and  asb had unrealized gains  net of taxes  on available for sale investments and mortgage related securities including securities pledged for repurchase agreements in aoci of million and million  respectively 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
legislation and regulation 
asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on asb s level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholder

dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act 
regulation of the financial services industry  including regulation of hei and asb  has changed and will continue to change as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act  which became law in july importantly for hei and asb  under the dodd frank act  on july   all of the functions of the office of thrift supervision ots transferred to the occ  the fdic  the federal reserve board frb and the consumer financial protection bureau bureau 
supervision and regulation of hei  as a thrift holding company  moved to the frb  and supervision and regulation of asb  as a federally chartered savings bank  moved to the occ 
while the laws and regulations applicable to hei and asb did not generally change  the applicable laws and regulations are being interpreted  and new and amended regulations may be adopted  by the frb and the occ 
hei will be subject to minimum consolidated capital requirements  and asb may be required to be supervised through ashi  its intermediate holding company 
the dodd frank act requires regulators  at a minimum  to apply to bank and thrift holding companies leverage and risk based capital standards that are at least as strict as those in effect at the insured depository institution level on the date the act became effective  although there will be a phase in period for meeting these standards 
in addition  hei will continue to be required to serve as a source of strength to asb in the event of its financial distress 
the dodd frank act also imposes new restrictions on the ability of a savings bank to pay dividends should it fail to remain a qualified thrift lender 
more stringent affiliate transaction rules now apply to asb in the securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives areas 
standards were raised with respect to the ability of asb to merge with or acquire another institution 
in reviewing a potential merger or acquisition  the approving federal agency will need to consider the extent to which the proposed transaction will result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system 
the dodd frank act established the bureau 
it has authority to prohibit practices it finds to be unfair  deceptive or abusive  and it may also issue rules requiring specified disclosures and the use of new model forms 
on december   the bureau issued the remittance rule an amendment to regulation e which closes for comment on january  for international wires  the rule now provides flexibility regarding the disclosure of foreign taxes  as well as fees imposed by a designated recipient s institution for receiving a remittance transfer in an account 
second  the rule limits a remittance transfer provider s obligation to disclose foreign taxes to those imposed by a country s central government 
and third  the rule revises the error resolution provisions that apply when a remittance transfer is not delivered to a designated recipient because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information  and  in particular  when a sender provides an incorrect account number and that incorrect account number results in the funds being deposited in the wrong account 
on january   the bureau issued the ability to repay rule which closes for comment on february  for mortgages  among other things  i potential borrowers have to supply financial information  and lenders must verify it  ii to qualify for a particular loan  a consumer has to have sufficient assets or income to pay back the loan  and iii lenders will have to determine the consumer s ability to repay both the principal and the interest over the long term not just during an introductory period when the rate may be lower 
asb may also be subject to new state regulation because of a provision in the dodd frank act that acknowledges that a federal savings bank may be subject to state regulation and allows federal law to preempt a state consumer financial law on a case by case basis only when the state law would have a discriminatory effect on the bank compared to that on a bank chartered in that state  the state law prevents or significantly interferes with a bank s exercise of its power  or the state law is preempted by another federal law 
the dodd frank act also adopts a number of provisions that will impact the mortgage industry  including the imposition of new specific duties on the part of mortgage originators such as asb to act in the best interests of consumers and to take steps to ensure that consumers will have the capability to repay loans they may obtain  as well as provisions imposing new disclosure requirements and requiring appraisal reforms 
the durbin amendment to the dodd frank act required the frb to issue rules to ensure that debit card interchange fees are reasonable and proportional to the processing costs incurred 
in june  the frb issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
under the final rule  effective october   the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is cents  depending on certain components 
for  asb had earned an average of cents per transaction 
as specified in the dodd frank act  these regulations will exempt banks like asb  that  along with their affiliates  have less than billion in assets 
however  market pressures could cause all banks to observe this limitation 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  as amended  will not become effective until implementing regulations are issued and effective 
proposed capital rules 
the frb  occ and fdic issued three notices of proposed rulemaking npr that would revise and replace the current capital rules 
the proposed rules are intended to help ensure banks maintain strong capital positions  which would enable them to continue lending to creditworthy households and businesses even after unforeseen losses and during severe economic downturns 
the first npr  titled regulatory capital rules regulatory capital  implementation of basel iii  minimum regulatory capital ratios  capital adequacy  and transition provisions basel iii npr  applies to all depository institutions  bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and savings and loan holding companies and revises the risk based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the basel committee on banking supervision basel iii 
the basel iii npr would increase the quantity and quality of capital required  revise the definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses  establish limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if additional specified amounts of common equity tier capital are not met  and introduce a supplementary leverage ratio for internationally active banking organizations 
the basel iii npr would also revise the prompt corrective action framework by incorporating new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity 
the second npr  titled regulatory capital rules standardized approach for risk weighted assets  market discipline and disclosure requirements standardized approach npr  proposes to revise and harmonize the rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over the past several years 
the standardized approach npr would incorporate aspects of the basel ii standardized framework such as methods for determining risk weighted assets for residential mortgages  securitization exposures and counterparty credit risk 
the standardized approach npr would apply to the same set of institutions as the basel iii npr  but also introduces disclosure requirements for us banking organizations with billion or more in assets 
the third npr  regulatory capital rules advanced approaches risk based capital rule market risk capital rule advanced approaches npr  would apply to banking organizations that are subject to the banking agencies advanced approaches rule  or to their market risk rule  and revises the advanced approaches risk based capital rules to be consistent with basel iii and the dodd frank act 
generally  the advanced approaches rules would apply to institutions with billion or more in consolidated assets or billion or more in foreign exposure  and the market risk rule would apply to savings and loan holding companies with significant trading activity 
proposed capital requirements proposal effective dates capital conservation buffer common equity ratio conservation buffer tier capital ratio conservation buffer total capital ratio conservation buffer countercyclical capital buffer not applicable to asb the proposed rules allow for a transition period to meet the proposed capital requirement levels 
asb is reviewing the proposed rules and the impact to its capital ratios 
based on a preliminary assessment  management believes asb and hei can satisfy the proposed capital rules that would be applicable to them  if adopted 
fhlb of seattle stock 
as of december   asb s investment in stock of the fhlb of seattle of million was carried at cost because it can only be redeemed at par 
there is a minimum required investment in such stock based on measurements of asb s capital  assets and or borrowing levels  and asb s investment is substantially in excess of that requirement 
the fhlb of seattle reported net income of million for the nine months ended september  compared to net income of million for the nine months ended september  the fhlb of seattle reported retained earnings of million as of september  and was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements 
in october  the fhlb of seattle entered into a stipulation and consent to the issuance of a consent order with the federal housing finance agency finance agency  which requires the fhlb of seattle to take certain actions related to its business and operations 
the consents provide that  following a stabilization period and once the fhlb of seattle reaches and maintains certain thresholds  it may redeem or repurchase capital stock and begin paying dividends 
asb does not believe that the consents will affect the fhlb of seattle s ability to meet asb s liquidity and funding needs 
the fhlb of seattle did not pay any cash dividends in  or in september  the finance agency classified the fhlb of seattle as adequately capitalized and after receiving approval from the finance agency  began repurchasing excess stock 
the fhlb of seattle repurchased a total of million of excess stock from asb in september and december of commitments and contingencies

liquidity and capital resources 
december change change dollars in millions total assets available for sale investment and mortgage related securities loans receivable held for investment  net deposit liabilities other bank borrowings as of december   asb was one of hawaii s largest financial institutions based on assets of billion and deposits of billion 
asb s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  borrowings and the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities 
asb s deposits as of december  were million higher than december  asb s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker dealers 
as of december   fhlb borrowings totaled million  representing of assets 
asb is approved to borrow from the fhlb up to of asb s assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
as of december   asb s unused fhlb borrowing capacity was approximately billion 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million  representing of assets 
asb utilizes deposits  advances from the fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans and purchase investment and mortgage related securities 
as of december   asb had commitments to borrowers for undisbursed loan funds  loan commitments and unused lines and letters of credit of billion 
there are no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans are impaired 
there are no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in trouble debt restructurings as of december  management believes asb s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels 
as of december  and  asb had million and million of loans on nonaccrual status  respectively  or and of net loans outstanding  respectively 
as of december  and  asb had million and million  respectively  of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
in  operating activities provided cash of million 
net cash of million was used by investing activities primarily due to purchases of investment and mortgage related securities  a net increase in loans held for investment and capital expenditures  partly offset by repayments of investment and mortgage related securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage related securities and real estate 
financing activities provided net cash of million due to a net increase in deposits  partly offset by a decrease in other borrowings and the payment of common stock dividends 
asb believes that maintaining a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence  affords protection to depositors  helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions  such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized see regulation capital requirements below for asb s capital ratios 
for a discussion of asb dividends  see common stock equity in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
also see forward looking statements and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition for consolidated hei above 
competition 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is one of hawaii s largest financial institutions  based on total assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb is a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher spread  shorter duration consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
us capital markets and credit and interest rate environment 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
persistent low levels of interest rates have made it challenging to find investments with adequate risk adjusted returns and had a negative impact on asb s asset yields and net interest margin 
if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s net interest margin will continue 
asb also manages the credit risk associated with its lending and securities portfolios  but a deep and prolonged recession led by a material decline in housing prices could materially impair the value of its portfolios 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
technological developments 
new technological developments eg  significant advances in internet banking may impact asb s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
prior to extending a loan collateralized by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
regulation 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the department of treasury  occ and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the occ 
capital requirements 
the occ  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with occ minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of occ prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses as of december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses as of december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to hei through ashi and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei currently could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary  to maintain asb s capital position 
examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the occ 
in conducting its examinations  the occ utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the occ examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the occ s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the occ also regularly examines asb s information technology practices and its performance under community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 
qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
institutions that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  ashi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if asb failed to maintain its qtl status  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of asb s assets were qualified thrift investments 
unitary savings and loan holding company 
the gramm leach bliley act of gramm act permitted banks  insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricted the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  ashi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 
there have been legislative proposals in the past which would operate to eliminate the thrift charter or the grandfathered status of hei as a unitary thrift holding company and effectively require the divestiture of asb 
material estimates and critical accounting policies 
also see material estimates and critical accounting policies for consolidated hei above 
investment and mortgage related securities 
asb owns federal agency obligations and mortgage related securities issued by the fnma  gnma and fhlmc and municipal bonds  all of which are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in aoci 
asb views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy since the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see investment and mortgage related securities in note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of securities impairment assessment and other than temporary impaired securities 
prices for investments and mortgage related securities are provided by an independent third party pricing service and are based on observable inputs  including historical trading levels or sector yields  using market based valuation techniques 
the price of these securities is generally based on observable inputs  which include market liquidity  credit considerations of the underlying collateral  the levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns and overall market psychology 
to validate the accuracy and completeness of security pricing  a separate third party pricing service is used on a quarterly basis to compare prices that were received from the initial third party pricing service 
if the pricing differential between the two pricing sources exceeds an established threshold  the security price will be re evaluated by sending a re pricing request to both independent third party pricing services  to another third party vendor  or to an independent broker to determine the most accurate price based on all observable inputs found in the market place 
the third party price selected will be based on the value that best reflects the data and observable characteristics of the security 
as of december   asb had investment and mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion 
allowance for loan losses 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussion above under earning assets  costing liabilities and other factors 
as of december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
in  asb recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the credit risk ratings assigned to asb s loan portfolio and loss ratios inherent in the asb loan portfolio at any given point in time 
a sensitivity analysis provides insight regarding the impact that adverse changes in credit risk ratings may have on asb s allowance for loan losses 
at december   in the event that of the homogenous loans move down one delinquency classification eg  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category  of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of the loans in the days delinquent category move to the days delinquent category and of non homogenous loans were downgraded one credit risk rating category for each category eg  of the loans in the pass category moved to the special mention category  of the loans in the special mention category moved to the substandard category  of the loans in the substandard category moved to the doubtful category and of the loans in the doubtful category moved to the loss category  the allowance for loan losses would have increased by approximately million 
the sensitivity analyses do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in asb loans risk ratings and they do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for loan losses due to the numerous quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determining asb s allowance for loan losses 
the example above is only one of a number of possible scenarios 
although management believes asb s allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy or real estate market  and material increases in those amounts could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei and heco in the case of heco  only the information related to heco and its subsidiaries the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and the other segment s exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with asb s lending portfolios is controlled through its underwriting standards  loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated through investment portfolio limits  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to the fuel supply and ipp contracts of the electric utilities 
the company s commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as the electric utilities have their current ecacs in their rate schedules 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
the company currently has no exposure to market risk from trading activities nor foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities  the market value of retirement benefit plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 
bank interest rate risk the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk irr 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
many other factors also affect asb s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and competition for loans or deposits 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
see note of hei s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management of asb measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios are created by assuming rate ramps or gradual interest changes and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion  over the next twelve month period  in increments of basis points 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets  future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities  and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
other nii sensitivity analysis may include scenarios such as yield curve twists or non static balance sheet changes such as changes to key balance sheet drivers 
consistent with occ guidelines  the market value or economic capitalization of asb is measured as economic value of equity eve 
eve represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s eve include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  pricing spreads for assets and liabilities in the alternate scenarios and the rate and balance behavior of deposit accounts with indeterminate maturities 
eve is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points bp up to bp 
the change in eve is measured as the change in eve in a given rate scenario from the base case and expressed as a percentage 
to gain further insight into the irr profile  additional analysis is periodically performed in alternate scenarios including rate shifts of greater magnitude  yield curve twists and changes in key balance sheet drivers 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in interest rates change in nii change in eve change in nii change in eve basis points gradual change instantaneous change gradual change instantaneous change base management believes that asb s interest rate risk position as of december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
the nii profile under the rising interest rate scenarios is asset sensitive for all rate increases as of december  compared to december  due to changes in assumption about the repricing of certain commercial loans 
asb s base eve was million as of december  compared to million as of december  due to changes in discounting spreads for certain retail loans and changes in mix for core deposits 
the change in eve was more sensitive in the rising scenarios as of december  compared to december  due to the shift in the investment portfolio towards a longer duration mix  and changes in the mix of retail loans and core deposits 
the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity and the percentage change in eve is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pretax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk
