item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems  including sourcing from some single suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry can experience some tightness of supply of certain materials or availability of transportation systems 
in addition  in some cases  we choose to source from a single supplier 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or to utilize transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
several of the products we sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of these production facilities 
these production facilities are subject to various hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacturing and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive  and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows in any given period 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
our inability to maintain a highly qualified technical workforce or their inability to anticipate  respond to  or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows in any given period 
our research and development efforts are costly and may not succeed 
the petroleum additives industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our profits and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in profits 
additionally  for any new product program  
table of contents there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial product needed to maintain our competitive position  or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark  and copyright law  as well as judicial enforcement  to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued and pending us and foreign patents 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise 
we have developed  and may in the future develop  technologies with universities or other academic institutions  or with the use of government funding 
in such cases  the academic institution or the government may retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property 
we also own several hundred trademark and service mark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including newmarket  afton chemical  ethyl  hitec  tecgard  greenburn  biotec  passion for solutions  cleanstart  polartech  and mmt  as well as pending trademark and service mark applications  including axcel tm and quickresponse sm 
in the event that we are unable to continue using certain of our marks  we may be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertise and market brands 
in particular  the loss of our hitec mark could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we were found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operation 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment  and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents operations as a whole  including our results of operation or cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations  decrease demand for our products  and increase our expenses 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation has imposed significant new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities that will increase our annual overhead expenses 
federal regulations have also been enacted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
further regulations could be enacted in the future  which could result in additional costs 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  but their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we manufacture 
in addition  as a result of price competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  antioxidants  alcohols  solvents  sulfonates  friction modifiers  olefins  and copolymers 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused  and may continue to cause  the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest  or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by the concentration of a few large participants as a result of consolidation 
the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in purchases by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline 
table of contents prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for over of consolidated revenue 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and or economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  europe  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary or unstable economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and our ability to repay or service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our debt  service our indebtedness  or to fund other liquidity needs 
furthermore  although substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries  we cannot guarantee that our subsidiaries will be able to distribute funds to us for that purpose 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operation 
we conduct our business in the local currency of many of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operation of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  as well as our revenues  costs  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
an information technology system failure may adversely affect our business 
we rely on information technology systems to transact our business 
an information technology system failure due to computer viruses  internal or external security breaches  power interruptions  hardware failures  fire  natural disasters  human error  or other causes could disrupt our operations and prevent us from being able to process transactions with our customers  operate our manufacturing facilities  and properly report those transactions in a timely manner 
a significant  protracted information technology system failure may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 

table of contents our business is subject to government regulation and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and our facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate sales from those products 
new laws and regulations  including climate change regulations  may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall  or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
our business and our customers are subject to significant regulations under the european commission s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation 
it imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports  including testing data  on each chemical substance  perform chemical safety assessments  and obtain pre market authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern 
the regulation imposes additional burdens on chemical producers and importers  and  to a lesser extent  downstream users of chemical substances and preparations 
our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur additional compliance costs 
we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  the us bribery act and anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business 
we are also subject to export and import laws and regulations which restrict trading with embargoed or sanctioned countries 
although we have policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations  our employees  contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 
legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  tel  premises asbestos liability  and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims  or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operation 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  as well as surface and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines 
table of contents and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with laws  regulations  statutes  and ordinances protecting the environment  including those related to the discharge of materials 
however  we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
noncompliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits  or the suspension and potential cessation of noncompliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows even if we did not create or cause the problem 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability  property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage  or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned or operated  regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination  or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
within the united states  we are subject to the federal  state  and local environmental laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
in de minimis prp matters and in some minor prp matters  we generally negotiate a consent decree to pay an apportioned settlement 
this relieves us of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
we are also a prp at sites where our liability may be in excess of the de minimis or minor prp levels 
most sites where we are a prp represent environmental issues that are quite mature 
the sites have been investigated  and in many cases  the remediation methodology  as well as the proportionate shares of each prp  has been established 
other sites are not as mature  which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of future clean up or remediation costs 
generally  environmental remediation and monitoring will go on for an extended period 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years 

table of contents liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third party waste disposal sites is joint and several 
currently  we are involved in active remediation efforts at several sites where we have been named a prp 
if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to the remediation costs  we could be held responsible for some  or all  of their portion of the remediation costs  in addition to the portion of these costs for which we are already responsible 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our revolving credit facility and senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
landlord and financing risks associated with foundry park i could adversely affect our financial results 
in january  foundry park i entered into a deed of lease agreement with meadwestvaco under which it is leasing an office building which we have constructed on approximately three acres in richmond  virginia 
our landlord and financing activities may subject us to the following risks we may incur costs associated with our landlord activities that exceed our expectations and result in the foundry park i operations materially negatively impacting our results of operation for our real estate development segment  and we may incur losses  which could be material  under the goldman sachs interest rate swap agreement 
see note for further information on the interest rate swap 
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in completing acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition  or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which complicates gauging our performance 
external factors beyond our control  such as timing of customer orders  product shipment dates  and other factors can cause shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our results of operation and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and gauging trends in our business may be impaired 

table of contents we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension plans  which may be underfunded due to any underperformance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans actual return on assets 
reductions in our plans return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be underfunded and require us to make additional cash contributions

table of contents item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund 
some of these legal proceedings relate to environmental matters and involve governmental authorities 
for further information  see environmental in part i  item while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  we believe the outcome of any of these proceedings  or all of them combined  will not result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operation  financial condition  or cash flows

the percentage of revenue being generated from these regions has remained fairly consistent over the past three years  with some limited fluctuation due to various factors  including economic downturns 
north america represents approximately of our petroleum additives revenues  while emeai represents about 
asia pacific contributes approximately and latin america represents almost 
the emeai percentage has decreased slightly over the three year period due partially to economic conditions in the countries comprising the emeai region and the normal fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the percentages of the other regions have increased slightly over the past three years 
as shown in the table above  the percentage of lubricant additives sales and fuel additives sales has remained substantially consistent over the past three years 
the discussion below provides further detail on revenue in our petroleum additives segment for   and petroleum additives net sales for of billion were approximately higher than levels  with increases in all regions except the emeai region  which was approximately lower in than the increase between the two years primarily resulted from higher selling prices  offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact 
while product shipments decreased in from levels  the volume impact on net sales was slightly favorable when comparing the two years due to changes in the mix of products sold during  as we sold more higher priced lubricant additive products 
the lower product shipments were across both the lubricant and fuel additive product lines 
we have experienced some impact from economic downturns in different countries  including those in the emeai region  but those impacts have been essentially offset by the other favorable factors discussed above

nonetheless  selling increased volumes of higher valued products contributed approximately of the improvement in gross profit between and the remaining improvement in gross profit between and was due to favorable comparisons on selling prices which contributed approximately 
raw material costs were also favorable  while manufacturing conversion costs were unfavorable 
both product shipments and selling prices were significantly higher when comparing and the favorable impact from the increase in shipments represented approximately of the increase in gross profit in over levels 
while selling prices were significantly higher when comparing the two years  the impact from the higher selling prices was substantially offset by unfavorable raw material costs and unfavorable manufacturing conversion costs

most r d is incurred in the united states and in the united kingdom  with almost of total r d being attributable to the north america and emeai regions 
all expenses for new product development are incurred in the united states and the united kingdom 
the remaining near of r d is attributable to the asia pacific and latin america regions and represents customer technology support services in those regions 
r d includes personnel related costs  as well as the costs of performing the tests that are required to demonstrate the efficacy of our products 
all of our r d is related to the petroleum additives segment

the following discussion references certain captions on the consolidated statements of income 
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in interest and financing expenses between and resulted from both a lower average interest rate and lower average outstanding debt 
the lower average rate contributed million of the difference  while the lower average outstanding debt resulted in a million decrease in interest and financing expenses between and fees and amortization increased million in over 
table of contents the increase in interest and financing expenses between and was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt reflecting higher borrowings on the revolving credit facility  which was partially offset by a lower average interest rate during the increase in debt between and contributed million to the increase  with an offsetting million decrease due to the lower average interest rate 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million in the loss resulted from the recognition of million of unamortized deferred financing costs on our previous revolving credit facility  million from the early redemption premium on the senior notes  million of unamortized deferred financing costs on the senior notes  and million from unamortized deferred financing costs on the mortgage loan 
of the total loss on early extinguishment of debt  approximately million was a cash payment 
the remaining amounts were a noncash charge 
other expense  net other expense  net was million in  million in  and million in the amount includes a gain of million related to the sale of common stock that was received in september as part of the legal settlement with innospec  which is discussed further in note the amount includes million of expense related to the consents we obtained in january from the holders of the senior notes to modify the formula for calculating the capacity under the senior notes to make certain restricted payments 
the remaining amounts for   and primarily represent the loss on an interest rate swap which is recorded at fair value 
see note for additional information on the interest rate swap 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in  million in  and million in the effective tax rate was in and in both and the effective income tax rates for each year include the benefit of higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates  as well as a substantial benefit from the domestic manufacturing tax deduction 
a benefit from the r d tax credit is included for and however  the r d tax credit was not available for  as the credit for was not signed into law until january the tax rate for includes a substantial tax benefit related to the special dividend of per share which was paid in december see note for further details on income taxes 
the increase in income before income tax expense between and resulted in an increase of million in income tax expense 
this was partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense of million due to the lower effective tax rate in compared to the increase in income before income tax expense between and resulted in the entire increase in income tax expense of million 
our deferred taxes are in a net asset position 
based on current forecasted operating plans and historical profitability  we believe that we will recover nearly the full benefit of our deferred tax assets and have  therefore  only recorded an immaterial valuation allowance at a foreign subsidiary 
cash flows discussion we generated cash from operating activities of million in  million in  and million in during  we used the million cash generated from operations  along with million from the issuance of the senior notes  million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and million in proceeds from the sale of innospec common stock to fund million in dividend payments including million of a special dividend payment  redeem million of the senior notes  pay in full million on the mortgage loan  and fund million of capital expenditures 
in addition  we made a net deposit of million and a net settlement of million related to the goldman sachs interest rate swap and funded million for debt issuance costs 
further information on the goldman sachs interest rate swap is in note these items  including a favorable fluctuation in foreign currency rates of million  resulted in an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows from operating activities 
table of contents included a decrease of million resulting from higher working capital requirements  as well as payments of million for our pension and postretirement plans 
during  we used the cash provided by operating activities of million  along with million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and an additional million of borrowings under foreign lines of credit to fund million in capital expenditures  million in repurchases of our common stock  and million in dividend payments 
in addition  we made a net deposit of million and a net settlement payment of million related to the goldman sachs interest rate swap  and funded million for debt issuance costs 
these cash flows  including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million  resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash flows from operating activities included a decrease of million resulting from higher working capital requirements and payments of million for our pension and postretirement plans  as well as million proceeds from a legal settlement 
during  we utilized the million of cash generated from operations and million of cash on hand  along with the borrowing of million under the mortgage loan for foundry park i and million under the revolving credit facility to fund several key initiatives 
these initiatives included repaying the foundry park i construction loan of million 
we also funded the acquisition of polartech for million  funded capital expenditures of million  repurchased million of our common stock  paid million of dividends on our common stock  made a net deposit of million and a net settlement payment of million related to the goldman sachs interest rate swap  and paid million for debt issuance costs 
these cash flows included an unfavorable foreign currency impact on cash of million 
cash flows from operating activities included a decrease of million resulting from higher working capital requirements and payments of million for our pension and postretirement plans 
we expect that cash from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility  will continue to be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
financial position and liquidity cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at the end of at both december  and december   we had a book overdraft for some of our disbursement cash accounts 
a book overdraft represents disbursements that have not cleared the bank accounts at the end of the reporting period 
we transfer cash on an as needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank in subsequent periods 
our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  a significant amount  but not all  of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested 
we plan to use these indefinitely reinvested earnings to support growth outside of the united states through funding of operating expenses  research and development expenses  capital expenditures  and other cash needs of our foreign subsidiaries 
periodically  we repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states through intercompany dividends 
these intercompany dividends are paid only by subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted are indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as previously taxed income  as defined by the internal revenue code 
if circumstances were to change that would cause these indefinitely reinvested earnings to be repatriated  an incremental us tax liability would be incurred 
as part of our foreign subsidiary repatriation activities  we received cash dividends of million for  million for  and million for debt senior notes on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due senior notes at an issue price of 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the revolving credit facility or any of our other indebtedness 
we incurred financing costs in of approximately million related to the senior notes  which are being amortized over the term of the agreement 

table of contents the senior notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors future subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create or permit to exist liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur additional guarantees  and sell all or substantially all of our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the senior notes as of december  we intend to begin the process to register these securities with the sec during the first quarter of and will provide financial information regarding the guarantors of senior notes in accordance with securities regulations 
revolving credit facility on march   we entered into a new credit agreement credit agreement with a term of five years  which replaced our previous million revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement provides for a million  multicurrency revolving credit facility  with a million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings  a million sublimit for letters of credit  and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
the credit agreement includes an expansion feature  which allows us  subject to certain conditions  to request an increase to the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to million 
we paid financing costs in of approximately million related to this revolving credit facility and carried over deferred financing costs from our previous revolving credit facility of approximately million  resulting in total deferred financing costs of million  which we are amortizing over the term of the credit agreement 
we recognized expense of million related to the unamortized deferred financing costs on our previous revolving credit facility as part of the loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured and are fully guaranteed by newmarket and the subsidiary guarantors 
the revolving credit facility matures on march  borrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our election  either the alternate base rate abr plus the applicable rate solely in the case of loans denominated in us dollars to newmarket or the adjusted libo rate plus the applicable rate 
abr is the greatest of i the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period plus 
the adjusted libo rate means the rate at which eurocurrency deposits in the london interbank market for certain periods as selected by newmarket are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities and other applicable mandatory costs 
depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  the applicable rate ranges from to for loans bearing interest based on the abr and from to for loans bearing interest based on the adjusted libo rate 
at december   the applicable rate was for loans bearing interest based on the abr and for loans bearing interest based on the adjusted libo rate 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require newmarket to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of no more than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of no less than to  calculated on a rolling four quarter basis  as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending on and after march  at december   the leverage ratio was and the interest coverage ratio was 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facilities at december  and at december

senior notes on march   at our request  wells fargo bank  na  as trustee  issued a notice of redemption for all of our outstanding senior notes due  representing an aggregate principal amount of million 
under the indenture governing the senior notes  the redemption price was of the outstanding aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
subsequently  on april   all of the senior notes were redeemed 
we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the redemption 
we recognized total expenses of approximately million in related to the early redemption of the senior notes 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the senior notes as of december  foundry park i mortgage loan on may   we paid in full the outstanding principal amount on the mortgage loan 
no prepayment penalty was incurred 
we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance the payment 
concurrently with the payoff of the mortgage loan  the interest rate swap associated with the mortgage loan also terminated 
see note for information on the interest rate swap 
upon the payoff of the mortgage loan  we recognized expense of approximately million related to the unamortized financing costs on the mortgage loan 
other borrowings one of our subsidiaries in india has a short term line of credit of million rupees for working capital purposes 
the average interest rate was approximately during and during at december  the interest rate was 
the outstanding balance on the india line of credit of million million rupees at december  is due during another subsidiary in china has a short term line of credit of million with an outstanding balance of million at december  the average interest rate was approximately during and during at december  the interest rate was 
the outstanding balance on the china line of credit is due during we had combined current and noncurrent long term debt of million at december  and million at december  the increase in debt resulted from an increase in senior notes outstanding of million and additional borrowings of million on the revolving credit facility 
these amounts were partially offset by payoff of the mortgage loan of million and a reduction of million under short term lines of credit in china and india 
as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity  our total debt increased from at the end of to at the end of the change in the percentage was primarily the result of the increase in debt  as well as the decrease in shareholders equity 
the decrease in shareholders equity reflects the impact of dividend payments  including the per share special dividend  and the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss  partially offset by our earnings 
normally  we repay long term debt with cash from operations or refinancing activities 

table of contents working capital at december   we had working capital of million  resulting in a current ratio of to our working capital at december  was million resulting in a current ratio of to the change in the working capital ratio primarily reflects increased cash and cash equivalents  as well as higher accounts receivable and inventories  which was partially offset by lower prepaid expenses and other current assets  as well as higher accounts payable at december  the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects a income tax refund receivable  as well as higher sales levels when comparing fourth quarter and fourth quarter the fluctuation in inventories reflects higher quantities at certain locations in response to demand for our products  as well as normal fluctuations in sales patterns 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflects lower prepaid taxes on intercompany profit in inventory  the sale in of the innospec common stock which had been acquired as part of the innospec legal settlement  and the payment of the fourth quarter dividends in december  instead of in january the increase in accounts payable is from normal differences in timing of payments  as well as increased costs of raw materials 
capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million to million in we expect to continue to finance this capital spending through cash on hand and cash provided from operations  together with borrowing available under our million revolving credit facility 
the estimated capital expenditure amount includes anticipated spending in on a new manufacturing facility in singapore  as well as several improvements to our manufacturing and r d infrastructure around the world 
we expect capital expenditures to remain in the million to million range for each of the next three to five years in support of our worldwide business 
the singapore facility is expected to be operational in mid with a total investment of approximately million  with most of that occurring in the initial capacity will represent a modest increase in our overall global production  but will enable us to provide quick and effective service to our asia pacific customers  as well as those in india and the middle east 
the facility will be scalable to allow for growth  as demand warrants 
environmental expenses we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in for ongoing environmental operating and clean up costs  excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures 
these environmental operating and clean up expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
we expect to continue to fund these costs through cash provided by operations

amounts include environmental liabilities  including asset retirement obligations  as well as contributions associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans 
amounts accrued for the potential exposure with respect to litigation  claims  and assessments are not included in the table above 
pension and postretirement benefit plans our us and foreign benefit plans are discussed separately below 
our us pension and postretirement plans are similar and therefore  the information discussed below applies to all of our us benefit plans 
our foreign plans are quite diverse  and the actuarial assumptions used by the various foreign plans are based upon the circumstances of each particular country and retirement plan 
the discussion below surrounding our foreign retirement benefits focuses only on our pension plan in the united kingdom uk which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from foreign pension plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine our pension and postretirement expenses and related financial disclosure information 
additional information on our pension and postretirement plans is in note 
table of contents in july  the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map legislation was signed into law in the united states 
under prior regulations  defined benefit pension liabilities for minimum funding requirements were calculated by discounting projected future payments to present value using interest rates based on corporate bonds and average interest rates over the preceding two years 
the provisions of this law modify minimum funding rules to require that the discount rate used be within ten percent increasing to percent in and thereafter of the average of the corporate bond rates for the year period preceding the current year 
this provision will result in less fluctuation in interest rates from year to year and will reduce minimum funding requirements in the near term 
in addition  map also increased insurance premiums payable to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc  and allows for qualified transfers from overfunded defined benefit plans to retiree medical accounts and allows for the purchase of retiree group term life insurance 
we do not expect this law to have a material impact on the level of funding for our domestic defined benefit pension plans  nor do we expect the increase in pbgc premiums to be material 
further  we currently have no plans to make qualified transfers from any of our domestic defined benefit plans that would be allowed under map us pension and postretirement benefit plans the average remaining service period of active participants for our us plans is years  while the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants is years 
we utilize the optional combined mortality tables for males and females based on the rp mortality tables projected to with scale aa in determining the impact of the us benefit plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  we considered a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the us plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this analysis reflects our expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   the expected rates were for us large cap stocks  for fixed income  and for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
while the asset allocation for our us pension plans is predominantly weighted toward equities  through the ongoing monitoring of our investments and review of market data  we have decreased the expected long term rate of return for our us pension plans from to at december  an actuarial gain occurred during  as the actual investment return was higher than the expected return for all of our us pension plans by approximately million 
an actuarial loss occurred during  as the actual investment return was lower than the expected return for all of our us pension plans by approximately million 
during  the actual return was higher than the expected return  resulting in an actuarial gain for all of our us pension plans of approximately million 
investment gains and losses are recognized in earnings on an amortized basis over a period of years  but the gain will have no significant expense impact in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential long term benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
at december   our expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans was 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
pension expense and the life insurance portion of postretirement expense are sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption we develop the discount rate assumption by determining the single effective discount rate for a unique hypothetical portfolio constructed from investment grade bonds that  in aggregate  match the projected cash flows of each of our retirement plans 
the discount rate is developed based on the hypothetical portfolio on the last day of december 
the discount rate at december  was for all plans 

table of contents pension and postretirement benefit expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement benefit plans by approximately million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
rate of projected compensation increase we have maintained our rate of projected compensation increase at december  at 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates and investment gains or losses in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate cash contributions  before income taxes  to the us pension plans will be approximately million in we expect our contributions to the postretirement benefit plans will be approximately million in other assumptions we periodically review our assumption for the health care cost trend rate based on actual cost experience  typically assuming a higher current year trend scaling down to a lower permanent rate over a five to ten year period 
we refreshed this health care trend assumption for resulting in an assumed rate of for and for  scaling down to by foreign pension benefit plans our foreign pension plans are quite diverse 
the following information applies only to our uk pension plan  which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from our foreign pension plans 
the average remaining service period for our uk plan is years  while the average remaining life expectancy is years 
we utilize the s saps normal health light mortality tables and allow for future projected improvements in life expectancy in line with the cmi model  with a long term rate of improvement of per year based on the membership of the plan  in determining the impact of the uk pension plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on the uk pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return is based on both the asset allocation  as well as yields available in the uk markets 
the target asset allocation in the uk is to be invested in equities  in a mixture of government and corporate bonds  and in a pooled investment property fund  while the actual allocation at the end of was in equities  in government and corporate bonds  in a pooled investment property fund  and in cash 
based on the actual asset allocation and the expected yields available in the uk markets  the expected long term rate of return for the uk pension plan was at december  an actuarial gain occurred during as the actual investment return exceeded the expected return by approximately million 
in  the expected investment return exceeded the actual investment return by approximately million resulting in an actuarial loss for our uk pension plan 
an actuarial gain of million occurred in investment gains and losses are recognized in earnings on an amortized basis  resulting in decreased expense of approximately thousand in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for the target asset allocation 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plan by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption we utilize a yield curve based on aa rated corporate bond yields constructed from iboxx indices in developing a discount rate assumption extrapolated at longer terms based on the corresponding swap yield curve 
the yield appropriate to the duration of the uk plan liabilities is then used 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk 
table of contents pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have maintained our rate of projected compensation increase at december  at 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the uk pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate uk cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in other matters in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as well as a related reconciliation bill  was signed into law  which created a nationwide health insurance system 
in june  the united states supreme court substantially upheld the law 
the supreme court ruling had no impact on our results of operation  financial position  or cash flows 
see note outlook as we begin  we are confident that our customer focused approach to the market is the path on which to continue 
we believe the fundamentals of how we run our business a safety first culture  customer focused solutions  technology driven product offerings  world class supply chain capability  and a regional organizational structure to better understand our customers needs will continue to pay dividends to all of our stakeholders 
we have expectations that our petroleum additives segment will deliver improved results in  after having posted record operating profit for each of the last several years 
while our total shipments for contracted some due to many factors  including the global economy  we expect that petroleum additives shipment demand will continue to grow at an average annual rate of over the next five years  as there has been no significant change in the positive fundamentals of the business 
we plan to exceed the industry growth rate 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments to expand our capabilities around the world 
these investments have been in people  technology and technical centers  and production capacity 
we intend to use these new capabilities to improve our ability to deliver the goods and service that our customers value and to expand our business and improve profits 
we will continue to expand our capabilities to provide even better service  technology  and customer solutions 
as a global company operating in many countries around the world  we are not immune to world economic conditions 
western europe and the euro are significant factors in our business and financial results  as is the general economic activity around the world 
our expectations for include the assumption of modest economic recovery around the world 
at the end of  we secured year senior notes at a rate of 
this will provide long term debt capital to help us implement our strategic plan 
these bonds will cause us to have higher interest expense in  which will be an offset to some of the expected growth in our business 
our business continues to generate significant amounts of cash beyond what is necessary for the expansion and growth of our current product lines 
we regularly review the many internal opportunities which we have to utilize this cash  both from a geographic and product line perspective 
we continue our efforts in investigating potential acquisitions as both a use for this cash and to generate shareholder value 
our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
it is our view that this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on our investment while minimizing risk 
we remain focused on this strategy and will evaluate any future opportunities 
nonetheless  we are patient in this pursuit and intend to make the right acquisition when the opportunity arises 
we will continue to evaluate all alternative uses of that cash to enhance shareholder value  including stock repurchases and dividends 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in future reported financial results 
intangibles net of amortization and goodwill we have certain identifiable intangibles  as well as goodwill  amounting to million at december  that are discussed in note these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and  except for the goodwill  are being amortized over periods with up to approximately seventeen years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the values and amortization periods are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the values at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
in addition  our reporting unit with goodwill is not at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in the petroleum additives market  it could possibly cause a decrease in the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets or result in a noncash write off of all or a portion of the intangibles carrying amount 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no effect on cash flows 
we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions in the near term 
environmental and legal proceedings we have made disclosure of our environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  it is our opinion  based on our current knowledge  that we will not experience any material adverse effects on our results of operation  cash flows  or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement benefit plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could cause different results for the plans and therefore  impact our results of operation  cash flows  and financial condition 
we develop these assumptions after considering available information that we deem relevant 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item income taxes we file consolidated us federal and both consolidated and individual state income tax returns  as well as individual foreign income tax returns  under which assumptions may be made to determine the deductibility of certain costs 
we make estimates related to the impact of tax positions taken on our financial statements when we believe the tax position is likely to be upheld on audit 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in the determination of the estimated future recovery of deferred tax assets 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards for a full discussion of the more significant pronouncements which may impact our financial statements  see note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials 
these risk factors may affect our results of operation  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives and record them in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following analysis presents the effect on our results of operation  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at december  we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million 
of the total debt  million is at fixed rates 
there was no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt 
at december   we had million of outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility and million of outstanding variable rate debt under short term lines of credit 
holding all other variables constant  if the variable portion of the interest rates hypothetically increased  the effect on our earnings and cash flows would have been higher interest expense of approximately thousand 
we recorded the goldman sachs interest rate swap at fair value  which amounted to a liability of million at december  any change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical basis point adverse parallel shift in the libor yield curve would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the liability fair value of the interest rate swap with goldman sachs 
see note for further information 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt at december  foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 

table of contents raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  antioxidants  alcohols  solvents  sulfonates  friction modifiers  olefins and copolymers 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand  or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit
