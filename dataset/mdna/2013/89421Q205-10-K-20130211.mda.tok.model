we have two operating segments based on geographic regions north america and europe 
north america consists of our operations in canada and the us europe consists of our operations in france  germany  spain  and the uk for the year ended december   european operations were of revenues 
financial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

how we generate revenue our revenues are advertising revenues  consisting primarily of listing fees paid by travel  entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers on travelzoo s media properties 
listing fees are based on audience reach  placement  number of listings  number of impressions  number of clicks  number of referrals  or percentage of the face value of vouchers sold 
insertion orders are typically for periods between one month and twelve months and are not automatically renewed 
merchant agreements for local deals and getaway advertisers are typically for twelve months and are not automatically renewed 
we have three separate groups of our advertising products travel  search and local 
our travel category of revenue includes the publishing revenue for negotiated high quality deals from travel companies  such as hotels  airlines  cruises or car rentals and includes products such as top  website  newsflash  travelzoo network as well as getaway vouchers 
the revenues generated from these products are based upon a fee for number of e mails delivered to our audience  a fee for clicks delivered to the advertisers  a fee for placement of the advertising on our website or a fee based on a percentage of the face value of vouchers sold or other items sold 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of the e mails  delivery of the clicks  over the period of placement of the advertising and upon the sale of the vouchers or other items sold 
our search category of revenue includes comparison shopping tools for consumers to quickly and easily compare airfares  hotel and car rental prices and includes supersearch and fly 
com products 
the revenues generated from these products are based upon a fee for clicks delivered to the advertisers or a fee for clicks delivered to advertisers that resulted in revenue for advertisers ie successful clicks 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of the clicks or successful clicks 
our local category of revenue includes the publishing revenue for negotiated high quality deals from local businesses  such as restaurants  spas  shows  and other activities and includes local deals vouchers and entertainment offers vouchers and direct bookings 
the revenues generated from these products are based upon a percentage of the face value of vouchers or items sold or a fee for clicks delivered to the advertisers 
we recognize revenue upon the sale of the vouchers  when we receive notification of the direct bookings or upon delivery of the clicks 
the company earns a fee for acting as an agent in these transactions  which is recorded on a net basis and is included in revenue upon completion of the voucher sale 
certain merchant contracts in foreign locations allow us to retain fees related to vouchers sold that are not redeemed by purchasers upon expiration  which we recognize as revenue after the expiration of the redemption period and after there are no further obligations to provide funds to merchants  subscribers or others 
trends in our business our ability to generate revenues in the future depends on numerous factors such as our ability to sell more advertising to existing and new advertisers  our ability to increase our audience reach and advertising rates and our ability to develop and launch new products 
our current revenue model depends on advertising fees paid primarily by travel  entertainment and local businesses 
a number of factors can influence whether current and new advertisers decide to advertise their offers with us 
we have been impacted and expect to continue to be impacted by external factors such as the shift from offline to online advertising  the relative health of the economy  competition and the introduction of new methods of advertising 
for example  the consolidation of the airline industry reduced our revenues generated from this sector  the reduction of capacity in the airline industry reduced demand to advertise for excess capacity  the introduction of new voucher based products offered by competitive companies impacted our ability to sell our existing advertising products  the reduction in spending by travel intermediaries due to their focus on improving profitability  the trend towards mobile usage by consumers  the willingness of consumers to purchase the deals we advertise  the willingness of certain competitors to grow their business unprofitably and the economic uncertainty in europe impacted advertiser s willingness to purchase our advertising 
in addition  we have been impacted and expect to continue to be impacted by internal factors such as introduction of new advertising products  hiring and relying on key employees for the continued maintenance and growth of our business and ensuring our advertising products continue to attract the audience that advertisers desire 
existing advertisers may shift from one advertising service eg top to another eg local deals and getaway 
these shifts between advertising services by advertisers could result in no incremental revenue or less revenue than in previous periods depending on the amount purchased by the advertisers  and in particular  with local deals and getaway  depending on how many vouchers are purchased by subscribers 
since the introduction of local deals in and getaway in  we have seen a decline in the number of average vouchers sold per deal 
our ability to continue to generate advertising revenue depends heavily upon our ability to maintain and grow an attractive audience to reach with our advertising publications 
we monitor our subscribers and page views of our websites to assess our efforts to maintain and grow our audience reach 
we obtain additional subscribers and activity on our websites by acquiring traffic from internet search companies 
the costs to grow our audience have had  and we expect will continue to have  a significant impact on our financial results and can vary from period to period 
we may have to increase our expenditures on acquiring traffic to continue to grow or maintain our reach of our publications due to competition 
we believe that we can increase our advertising rates only if the reach of our publications increases 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the reach of our publications 
if we are able to increase the reach of our publications  we still may not be able to or want to increase rates given market conditions such as intense competition in our industry 
we have not had any significant rate increase in recent years due to intense competition in our industry 
even if we increase our rates  based upon the increased price this may reduce the amount of advertisers willing to advertise for the increased rates and therefore decrease our revenue 
we do not know what our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be in future periods 
our cost of revenues will increase if the number of searches performed on fly 
com increases because we pay a fee based on the number of searches performed on fly 
com 
our cost of revenues will increase if the face value of vouchers that we sell for local deals and getaway increases or the total number of vouchers sold increases because we have credit card fees based upon face value of vouchers sold  customer service costs related to vouchers sold and subscriber refunds on vouchers sold 
we expect fluctuations of cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
we do not know what our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods 
increased competition in our industry may require us to increase advertising for our brand and for our products 
in order to increase the reach of our publications  we have to acquire a significant number of new subscribers in every quarter and continue to promote our brand 
one significant factor that impacts our advertising expenses is the average cost per acquisition of a new subscriber 
increases in the average cost of acquiring new subscribers may result in an increase of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
we believe that the average cost per acquisition depends mainly on the advertising rates which we pay for media buys  our ability to manage our subscriber acquisition efforts successfully  and the degree of competition in our industry 
we may decide to accelerate our subscriber acquisition for various strategic and tactical reasons and  as a result  increase our marketing expenses 
we may see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign that will result in an increase of marketing expenses 
further  we expect our strategy to replicate our business model in selected foreign markets to result in a significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
due to the continued desire to grow our business both in the north america and europe we expect relatively high level of sales and marketing expenses in the foreseeable future 
we expect fluctuations of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
we expect increased marketing expense to spur continued growth in subscribers and revenue in future periods  however  we cannot be assured of this due to the many factors that impact our growth in subscribers and revenue 
we expect to adjust the level of such incremental spending during any given quarter based upon market conditions as well as our performance in each quarter 
we do not know what our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods 
there may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations 
we expect our headcount to continue to increase in the future 
the company s headcount is one of the main drivers of general and administrative expenses 
therefore  we expect our absolute general and administrative expenses to continue to increase 
we expect our continued expansion into foreign markets and development of new advertising formats to result in a significant additional increase in our general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may also fluctuate depending on the number of requests received related to a program under which the company intends to make cash payments to people who establish that they were former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation  and who failed to submit requests to convert shares into travelzoo inc within the required time period 
we expect an increase in legal and professional fees due primarily to our defense of legal proceedings and claims and compliance efforts 
in addition  we expect to incur additional costs related to the development of our hotel booking platform capabilities 
we do not know what our income taxes will be in future periods 
there may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations 
our income taxes are dependent on numerous factors such as the geographic mix of our taxable income  federal and state and foreign country tax law and regulations and changes thereto  the amount of accumulated net operating loss we have to offset current taxable income  the determination of whether valuation allowances for certain tax assets are required or not  including our valuation allowance on our european loss carryforwards  audits of prior years tax returns resulting in adjustments  resolution of uncertain tax positions and different treatment for certain items for tax versus books such as the disposition of our asia business in or our state of delaware settlement during we expect fluctuations in our income taxes from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations 
the key elements of our growth strategy include building strong brand awareness  increasing reach  maintaining a high quality user base  increasing the number of advertisers  providing advertisers with excellent service and replicating our business model in foreign markets  as well as developing new products that keep pace with changes in consumer preferences and technology  such as the trend toward mobile usage by consumers 
we expect to continue our efforts to grow  however  we may not grow or we may experience slower growth 
some examples of our efforts to expand our business internationally since our inception from the us have been expansion to the us in  canada in  germany in  france in and spain in we also have launched new products to grow our revenue such as the introduction of fly 
com in  local deals in  getaway in as well as our mobile application launches in and we bought an online hotel booking platform to serve hotels and to facilitate a hotel commission based offering 
we believe that we can sell more advertising only if the market for online advertising continues to grow and if we can maintain or increase our market share 
we believe that the market for advertising continues to shift from offline to online 
we do not know if we will be able to maintain or increase our market share 
we do not know if we will be able to increase the number of advertisers in the future 
we do not know if we will have market acceptance of our new products or whether the market will continue to accept our existing products

unexchanged promotional merger shares on april   the company entered into an agreement with the state of delaware resolving all claims relating to a previously announced unclaimed property review 
the primary issue raised in the preliminary findings from the review  received by the company on april   concerned the shares of travelzoo which have not been claimed by former shareholders of travelzoo 
com corporation following a merger  as previously disclosed in the company s report on form k 
in the preliminary findings under the unclaimed property review  up to million shares were identified as demandable under delaware escheat laws 
while the company continues to take the position that such shares were a promotional incentive and were issuable only to persons who establish their eligibility as shareholders  the company determined that it was in its best interest to promptly resolve all claims relating to the unclaimed property review 
under the terms of the agreement  the company made a million cash payment to the state of delaware on april  and received a complete release of those claims 
the million payment was recorded as an expense in the three months ended march  since march  the company has become subject to unclaimed property reviews by most of the other states in the us that relate primarily to the unexchanged promotional merger shares  which were not covered by the settlement and release by the state of delaware 
during the three months ended march   the company recorded a million charge related to this unexchanged promotional merger shares contingency 
while the company believes it has meritorious defenses regarding the applicability of escheat rights related to this unexchanged promotional merger shares contingency  the ultimate resolution of this matter may take longer than one year 
if the claims for all of the additional shares referred to in the preliminary findings were upheld in full  based on the closing price of the company s shares at the end of december   the cost to the company would be approximately million in excess of the amount accrued  plus any interest or penalties  which might be applicable 
in addition  the total amount of exposure of this contingency is dependent upon the manner in which each state applies its unclaimed property laws 
the company is not able to predict the ultimate amount or outcome of any current or future claims which have been or might be asserted relating to the unissued shares 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the unexchanged promotional merger shares contingency

income taxes our income is generally taxed in the us and canada and our income tax provision reflect federal  state and country statutory rates applicable to our levels of income  adjusted to take into account expenses that are treated as having no recognizable tax benefit 
income tax expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased in compared to due primarily to the million expense for the settlement with the state of delaware that was treated as having no recognizable tax benefits in the year ended december  in the year ended december   the million accrued expense for unexchanged promotional merger shares was treated as having no recognizable tax benefit 
we expect that our effective tax rate in future periods may fluctuate depending on the geographic mix of our worldwide taxable income  total amount of expenses representing payments to former stockholders  losses or gains incurred by our operations in canada and europe  the use of accumulated losses to offset current taxable income and need for valuation allowances on certain tax assets  if any 
the company has a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized 
these net operating loss carryforwards do not expire 
at december   the company determined that approximately  of the total foreign net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in future periods 
therefore  the company recognized  of deferred tax assets associated with the foreign net operating loss carryforwards  as a reduction in the valuation allowance at december  united states income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries 
the undistributed earnings on a book basis for the non us subsidiaries are approximately million 
the company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in its operations outside the us if the undistributed earnings are remitted to the us these amounts would be taxable in the u 
s at the current federal and state tax rates net of foreign tax credits 
also  depending on the jurisdiction any distribution may be subject to withholding taxes at rates applicable for that jurisdiction 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we are subject to us federal and certain state tax examinations for years after and are subject to california tax examinations for years after we are under examination by federal and state taxing authorities 
we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations  although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations 
due to the ongoing tax examinations  we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments

while future payments for this program are expected to decrease  the total cost of this program is still undeterminable because it is dependent on our stock price and on the number of valid requests ultimately received 
in addition  we do not know if the current unclaimed property audits that are focused on the unexchanged promotional merger shares will result in additional payments to states or former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation 
consistent with our growth  we have experienced substantial increases in our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses and our general and administrative expenses  including increases in product development costs  and we anticipate that these increases will continue for the foreseeable future 
we believe cash on hand will be sufficient to pay such costs for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies  the consummation of any of which would increase our capital requirements 
although we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months  unanticipated events and opportunities or a less favorable than expected development of our business in europe with one or more of advertising formats may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new credit facilities to raise capital in order to meet our capital requirements 
if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  the sale could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
if we issue debt securities or establish a new credit facility  our fixed obligations could increase  and we may be required to agree to operating covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot be sure that any such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if the development of our business is less favorable than expected  we may decide to significantly reduce the size of our operations and marketing expenses in certain markets with the objective of reducing cash outflow 
the information set forth under note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report is incorporated herein by reference 
litigation and claims against the company may result in legal defense costs  settlements or judgments that could have a material impact on our financial condition 
the following summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  in thousands thereafter total operating leases purchase obligations total commitments we also have contingencies related to net unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million as of december  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates on the timing of the cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  reserve for subscriber refunds  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax and loss contingencies 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin for revenue recognition 
we recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
effective january   we adopted asu the adoption of this new accounting standard had no material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
if fixed fee advertising is displayed over a term greater than one month  revenues are recognized ratably over the period as described below 
the majority of insertion orders have terms that begin and end in a quarterly reporting period 
in the cases where at the end of a quarterly reporting period the term of an insertion order is not complete  the company allocates the total arrangement fee to each element based on the relative estimated selling price of each element 
the company uses prices stated on its internal rate card  which represents stand alone sales prices  to establish estimated selling prices 
the stand alone price is the price that would be charged if the advertiser purchased only the individual insertion 
fees for variable fee advertising arrangements are recognized based on the number of impressions displayed  number of clicks delivered  or number of referrals generated during the period 
under these policies  no revenue is recognized unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed reasonably assured 
the company evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider an insertion order signed by the advertiser or its agency to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when the advertising has been displayed and  if applicable  the click throughs have been delivered 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are standard 
collection is deemed reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review for all transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the advertiser 
collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect that the advertiser will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
collection is deemed not reasonably assured when an advertiser is perceived to be in financial distress  which may be evidenced by weak industry conditions  a bankruptcy filing  or previously billed amounts that are past due 
revenues from advertising sold to advertisers through agencies are reported at the net amount billed to the agency 
the company started selling vouchers for local deals in third quarter and getaway in second quarter  from local businesses such as spas  hotels and restaurants 
the company earns a fee for acting as an agent in these transactions which is recorded on a net basis and is included in revenue upon completion of the voucher sale 
certain merchant contracts in foreign locations allow us to retain fees related to vouchers sold that are not redeemed by purchasers upon expiration  which we recognize as revenue after the expiration of the redemption period and after there are no further obligations to provide funds to merchants  subscribers or others 
reserve for subscriber refunds we record an estimated reserve for subscriber refunds based on our historical experience at the time revenue is recorded for local deals and getaway voucher sales 
we accrue costs associated with refunds in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
we consider many key factors such as the historical refunds based upon the time lag since the sale  historical reasons for refunds  time period that remains until the deal expiration date  any changes in refund procedures and estimates of redemptions and breakage 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future reserves for subscriber refunds 
specifically  if the financial condition of our advertisers  the business that is providing the vouchered service  were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to provide the services to our subscribers  additional reserves for subscriber refunds may be required 
estimated subscriber refunds that are determined to be recoverable from the merchant are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to revenue 
estimated subscriber refunds that are determined not to be recoverable from the merchant are presented as a cost of revenue 
if our judgments regarding estimated subscriber refunds are inaccurate  reported results of operations could differ from the amount we previously accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the creditworthiness of the advertiser  the economic conditions of the advertiser s industry  and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations  state taxes  certain benefits realized related to stock option activities  research and experimentation tax credits  the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us and tax asset valuation allowance determinations  including on certain loss carryforwards 
for the years ended december  and  our effective tax rates were and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be materially impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  changes in the deferred tax assets or liabilities  changes in tax asset valuation allowance determinations including our valuation allowance on our european loss carryforwards  changes in our judgment about whether certain foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us  or changes in tax laws  regulations  and accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
loss contingencies we are involved in claims  suits  and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business 
we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred  and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount 
such claim proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  it could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we have several known loss contingencies such as our liability to former stockholders of travelzoo 
com corporation that may be realized as a result of our cash program for these claimants  state unclaimed property claims or otherwise and several lawsuits  both class actions and derivative lawsuits  as well as a patent infringement lawsuit 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further details about our loss contingencies 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our potential exposure to changes in market interest rates is not material 
the company has no outstanding debt and is not a party to any derivative transactions 
we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments 
our operations in canada expose us to foreign currency risk associated with agreements being denominated in canadian dollars 
our operations in europe expose us to foreign currency risk associated with agreements being denominated in british pound sterling and euros 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations of these currencies as the financial position and operating results of our operations in canada and europe are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 
we are a net receiver of us dollars from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency used by the foreign subsidiary as its functional currency 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in an incremental  foreign exchange loss for the year ended december
