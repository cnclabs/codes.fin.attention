overview throughout  we continued our developmental drilling in two primary oil prone regions  the permian basin and giddings area  where we have a significant inventory of developmental drilling opportunities 
we currently have two of our drilling rigs working in reeves county  texas drilling wolfbone wells 
we spent approximately million in the wolfbone area in reeves county in on drilling  completion and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately million in this area in we currently have one of our drilling rigs working in andrews county  texas drilling wolfberry wells 
we spent approximately million related primarily to drilling and completing wolfberry wells in andrews county in and currently plan to spend approximately million in this area in we are continuing to exploit our extensive acreage position in the giddings area of east central texas 
while most of our drilling activities have been directed toward infill drilling of horizontal wells in the austin chalk formation  this area is also known for its reserve potential from other formations such as the eagle ford shale  buda  georgetown  cotton valley  deep bossier and taylor formations 
in  we spent approximately million on austin chalk eagle ford shale drilling and leasing activities 
since july  we have drilled six horizontal eagle ford shale wells the hosek unit  the ortmann unit and the kutac unit in wilson county  the balcar unit in lee county  the scasta unit in brazos county and the sarah ferrara e unit in robertson county 
we are currently working one of our drilling rigs in this area to drill horizontal wells in the eagle ford shale and currently plan to spend approximately million on drilling and completion costs and million on leasing activities in over the past two years  we have invested more than million in the permian basin and the giddings area 
we outspent our cash flow by approximately million  and increased our total debt by million from december  to december  during  we plan to take steps to reduce debt and achieve a sustainable balance between future capital expenditures and capital resources by reducing capital spending from million in to million in  offering our andrews county wolfberry assets for sale and seeking a joint venture partner in reeves county 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for our oil and gas sales  excluding amortized deferred revenues  decreased million  or  from price variances accounted for a decrease of million and production variances accounted for a million increase 
oil and gas sales in also includes million of amortized deferred revenue attributable to the vpp granted effective march  to finance the merger consideration payable in connection with the mergers of each of limited partnerships of which swr was the general partner into swr swr mergers 
our oil production increased compared to while gas production declined 
our combined oil and gas production for increased on a boe basis compared to the increase in oil production and the decline in gas production are indicative of our current emphasis on the development of oil reserves in the permian basin 

table of contents production costs increased from million in to million in due to a combination of an increase in the number of producing wells  higher costs of field services  including salt water disposal costs  and higher property taxes on texas properties resulting from rising appraisal values 
we recorded a million net gain on derivatives in  consisting of a million non cash unrealized gain for changes in mark to market valuations and a million realized loss on settled contracts 
for fiscal  we recorded a million net gain on derivatives  consisting of a million non cash unrealized gain for changes in mark to market valuations and a million realized gain on settled contracts 
cash settlements in included million from the early termination of contracts covering oil production for and since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased to million in versus million in due primarily to a increase in the average depletion rate per boe of production 
most of the increase in depletion rate related to downward revisions in proved reserves in the company andrews county wolfberry play 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due primarily to the increase in our revolving credit facility from an average daily principal balance of million in to million in general and administrative g a expenses for were million compared to million in non cash employee compensation from incentive compensation plans accounted for a credit to expense of  in versus million expense in g a expenses  excluding non cash employee compensation expense  increased to million in versus million in the period included million of non recurring donations to charitable and organizations 
our estimated proved oil and gas reserves at december  increased to  mboe from  mboe at december  we replaced of our oil and gas production in through extensions and discoveries of  mboe  had purchases of minerals in place of  mboe  had downward net revisions of  mboe  and had sales of minerals in place of mboe see part i item properties reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves the following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during proved reserves mboe as of december  extensions and discoveries purchases of minerals in place revisions sales of minerals in place production as of december  extensions and discoveries 
extensions and discoveries in added  mboe of proved reserves  replacing of our production 
these additions resulted primarily from our reeves county and andrews county drilling programs in the permian basin 
of the total reserve additions  proved developed reserves accounted for  mboe  while the remaining  mboe were proved undeveloped reserves 
purchases of minerals in place 
in march  we added  mboe of proved reserves with the completion of the swr mergers 
revisions 
net downward revisions of  mboe consisted of downward revisions of  mboe related to performance and downward revisions of  mboe related to pricing 
downward price revisions of  mboe were 
table of contents attributable to the effects of lower product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves 
substantially all of the downward performance revisions were attributable to the company andrews county wolfberry drilling program 
sales of minerals in place 
in march  swr entered into a vpp with a third party and conveyed a term overriding royalty interest covering mboe of estimated future oil and gas production from certain properties to obtain funds to finance the swr mergers 
the following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during proved undeveloped reserves mboe as of december  extensions and discoveries purchases of minerals in place revisions reclassified to proved developed as of december  we added  mboe of proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries related to permian basin and giddings area drilling locations  including  mboe of upgrades from probable to proved undeveloped 
we had purchases of minerals in place of  mboe in connection with the completion of the swr mergers 
downward revisions of  mboe resulted primarily from performance revisions of  mboe and pricing revisions of  mboe 
we also converted  mboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december  to proved developed reserves during at a cost of approximately million 
we expect to develop approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves in at a cost of approximately million

historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased to million in as compared to million in the increase in production costs was due to a combination of an increase in the number of producing wells  higher costs of field services  including salt water disposal costs  and higher property taxes on texas properties resulting from rising appraisal values 
oil and gas depletion expense increased million from to due to a million increase related to rate variances and a million increase due to production variances

liquidity and capital resources our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na to secure our revolving credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base  in part  by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on our revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
however  we may mitigate the effects of product prices on cash flow through the use of commodity derivatives 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  leaving million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
this level of liquidity does not permit us to continue capital spending at the same level as we experienced in as a result  during  we plan to take steps to reduce debt and increase liquidity through a combination of lower capital spending and sales of certain producing properties to achieve what we believe is a sustainable balance between our future capital commitments and our expected financial resources 
actions that we expect to take during include the following reduce capital spending we currently plan to reduce capital spending in to a level that is more closely aligned with our expected cash flow from operations 
we are currently running four rigs  rigs drilling vertical and horizontal wells in the delaware basin wolfbone play  one rig drilling vertical wolfberry wells in andrews county  and one rig drilling horizontal eagle ford shale wells in our giddings area 
at this level of drilling activity  we expect to reduce our capital spending related to exploration and development activities by approximately to million and hold our additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to less than million in as compared to million of borrowings in sell wolfberry assets we are offering for sale our andrews county wolfberry assets and have retained an advisor to assist with this transaction 
if acceptable terms of sale are achieved through this process  we anticipate closing the transaction during the second quarter of joint venture reeves county wolfbone assets we plan to seek a joint venture partner for a portion of our net interest in reeves county wolfbone assets through a joint venture arrangement in which we would expect to receive a combination of an upfront cash payment and a drilling carry 
if acceptable terms to a joint venture arrangement are achieved  we anticipate closing the transaction during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents reduce bank debt we plan to use all cash proceeds from asset sales to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
although most of our wolfberry and wolfbone assets are pledged to secure borrowings on our revolving credit facility  we expect to receive cash proceeds in excess of the loan value assigned to the sold assets  thereby providing us with additional liquidity under the credit facility 
balance future drilling commitments throughout the year  we will also consider other asset sales and or monetization transactions that enhance shareholder value and meet strategic operating and financial objectives  including the possible sale of our east permian basin cline shale wolfberry assets in glasscock and sterling counties 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes  by area  our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during  as compared to our actual expenditures in actual expenditures year ended december  planned expenditures year ending december  percentage of total in thousands drilling and completion permian basin area delaware basin other austin chalk eagle ford shale other leasing and seismic exploration and development our expenditures for exploration and development activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
we financed these expenditures in with cash flow from operating activities and million of advances under our revolving credit facility 
we currently plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities during fiscal our actual expenditures during may vary significantly from these estimates if our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year 
factors  such as drilling results  changes in operating margins  and the availability of capital resources and other factors  could increase or decrease our ultimate level of expenditures during based on preliminary estimates  our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flow  combined with funds available to us on our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our planned exploration and development activities through although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  these forecasts are inherently uncertain and the borrowing base may be less than expected  cash flow may be less than expected  or capital expenditures may be more than expected 
in the event we lack adequate liquidity to finance our expenditures through  we will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources  including selling assets or accessing capital markets 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million  or  as compared to the corresponding period in due primarily to lower commodity prices and a increase in production costs 

table of contents revolving credit facility we have a credit facility with a syndicate of banks that provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million  limited to the amount of a borrowing base as determined by the banks 
we have historically relied on our revolving credit facility for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financial needs 
as long as we have sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our obligations as they become due  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
the borrowing base  which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production  is redetermined by the banks semi annually in may and november 
we or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year 
if  at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under our revolving credit facility  we will be required to provide additional security  prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency or by a combination of such additional security and such prepayment to eliminate such deficiency  or prepay the deficiency in not more than five equal monthly installments plus accrued interest 
in may  the banks increased the borrowing base from million to million and then to million in november the banks also increased the aggregate commitment from million to million in april  to million in august and then to million in november we may request an increase in the aggregate commitment up to the borrowing base at any time  however  each bank must consent to its allocable portion of such increase 
at our election  annual interest rates under our revolving credit facility are determined by reference to libor plus an applicable margin between and per year or if an alternate base rate loan  the greatest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  or c one month libor plus plus  if any of a  b or c  an applicable margin between and per year 
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility at a rate between and 
the applicable margins are based on actual borrowings outstanding as a percentage of the borrowing base 
interest and fees are payable no less often than quarterly 
the effective annual interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility  excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs  for the year ended december  was 
our revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may  among other things  limit our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
one such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities consolidated current ratio of at least to in computing the consolidated current ratio at any balance sheet date  we must include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives non cash assets or liabilities  and exclude current assets and liabilities attributable to vendor financing transactions  if any 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under our revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our gaap reported working capital deficit decreased from million at december  to working capital of million at december  after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was million at december   as compared to million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital deficit to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under our revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities working capital per loan covenant our revolving credit facility provides that the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitdax the leverage ratio determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters from being greater than to 
table of contents we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december  however  if we increase leverage and our liquidity is reduced  we may fail to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to waive compliance  amend our revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
the lending group under our revolving credit facility includes the following institutions jpmorgan chase bank  na  union bank  na  wells fargo bank  na  the royal bank of scotland plc  compass bank  frost bank  natixis  keybank  na  ubs loan finance  llc  fifth third bank  us bank  na  and whitney bank 
from time to time  we engage in other transactions with lenders under our revolving credit facility 
such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements 
as of december   jpmorgan chase bank  na was the only counterparty to our commodity derivative agreements 
our obligations under existing derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under our revolving credit facility 
during  we increased indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility by million 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  leaving million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
our revolving credit facility matures in november senior notes in july  we issued million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and bore interest at per year  payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning february  in march  we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a tender offer and recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of long term debt  consisting of a million premium and a million write off of debt issuance costs 
on august   we called at par and redeemed in full the remaining million of senior notes and recorded an additional  loss on early extinguishment of long term debt related to the write off of debt issuance costs 
in march  we issued million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning october  in april  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an original issue discount of or  we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to beginning on april   beginning on april   and beginning on april  or for any period thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to borrow money  issue redeemable or preferred stock  pay distributions or dividends  make investments  create liens without securing the senior notes  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  guarantee indebtedness  and enter into new lines of business 
one such covenant provides that we may only incur indebtedness if the ratio of consolidated ebitdax to consolidated interest expense as these terms are defined in the indenture does not exceed certain ratios specified in the indenture 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  alternative capital resources if we are unable to reduce debt and balance our future capital expenditures with capital resources through our current plan to reduce capital spending  sell our andrews county wolfberry assets and find a joint venture partner for our wolfbone play in reeves county  we may seek to obtain additional capital from alternative sources 
we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  obtain capital through other sources  such as issuances of subordinated debt in public or private placements  sales or monetization of certain of our other non core assets  or vendor financing arrangements 
we could also issue common stock or preferred stock in public or private placements if we choose to seek funds through the equity markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us

c amount relates to non cancellable orders placed for tubular goods at december  off balance sheet arrangements currently  we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
known trends and uncertainties operating margins we analyze  on a boe produced basis  those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas operating margins 
our weighted average oil and gas sales per boe have fluctuated from per boe in  to per boe in and to per boe in our expenses per boe were on an upward trend through resulting in our operating margins being less favorable in our oil and gas dd a per boe was per boe in  per boe in and per boe in an upward trend in dd a per boe indicates that our cost to find and or acquire reserves is increasing at a faster rate than the reserves we are adding 
although we replaced of our production in  commodity prices were lower and our costs to find those reserves were significantly higher than our historical combined rate 
also affecting our operating margins is the cost of producing our reserves 
our production costs per boe have increased from per boe in  to per boe in  to per boe in the increase in operating costs per boe in was due a combination of an increase in the number of producing wells  higher costs of field services  including salt water disposal costs  and higher property taxes on texas properties resulting from rising appraisal values 
oil and gas production as with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  we face the challenge of natural production decline because oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource 
with each unit of oil and gas we produce  we are depleting our proved reserve base  so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base 
although our production remained relatively constant in over levels  our production in increased to mmboe compared to mmboe in  and we replaced of our oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries 
while these reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in  we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our existing base of oil and gas reserves 
we currently plan to decrease capital spending during to million on exploration and development activities compared to million in a decrease in spending levels will make it more difficult for us to grow our production and

failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected successful efforts accounting for oil and gas properties reserve estimates valuation of unproved properties judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells oil and gas properties accumulated dd a provision for dd a impairment of unproved properties abandonment costs dry hole costs impairment of proved properties and long lived assets reserve estimates and related present value of future net revenues proved properties estimates of future undiscounted cash flows long lived assets oil and gas properties contract drilling equipment accumulated dd a impairment of proved properties and long lived assets asset retirement obligations estimates of the present value of future abandonment costs asset retirement obligations non current liability oil and gas properties accretion of discount expense inventory stated at the lower of average cost or estimated market value estimates of market value of tubular goods and other well equipment impairment of inventory derivatives mark to market estimates of the fair value of derivatives fair value of derivatives other income expense gain loss on derivatives significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of and the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 

table of contents the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of precision proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least precise proved developed non producing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more precise proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most precise assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
current sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the month period preceding the effective date of the reserve report 
varying pricing can result in significant changes in reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from period to period  as illustrated in the following table 
proved reserves average price standardized measure of discounted future oil natural gas liquids gas oil natural gas liquids gas mmbbls mmbbls bcf bbl bbl mcf net cash flows in millions as of december valuation of unproved properties estimating fair market value of unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
asset retirement obligations we estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we compute our liability for asset retirement obligations by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property 
this requires us to use significant 
table of contents assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements gaap does not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional data 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available data or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate x current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties and long lived assets each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with gaap  the value for this purpose is a fair value using level inputs instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated fair value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the fair value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated fair value 
if the fair value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments 
table of contents expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
during  we had an upward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations of million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to dd a expense and accretion expense 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu will require entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
application of the asu is required for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
at that time we will make the necessary disclosures 
the adoption of asu will not impact the company s future financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market commodity prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas commodity prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to commodity price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas commodity prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per bbl of oil and a decline in the price per mcf of gas from year end would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a combination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from 
table of contents either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december  the settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on nymex futures prices 
swaps oil gas bbls price mmbtu a price production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives 
a per barrel change in the price of oil and a per mmbtu change in the price of gas would change the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  by approximately million 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on our long term debt with a variable interest rate 
at december   our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million  based on current market quotes 
we estimate that the hypothetical change in the fair value of our long term debt resulting from a basis point change in interest rates would be approximately million 
based on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness at december  of million  a change in interest rates of basis points would affect annual interest payments by million
