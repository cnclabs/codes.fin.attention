we deliver our suite over the internet as a saas model 
in  we released our first application  netledger  which focused on accounting applications 
we then released ecommerce functionality in and crm and sales force automation functionality in in  we released our next generation suite under the name netsuite to which we have regularly added features and functionality 
in december  we went public 
in  we acquired openair  and in we acquired quickarrow inc qa  both of which offer professional services automation and project portfolio management products 
our headquarters are located in san mateo  california 
we were incorporated in california in september and reincorporated in delaware in november we conduct our business worldwide  with international locations in canada  europe  asia  australia and uruguay 
during  we acquired the following two companies to further develop our ecommerce vertical 
in connection with these acquisitions  we incurred transaction costs totaling million 
in november  we purchased certain assets from retail anywhere ra  an on line retail solution service provider 
we purchased ra to expand our retail software solutions in our ecommerce vertical 
ra software allows us to expand our ecommerce services to brick and mortar store point of sale terminals 
the ra assets and operating results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
on the closing date  we paid million in cash 
additional consideration of million in cash is being withheld for up to the next months following the close of the transaction as protection against certain losses that we may incur in the event of certain breaches of representations and warranties covered in the purchase agreement 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we completed the purchase of all of the outstanding equity of two small south american companies sac that specialize in ecommerce technology and services 
we also purchased certain assets from two entities related to the sac 
the sac workforce will augment our existing professional services and product development teams 
on the closing dates  we paid million in cash 
additional consideration of million in cash is being withheld for various periods up to the next years following the close of the transaction as protection against certain losses we may incur in the event of certain breaches of representations and warranties covered in the purchase agreement 
during the second quarter of  we recorded  in operating expenses related to transaction costs associated with this business combination 
key components of our results of operations revenue our revenue has grown from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  we generate sales directly through our sales team and  to a lesser extent  indirectly through channel partners 
we sell our service to customers across a broad spectrum of industries  and we have tailored our service for wholesalers distributors  manufacturers  e tailers  services companies and software companies 
the primary target customers for our service are medium sized businesses and divisions of large companies 
an increasing percentage of our customers and our revenue have been derived from larger businesses within this market 
for the year ended december   we did not have any single customer that accounted for more than of our revenue 
we are pursuing a number of strategies that we believe will enable us to continue to grow 
the goals of those strategic objectives are to continue to move up market  to increase the use of netsuite as a platform  and to extend the verticalization of our product line 
although we have made progress toward our goals in recent periods  there are still many areas where we believe that we can continue to grow 
to achieve these goals  we are focused on the following initiatives growth of sales of oneworld  our platform for erp  crm  psa and ecommerce capabilities in multi currency environments across multiple subsidiaries and legal entities  which supports the needs of large  standalone companies  and divisions of large enterprises  strengthening our offerings for targeted industries such as wholesale distribution  manufacturing  e tail  retail  technology and professional services by adding deeper verticalized functionality  and developing our suitecloud ecosystem to enable third parties to extend our offerings with their vertical expertise or horizontal solution 
we experience competitive pricing pressure when our products are compared with solutions that address a narrower range of customer needs or are not fully integrated for example  when compared with ecommerce or crm stand alone solutions 
in addition  since we sell primarily to medium sized businesses  we also face pricing pressure in terms of the more limited financial resources or budgetary constraints of many of our target customers 
we do not currently experience significant pricing pressure from competitors that offer a similar cloud based integrated business management suite 
we sell our application suite pursuant to subscription agreements 
the duration of these agreements is generally one to three years 
we rely in part on a large percentage of our customers to renew their agreements to drive our revenue growth 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription period 
we generally invoice our customers in advance in monthly  annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our clients pay us within to days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced where the customer has a legal obligation to pay are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
as of december   we had deferred revenue of million 
backlog was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
of the million in backlog as of december   million was short term backlog and million was long term backlog 
the million in backlog as of december  included million in short term backlog and million in long term backlog 
backlog represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced or have not been recorded as deferred revenue 
we expect that the amount of backlog may change from year to year for several reasons  including specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements  varying billing cycles of non cancelable subscription agreements  the specific timing of customer renewals  foreign currency fluctuations  the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue and changes in customer financial circumstances 
for multi year subscription agreements billed annually  the associated backlog is typically high at the beginning of the contract period  zero immediately prior to expiration and increases if the agreement is renewed 
low backlog attributable to a particular subscription agreement is typically associated with an impending renewal and is not an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue of that customer 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of backlog may change from year to year depending in part 
table of contents upon the number of subscription agreements in particular stages in their renewal cycle 
such fluctuations are not reliable indicators of future revenues 
during the second quarter of  we updated the terms of our standard renewal agreement form so that the legal obligation to pay by our customers occurs upon execution of the renewal agreement rather than on their renewal date 
based on our existing policy of recording amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and deferred revenue where the customer has a legal obligation to pay  invoices from these renewal agreements are now recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon execution of the renewal agreement rather than at the start of the renewal period 
had we not revised the terms of these renewal agreements  we would have recorded approximately million less in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as of december  our subscription agreements provide service level commitments of uptime per period  excluding scheduled maintenance 
the failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their subscription and support fees 
in light of our historical experience with meeting our service level commitments  we do not currently have any liabilities on our balance sheet for these commitments 
revenue by geographic region  based on the billing address of the customer  was as follows for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in thousands united states international total revenue percentage of revenue generated outside of the united states employees as of december   our headcount was  employees including employees in sales and marketing  employees in operations  professional services  training and customer support  employees in product development  and employees in a general and administrative capacity 
cost of revenue subscription and support cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our application suite  providing customer support  data communications expenses  personnel and related costs of operations  stock based compensation  software license fees  outsourced subscription services  costs associated with website development activities  allocated overhead  amortization expense associated with capitalized internal use software and acquired developed technology  and related plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses 
professional services and other cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel and related costs for our professional services employees and executives  external consultants  stock based compensation and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead such as rent  information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
we expect cost of revenue to remain constant as a percentage of revenue over time  however  it could fluctuate period to period depending on the growth of our professional services business and any associated increased costs relating to the delivery of professional services and the timing of significant expenditures 
operating expenses product development product development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our product development employees and executives  including salaries  stock based compensation  employee benefits and allocated overhead 
our product development efforts have been devoted primarily to increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application suite as well as localizing our product for international use 
a key component of our strategy is to expand our business internationally 
this will require us to conform our application to comply with local regulations and languages  causing us to incur additional expenses related to translation and localization of our application for use in other countries 
at our product development facility in the czech republic  we participate in a government program that subsidizes us for employing local residents 
under the program  the czech government will reimburse us for certain operating expenses we incur 
during the year ended december   we reduced our product development expense for eligible operational expenses we expect the czech government to reimburse 
on a quarterly basis  we will accrue our expected subsidies for the duration of the program 

table of contents in  we expect product development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to extend our service offerings in other countries  and as we expand and enhance our application suite technologies 
such expenses may vary due to the timing of these offerings and technologies 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our sales and marketing employees and executives  including wages  benefits  bonuses  commissions and training  stock based compensation  commissions paid to our channel partners  the cost of marketing programs such as on line lead generation  promotional events  webinars and other meeting costs  amortization of intangible assets related to trade name and customer relationships  and allocated overhead 
we market and sell our application suite worldwide through our direct sales organization and indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers 
we capitalize and amortize our direct and channel sales commissions over the period the related revenue is recognized 
we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers and expand relationships with existing customers 
as such  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in terms of absolute dollars in general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  stock based compensation  legal and other professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
in  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in terms of absolute dollars as we continue to expand our business 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred annual operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than provisions for minimum and foreign income taxes 
critical accounting policies and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial position  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management judgment in its application  while in other cases  significant judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we consider these policies requiring significant management judgment to be critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  internal use software and website development costs  deferred commissions  accounting for stock based compensation  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
a description of our critical accounting policies and judgments for those areas are presented below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from two sources subscription and support services  and professional services and other 
subscription and support revenue includes subscription fees from customers accessing our cloud based application suite and support fees from customers purchasing support 
our arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud based application service at any time 
professional services and other 
table of contents revenue include fees from consultation services to support the business process mapping  configuration  data migration  integration and training 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for the most part  subscription and support agreements are entered into for to months 
in aggregate  more than of the professional services component of the arrangements with customers is performed within days of entering into a contract with the customer 
the subscription agreements provide service level commitments of uptime per period  excluding scheduled maintenance 
the failure to meet this level of service availability may require us to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their subscription and support fees 
in light of our historical experience with meeting our service level commitments  we do not currently have any liabilities on our balance sheet for these commitments 
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service is being provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
in most instances  revenue from a new customer acquisition is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements  comprised of subscription and support fees from customers accessing our cloud based application suite and professional services associated with consultation services 
we evaluate each element in a multiple element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within our control 
subscription and support have standalone value because we routinely sell it separately 
professional services have standalone value because we have sold professional services separately and there are several third party vendors that routinely provide similar professional services to our customers on a standalone basis 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple element revenue arrangements asu to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of each element if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require a vendor to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we early adopted this accounting guidance on april   for applicable arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  the beginning of our fiscal year 
prior to our adoption of asu  we were not able to establish vsoe or tpe for all of the undelivered elements 
as a result  we typically recognized subscription and support  and professional services revenue ratably over the contract period  and allocated subscription and support revenue and professional services revenue based on the contract price 
as a result of the adoption of asu  we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we have been unable to establish vsoe or tpe for the elements of our sales arrangements 
therefore  we establish the esp for each element primarily by considering the weighted average of actual sales prices of professional services when sold on a standalone basis and subscription and support including various add on modules when sold together without professional services  and other factors such as gross margin objectives  pricing practices and growth strategy 
the consideration allocated to subscription and support is recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period 
we have established processes to determine esp  allocate revenue in multiple arrangements using esp  and make reasonably dependable estimates of the percentage of completion method for professional services 
the consideration allocated to professional services and other is recognized as revenue on a percentage of completion method 
the total arrangement fee for a multiple element arrangement is allocated based on the relative esp of each element unless the fee allocated to the subscription and support under this method is less than the fee subject to refund if the performance conditions are not met 
in most multiple element arrangements  the relative esp of the subscription and support is less than the contractual amounts subject to the performance conditions 
in these instances  pursuant to asu  since the professional services are generally completed prior to completion of the subscription and support  the allocation of the fee for subscription and support is at least equal to the contractual amounts subject to the performance conditions 
prior to adoption of asu  in multiple element arrangements where we determined that a subset of professional services was essential to the customers use of the subscription services essential professional services arrangements  we deferred the commencement of revenue recognition for the entire arrangement until we have delivered the essential professional services component or made a determination that the remaining professional services were no longer essential to the customer 
with the adoption of asu  we recognize revenue for subscription and support services in 
table of contents such arrangement over the contract period commencing when the subscription service is made available to the customer and for professional services on a percentage of completion method 
for single element sales agreements  subscription and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the provisioning date of the contract 
prior to april   professional services revenue generated under single element sales agreements  was immaterial and therefore was recognized when fully delivered 
as of april   the date of adoption of asu  we recognized professional services revenue based on a percentage of completion method for both single and multiple element arrangements since we now separate the professional services revenue from subscription and support revenue 
cost related to professional services is recognized as incurred 
internal use software and website development costs the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment 
training costs are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal use software during the years ended december   or we capitalized million  million and  in internal use software during the years ended december   and  respectively 
deferred commissions we capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts 
commission costs are accrued and capitalized upon execution of the sales contract by the customer 
payments to sales personnel are made shortly after the receipt of the related customer payment 
deferred commissions are amortized over the term of the related non cancelable customer contract and are recoverable through the related future revenue streams 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission costs are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be expensed over the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
we capitalized commission costs of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants  which generally equals a four year vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for stock option awards  restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense related to performance share awards based on the accelerated method which recognizes a larger portion of the expense during the beginning of the vesting period than in the end of the vesting period 
estimates are used in determining the fair value of stock option awards using a black scholes model 
the fair value of restricted stock  restricted stock units performance share and performance share units is generally determined based on the intrinsic value of the award on the grant date 
our performance share unit grants included a market condition performance criteria so we used a monte carlo simulation model to determine their fair value 
changes in the estimates used to determine the fair value of share based equity compensation instruments could result in changes to our compensation charges 
additionally  our performance share unit grants vest per quarter with the initial vesting event on february  in  performance metrics for certain performance shares awarded for and had not been set by our board of directors 
as such  there is no accounting for these awards until the performances metrics are set 
in recent years  we have awarded more restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance share units than granted stock options 
consequently  our restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance share units stock based compensation expense represents a larger portion of total stock based compensation expense recorded in our financial statements than stock options 
as a result of our stock based compensation activity  we recorded million  million and million of stock based compensation during the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of our acquired businesses to intangible assets  including customer relationships  developed technology and trade names that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years 
we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to tangible assets and assessed the liabilities to be recorded as part of the purchase price 
the estimates we made in allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets  and in assessing liabilities recorded as part of the purchase  involved the application of judgment and the use of estimates and these could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value based on our market capitalization and the market 
table of contents multiples of revenue and gross profit for publicly traded peer companies 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the estimates we make in determining the fair value of the reporting unit involve the application of judgment potentially affecting the timing and size of any future impairment charges 
impairment of our goodwill could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
based on our most recent assessment  there was no goodwill impairment 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets 
we must use judgment in evaluating whether events or circumstances indicate that useful lives should change or that the carrying value of assets has been impaired 
any resulting revision in the useful life or the amount of impairment also requires judgment 
any of these judgments could affect the timing or size of any future impairment charges 
revision of useful lives or impairment charges could significantly affect our operating results and financial position 
in  we acquired quickarrow qa for approximately million and assigned million to the developed technology intangible asset 
the qa developed technology was being amortized over a four year period to cost of revenue 
qa computing solutions for professional services businesses has advanced our cloud computing application suite for services based companies 
in the second quarter of  certain qa customers transitioned from the qa service offering to a netsuite service offering or terminated their service completely resulting in the carrying value of the qa developed technology assets exceeding the revised undiscounted expected future cash flows for the service 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount of the qa developed technology over the fair value of such asset as of june  we amortized the remaining  net carrying value of the asset over the second half of which was the period the intangible asset generated revenue 
there were no impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   or results of operations revenue and cost of revenue our revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin was as follows for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue subscription and support professional services and other total revenue cost of revenue subscription and support professional services and other total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin includes stock based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets of cost of revenue subscription and support professional services and other compared to revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period in subscription and support revenue subscription and support revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in revenue resulting from the acquisition of new customers including the continued adoption of oneworld  and a million

in the year ended december   cash flows from operations generated million of cash 
despite the possibility of such fluctuations in operating cash outflows  management believes its current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for the next months and into the foreseeable future thereafter to meet our operating cash flow needs 
we intend to use our cash for general corporate purposes  including potential future acquisitions or other transactions 
further  we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with our international expansion 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are adequate to fund those anticipated activities 
while we believe that our uncommitted current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months  we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility or sell certain assets 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
as we believe that our cash and cash equivalents are adequate to fund our operating and investing cash flow needs for at least the next months  we have not found it necessary to reassess our capacity to generate cash from financing cash flows in the current economic climate 
if additional financing becomes necessary and we are unable to obtain the additional funds  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  potentially harming our business  financial condition and operating results 
in the meantime  we intend to continue to manage our cash in a manner designed to ensure that we have adequate cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations as well as future acquisitions  if any

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  these amounts were held primarily in money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes  and restricted cash amounts are held as security against various lease obligations 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
foreign currency risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  philippine peso  uruguayan peso and the czech koruna 
our revenue is generally denominated in the local currency of the contracting party 
the majority of our invoicing relates to sales occurring in the united states and therefore is denominated in us dollars 
we have an increasing percentage of sales denominated in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the local currencies of australia  the united kingdom and canada 
our expenses are incurred primarily in the united states  canada  the philippines  australia and the united kingdom  with a small portion of expenses incurred in other countries where our international sales and operations offices are located 
our results of operations and cash flows are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the year ended december   the us dollar decreased against the foreign currencies that our invoicing and operational expenses are denominated in by approximately when compared to the same period in the prior year 
for the year ended december   the fluctuation in foreign currency rates negatively affected our income by approximately  during the year ended december   we continued a hedging program initiated in to limit the exposure of foreign currency risk resulting from the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities through the use of forward exchange contracts 
see balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities in note under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements of part  item  financial statements herein for further disclosures 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have a material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of money market funds that invest primarily in highly liquid investments with maturities of two months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
