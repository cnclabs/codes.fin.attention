we expect to incur substantial research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales  marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure 
we believe the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december   the net proceeds of million from our january convertible debt offering  and the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next months 
we based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change  and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect 
if we acquire additional assets or companies  accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials  we will need additional funds 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including possible acquisitions  the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing  and our success in developing markets for our product candidates

the preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable  including contractual obligations in connection with product license agreements and contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation 
we recognize equity based compensation as an expense in our financial statements and that cost is measured at the fair value of the awards and expensed over their vesting period 
equity based compensation arrangements to non employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of equity based awards 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
purchase price allocations and appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process research and development projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the als  farmadiet  and ourlab assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventories  remaining shelf life  and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
we analyze accounts 
table of contents receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method 
our reported net loss is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and was million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
on january   we adopted an amendment issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to the accounting standards related to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this amendment revises the existing guidance on the use and application of fair value measurements and maintains a definition of fair value that it is based on the notion of exit price 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted amendments issued by the fasb to the accounting standards related to comprehensive income 
these amendments revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements and remove the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
these amendments require an entity to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income  or two separate but consecutive statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
we modified our consolidated financial statements presentation using the latter alternative 
on january   we adopted revised guidance issued by the fasb related to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
under the revise guidance  an entity has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value prior to performing the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if  based on the qualitative factors  an entity determines that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then the entity would not be required to perform the two step quantitative impairment test for that reporting unit 
however  if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  then the quantitative assessment must be performed 
an entity is permitted to perform the qualitative assessment on none  some or all of its reporting units and may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and begin with the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment 
this amendment did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we may from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at maturity  and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  primarily to hedge chilean based operating cash flows against us dollars 
if chilean pesos were to strengthen in relation to the us dollar  our loss or gain on hedged foreign currency cash flows would be offset by the derivative contracts  with a net effect of zero 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price  or equity price risk 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings 
we maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the weighted average interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was 
as of december   the principal value of our credit lines was million at a weighted average interest rate of approximately the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  bank obligations  repurchase agreements and high quality corporate issuers  and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three months
