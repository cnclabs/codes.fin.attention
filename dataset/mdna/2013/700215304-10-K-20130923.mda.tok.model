fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal refer to the fiscal year ended june  sources of revenue the company derives revenue from four sources subscription fees  hosting  premium support and maintenance service fees beyond the standard services offered  license fees  and professional services consisting of development services  consulting  training and education 
subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of connections between suppliers and retailers  the number of stores and sku s 
subscription revenue contains arrangements with customers accessing our applications  which includes the use of the application  application and data hosting  subscription based maintenance of the application and standard support included with the subscription 
our hosting services provide remote management and maintenance of our software and customers data  which is physically located in third party facilities 
customers access hosted software and data through a secure internet connection 
premium support services include technical assistance for our software products and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis beyond what is offered with our basic subscription package 
license arrangements are a perpetual license 
software license maintenance agreements are typically annual contracts with customers that are paid in advance or according to terms specified in the contract 
this provides the customer access to new software enhancements  maintenance releases  patches  updates and technical support personnel 
professional services revenue is comprised of revenue from development  consulting  education and training 
development services include customizations and integrations for a client s specific business application 
consulting  education and training include implementation and best practices consulting 
our professional services fees are more frequently billed on a fixed price fixed scope  but may also be billed on a time and materials basis 
we have determined that the professional services element of our software and subscription arrangements is not essential to the functionality of the software 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we commenced operations in the software development and professional services business during the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience of operations and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  will affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of the company s net deferred income tax assets  the company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to realize the benefit of these assets 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit in the company s statements of operations 
management evaluates whether or not to realize the deferred income tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance quarterly 
goodwill and other long lived asset valuations goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
management reviews the long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
management evaluates  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
economic useful lives of long lived assets are assessed and adjusted as circumstances dictate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement beginning on the commencement dates of each agreement or when revenue recognition conditions are satisfied 
for a fee  subscriptions provide the customer with access to the software and data over the internet  or on demand  and provide technical support services and software upgrades when and if available 
under subscriptions  customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and such arrangements are considered service contracts 
accordingly  we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the length of the agreement and professional services are recognized as incurred based on their relative fair values 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contract term 
when subscription service is paid in advance  deferred revenue is recognized and revenue is recorded ratably over the term as services are consumed 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the applicable agreement 
hosting  premium support and maintenance service revenue is derived from services beyond the basic services provided in standard arrangements 
we recognize hosting  premium service and maintenance revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contact or when revenue recognition conditions are satisfied 
instances where hosting  premium support or maintenance service is paid in advance  deferred revenue is recognized and revenue is recording ratably over the term as services are consumed 
professional services revenue consists primarily of fees associated with application and data integration  data cleansing  business process re engineering  change management and education and training services 
fees charged for professional services are recognized when delivered 
we believe the fees for professional services qualify for separate accounting because i the services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  ii objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for these services and iii performance of the services is considered probable and does not involve unique customer acceptance criteria 
we also sell software licenses 
for software license sales  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the service has been provided to the customer  iii the collection of our fees is probable and iv the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
licenses generally include multiple elements that are delivered up front or over time 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the hosting and support elements is based on the price charged at renewal when sold separately  and the license element is recognized into revenue upon delivery 
the hosting and support elements are recognized ratably over the contractual term 
stock based compensation the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company records compensation expense on a straight line basis 
the fair value of options granted are estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
capitalization of software development costs the company accounts for research costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed as expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly after a working prototype is complete and meets or exceeds design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have been and will continue to be capitalized until such time as when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue and results of operation  liquidity or capital expenditures 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and revenue fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent subscription other revenues total revenue during the fiscal year ended june   the company had total revenue of  compared to  for the year ended june   a increase 
this  increase in total revenue was principally due to an increase of  in subscription revenue and an increase of  in other revenue  as more particularly described below 
management believes that the company s strategy of pursuing contracts with suppliers spokes to connect to retail customers hubs that have been added in the most recently completed fiscal year  including the service agreement with cvs pharmacy  inc  announced in july  will continue to result in increased revenue during the fiscal year ending june   and in subsequent periods 
in addition  management believes that revenue in subsequent periods will increase as a result of the receipt of subscription payments from repositraktm resulting from the license of the company s technology necessary to power respositraktm 
respositraktm enables grocery  supermarkets  packaged goods manufacturers  food processing facilities  drug stores and drug manufacturers  as well as logistics partners  to track and trace products and components to products throughout the food  drug and dietary supplement supply chains 
subscription revenue subscription revenue was  and  in and respectively  an increase of 
this  increase in the year ended june  when compared with the year ended june  was principally due to i the increase of subscription customers added to the company s customer base  including repositrak  which contributed approximately million in new subscription revenue  and ii a  increase attributable to the growth of existing retailer and supplier subscriptions 
the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  resulting from the non renewal of existing clients  including the non renewal of a significant retail client and related connections in january while no assurances can be given  the company anticipates that revenue from subscription based services will continue to increase on a year over year basis 
the company continues to focus its strategic initiatives on increasing the number of retailers  suppliers and manufacturers that use its software on a subscription basis 
however  while management believes that marketing its suite of software solutions as a renewable and recurring subscription is an effective strategy  it cannot be assured that subscribers will renew the service at the same level in future years  propagate services to new categories or recognize the need for expanding the service offering of the company s suite of actionable products and services 
other revenue other revenue was  and  in and  respectively  an increase of 
this  increase in the year ended june  when compared with the year ended june  was principally due to i an increase in other revenue related to a management agreement with repositrak and ii license sales to existing customers 
these increases were partially offset by i maintenance cancellations resulting in a net decrease in maintenance revenue of approximately  and ii a decrease in professional services revenue of  resulting from the shift to subscription based revenue 
while these other sources of revenue will continue in future periods  management s focus on recurring subscription based revenue will cause license  maintenance and consulting services to fluctuate and be difficult to predict

this decrease of  for the year ended june  when compared with the same period ended june  is principally due to a  decrease in employee related expenses

other income and expense fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent other gains interest expense total other expense income net other expense income was net other expense of  when compared with net other income of  for the year ended june  and june   respectively

preferred dividends fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent preferred dividends percent of total revenue dividends accrued on the company s series a preferred and series b preferred was  and  for the year ended june  and june   respectively 
before the series a redemption in april  holders of series a preferred were entitled to a annual dividend payable quarterly in either cash or additional series a preferred at the option of the company with fractional shares paid in cash 
this dividend rate increased to per annum as a result of the average closing price of the company s common stock during the last thirty trading days of the quarter ending december  being less than per share a dividend adjustment 
holders of series b preferred are entitled to a annual dividend payable quarterly in cash

 shares were redeemed for per share  or an aggregate total of  and the remaining  shares were converted into shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred redeemed  or an aggregate total of  shares of the company common stock 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources we believe our existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth and expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cash and cash equivalents we have historically funded our operations with cash from operations  equity financings and debt borrowings 
cash and cash equivalents was  and  at june   and june   respectively

net cash flows from operating activities fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent cash flows used in provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by operating activities is summarized as follows net income loss noncash expense and income  net net changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash expense increased by  in compared to noncash expense increased as a result of a  gain in the that did not recur in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of  and a decrease in stock based compensation of  the net changes in operating assets and liabilities used  more cash in compared to this is primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable from the conversion of some accounts receivable to notes 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in deferred and an increase prepaid expenses

fiscal year ended june  variance dollars percent current assets current assets at june  totaled  an increase of  when compared to  at june  this increase in current assets is due primarily proceeds from financing activities specifically the capital raise in march  partially offset by normal fluctuations in operating assets

the  comparative decrease in current liabilities is principally due to decreases in  deferred revenue  the current portion of notes and capital leases of  and accrued liabilities of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  while no assurances can be given  management currently intends to continue to reduce its indebtedness in subsequent periods utilizing existing cash resources and projected cash flow from operations 
in addition  management may also continue to refinance or restructure certain of the company s indebtedness to extend the maturities of such indebtedness to address its short term and long term working capital requirements 
management believes that these initiatives will enable us to address our debt service requirements during the next twelve months  as well as fund our currently anticipated operations and capital spending requirements 
inflation the impact of inflation has historically not had a material effect on the company s financial condition or results from operations  however  higher rates of inflation may cause retailers to slow their spending in the technology area  which could have an impact on the company s sales 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the main purpose of this update is to clarify that the disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities per asu apply to derivatives including embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions that are offset or subject to a master netting agreement 
other types of transactions are not impacted 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  and for all interim periods within that fiscal year 
the company doesn t expect this update to impact the company s financials since it does not have instruments noted in the update that are offset 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
the company plans to adopt asu for fiscal and does not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements
