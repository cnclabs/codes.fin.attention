business overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   both appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
ceva is the world s leading licensor of dsp cores and platform solutions 
our technologies are widely licensed and power many of the world s leading semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer oem companies 
in  our licensees shipped more than one billion ceva powered chipsets targeted for a wide range of diverse end markets 
to date  more than billion ceva powered devices have shipped  illustrating the strong market deployment of our technology 
during the past six years  our business has shown profitability growth and market share expansion as a result of the widespread deployment of our dsp cores with all major handset oems  including htc  huawei  lenovo  lg electronics  motorola  nokia  samsung  sony and zte 
based on internal data and strategy analytics worldwide shipment data  ceva s worldwide market share of cellular baseband chips that incorporate our technologies was approximately of the worldwide shipment volume based on preliminary data for third quarter worldwide shipments 
revenues derived from the handset and mobile broadband markets accounted for approximately of our total revenues for we believe the adoption of our dsp cores and technologies in the handset and mobile broadband markets continues to progress 
specifically  we believe the emergence of merchant g cellular chips from companies such as broadcom  intel and spreadtrum  all of whom are our customers  are strong positive drivers for our future market share expansion 
moreover  strategy analytics forecasts that worldwide cellular baseband shipments will grow by in to reach billion units 
we believe that the majority of this growth will come from low cost g smartphones in developing countries  especially china  and the broader adoption of g lte based advanced smartphones in mature markets 
we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth in these segments  as well as growth from other mobile connected devices such as tablets  notebooks and other machine to machine devices  as key chip suppliers serving these markets use our technologies broadly 
beyond products enabled by our technologies for cellular baseband communications  we continue to strategically target growth in non baseband applications  such as audio  voice  imaging  vision and connectivity 
advanced audio and wideband voice processing requires significantly more dsp performance than existing solutions used in smartphones  automotive and digital home applications 
our audio voice product lines  including the ceva teaklite iii and new ceva teaklite dsps  are ideally positioned to address these requirements  and can enable us to continue to expand our licensing base in these markets 
we believe the following key elements represent significant growth drivers for the company ceva is firmly established in the largest space in the semiconductor industry baseband for mobile handset as well as the other evolving cellular markets  such as mobile computing and machine to machine 
our competitive edge in software defined radio technology for the next generations of lte 
table of contents and wi fi  and the inherent low cost and power performance balance of our technologies  puts us in a strong position to simultaneously capitalize on mass market adoption and address all of the growth vectors of the space 
our proven track record in baseband technologies  in particular our pioneering position in software defined radio  allows us to expand into the base station market  including the high volume potential in small cells 
the spectral efficiency of lte enables additional and very interesting new opportunities for dsp related products 
one such use is voice over lte  where higher bit rate speech codecs combined with advanced noise and echo cancellation  allow substantially clearer phone calls along with higher intelligibility that is required for services such as voice recognition 
the market potential for image enhancement and vision analytics in cameras offers a new growth segment for the company 
our mm platform is the only one in the industry today that offers a unified vision and imaging platform that can support these future developments 
per abi research  one billion cameras were shipped in  and this number is predicted to grow to billion in of this volume is attributable to smartphones  where we already have a strong foothold through our other technologies 
mobile oems are looking for new dslr features such as smarter autofocus  best picture using super resolution algorithms  and better image capture in low light environments 
furthermore  with the addition of video analytics support  cameras will enable new services like augmented reality  gesture recognition and advanced safety capabilities in cars 
we see this new revolution as an emerging opportunity for us to significantly expand our footprint in smartphones and further into tablets  pcs and automotive applications 
notwithstanding the various growth opportunities we have outlined above  our business operates in a highly competitive environment 
the maintenance of our competitive position and our future growth are dependent on our ability to adapt to ever changing technologies  short product life cycles  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and the trend towards cellular connectivity  and voice  audio and video convergence in the markets that we operate 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
royalty payments under our existing license agreements also could be lower than currently anticipated for a variety of reasons  including decreased royalty rates triggered by larger volume shipments  lower royalty rates negotiated with customers due to competitive pressure or consolidation among our customers 
moreover  some of our competitors have reduced their licensing and royalty fees to attract customers and expand their market share 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our existing products  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices which may result in lower profits 
in addition  our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also the successful introduction of new products  which requires the dedication of resources into research and development which in turn may increase our operating expenses 
furthermore  since our products are incorporated into end products of our oem and semiconductor customers  our business is very dependent on their ability to achieve market acceptance of their end products in the handset and consumer electronic markets  which are similarly very competitive 
in addition  macroeconomic trends may significantly affect our operating results 
for example  consolidation among our customers may negatively affect our revenue source  increase our existing customers negotiation leverage and make us more dependent on a limited number of customers 
also  since we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the handset market  any negative trends in that market would adversely affect our financial results 
according to latest research from gartner  global mobile phones sales declined by year on year  from billion to billion 
the last time gartner reported a decline was in nonetheless  based on our shipment data  we managed to buck this global handset market decline by increasing shipment volumes in more significantly  we managed to capture a greater portion of g shipments based on ceva dsps  recording a year over year growth 
however  the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries remain volatile  which makes it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast financial results and plan for future business activities 
our license arrangements have not historically provided for substantial ongoing license payments so revenue 
table of contents recognized from licensing arrangements vary significantly from period to period  depending on the number and size of deals closed during a quarter  and is difficult to predict 
moreover  our royalty revenue is based on the sales of products incorporating the semiconductors or other products of our customers  and as a result we do not have direct access to information that will help us anticipate the timing and amount of future royalties 
we have very little visibility into the timetable of product shipments incorporating our technology by our customers 
as a result  our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  income taxes  equity based compensation  and impairment of marketable securities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of business or market conditions 
management s judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
we generate our revenues from licensing intellectual property  which in certain circumstances is modified for customer specific requirements  royalty revenues and other revenues  which include revenues from support  training and sale of development systems 
we license our ip to semiconductor companies throughout the world 
these semiconductor companies then manufacture  market and sell custom designed chipsets to oems of a variety of consumer electronics products 
we also license our technology directly to oems  which are considered end users 
we account for our ip license revenues and related services in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and no further obligation exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
a license may be perpetual or time limited in its application 
revenue earned on licensing arrangements involving multiple elements are allocated to each element based on the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and vsoe does not exist for one of the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the substantive renewal rate as stated in the agreement 

table of contents extended payment terms in a licensing arrangement may indicate that the license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer unless collection is not considered reasonably assured  then revenue is recognized as payments are collected from the customer  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from license fees that involve significant customization of our ip to customer specific specifications are recognized in accordance with the principles set out in fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts recognition  using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the agreement and the percentage of completion achieved 
the percentage of completion is measured by the actual time incurred to date on the project compared to the total estimated project requirements  which correspond to the costs related to earned revenues 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made during the period in which such losses are first determined  in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
royalties from licensing the right to use our ip are recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenues received by our licensees on sales of products incorporating our ip components or on a per unit basis  as specified in the agreements with the licensees 
we determine such revenues by receiving confirmation of sales subject to royalties from licensees 
non refundable payments on account of future royalties prepaid royalties are included within our licensing revenue line on the statement of income 
we may engage a third party to perform royalty audits of our licensees  and if these audits indicate any over or under reported royalties  we account for the results when the audits are resolved 
in addition to license fees  contracts with customers generally contain an agreement to provide for post contract support and training  which consists of telephone or e mail support  correction of errors bug fixing and unspecified updates and upgrades 
fees for post contract support  which takes place after delivery to the customer  are specified in the contract and are generally mandatory for the first year 
after the mandatory period  the customer may extend the support agreement on similar terms on an annual basis 
we recognize revenue for post contract support on a straight line basis over the period for which technical support is contractually agreed to be provided to the licensee 
revenue from training is recognized as the training is performed 
revenue from the sale of development systems is recognized when title to the product passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we usually do not provide rights of return 
when rights of return are included in the license agreements  revenue is deferred until rights of return expire 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes mainly in israel  the us and ireland 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we recognize income taxes under the liability method 
tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  the refinement of an estimate or changes in tax laws 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
accounting for tax positions requires judgments  including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties 
we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes  including those in the form of carry forwards for which the 
table of contents benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements 
we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe are more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december  and are appropriately accounted for  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further information regarding income taxes 
we have filed or are in the process of filing local and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by the tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
we believe that we adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to tax audits and settlement 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statute of limitations on potential assessments expire 
equity based compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with fasb asc no 
 stock compensation which requires the recognition of compensation expenses based on estimated fair values for all equity based awards made to employees and non employee directors 
we estimate the fair value of equity based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statement of income 
we recognize compensation expenses for the value of our awards  which have graded vesting based on the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period of each of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures and the rate is adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances  if any 
estimated forfeiture rate will be revised if actual forfeitures differ from the initial estimates 
we use the monte carlo simulation model for options and stock appreciation rights sars granted 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date  equal to the expected option term 
we have historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans to pay dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
the monte carlo model also considers the contractual term of the option and sar  the probability that the option and sar will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of termination or retirement of the option and sar holder in computing the value of the option and sar 
although our management believes that their estimates and judgments about equity based compensation expense are reasonable  actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
impairment of marketable securities marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and government securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 investment debt and equity securities  we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are stated at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes 
realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in financial income  net 
the amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity  both of which  together with interest  are included in financial income  net 
we have classified all marketable securities as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because we may sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of risk versus reward objectives 

table of contents we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments in debt securities below the cost basis of such securities is judged to be other than temporary 
the determination of credit losses requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different from our estimates 
factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value  the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations  the potential recovery period and our intent to sell  including whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of cost basis 
for securities that are deemed other than temporarily impaired  the amount of impairment is recognized in the statement of income and is limited to the amount related to credit losses  while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
during the years ended december   and  no other than temporary impairment were recorded related to our marketable securities 
results of operations the following table presents line items from our consolidated statements of income as percentages of our total revenues for the periods indicated consolidated statements of income data revenues licensing royalties other revenue total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development  net sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income financial income  net income before taxes on income income tax expenses net income discussion and analysis below we provide information on the significant line items in our consolidated statements of income for each of the past three fiscal years  including the percentage changes year on year  as well as an analysis of the principal drivers of change in these line items from year to year 
revenues total revenues total revenues in millions change year on year 
table of contents the decrease in total revenues from to reflected lower royalty revenues  lower licensing revenues and slightly lower other revenues 
the increase in total revenues from to principally reflected a combination of significantly higher royalty revenues and higher licensing revenues offset by slightly lower other revenues 
we generate royalty revenue from our customers based on two models royalties paid by our customers during the period in which they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technologies  which we refer to as per unit royalties  and royalties which are paid in a lump sum and in advance to cover a pre defined fixed number of future unit shipments  which we refer to as prepaid royalties 
in either case  these royalties are non refundable payments 
prepaid royalties are included within our licensing revenue line on the statement of income and accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
only royalty revenue from customers who are paying as they ship units of chipsets incorporating our technology is recognized in our royalty revenue line 
these per unit royalties are invoiced and recognized on a quarterly basis in arrears as we receive quarterly shipment reports from our licensees 
we derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers 
three customers separately accounted for  and of our total revenues for one customer accounted for  and of our total revenues for  and  respectively 
generally  the identity of our customers representing or more of our total revenues varies from period to period  especially with respect to our licensing customers as we generate licensing revenues generally from new customers on a quarterly and annual basis 
with respect to our royalty revenues  four royalty paying customers each represented or more of our total royalty revenues for and  and collectively represented and of our total royalty revenues for and  respectively 
however  two of the four or more royalty paying customers in and did not exceed of our total royalty revenues for we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers 
the concentration of our customers is explainable in part by consolidation in the semiconductor industry 
the loss of any significant customer could adversely affect our near term future operating results 
the following table sets forth the products and services that represented or more of our total revenues in each of the periods set forth below year ended december  ceva x family ceva teaklite family ceva teak family we expect these products will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues for the remaining amount consists of other families of products and services that each represented less than of our total revenues 
revenues derived from the handsets and mobile broadband markets represented approximately of our total revenues for both and  and of our total revenues for licensing revenues licensing revenues in millions change year on year 
table of contents the decrease in licensing revenues from to principally reflected lower revenues from our ceva x dsp core family of products and ceva teak dsp core family of products  partially offset by higher revenues from our ceva teaklite dsp core family of products

fast wired modems and audio applications 
licensing revenues accounted for of our total revenues for  compared with and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
the percentage decreases in licensing revenues principally reflect lower licensing revenues 
in  we signed new license agreements  compared to and in and  respectively 
royalty revenues royalty revenues in millions change year on year based on strategic analytics and internal data  ceva s worldwide market share of baseband chips that incorporate our technologies represented approximately  and of the worldwide baseband volume based on third quarter shipments in  and  respectively  and accounted for approximately  and of our total royalty revenues for  and  respectively 
generally  the average royalty per unit from baseband chips incorporating our technologies is lower than the average royalty per unit from other consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies 
the decrease in royalty revenues from to was due to i intel s design loss of the iphone baseband socket which shipped in large volume in in comparison to and this baseband socket from intel incorporated ceva s technology and bore higher royalty average selling prices than other g phones that incorporate ceva s technology  and ii a significant g baseband chip price erosion in which had a direct negative effect on our royalty revenue as most of our royalty arrangements for the g segment is based on a percent of chip sales price 
these negative trends were partially offset by higher quantities of g and smartphones excluding the iphone shipments which bore higher royalty average selling prices 
the increase in royalty revenues from to principally reflected the continued expansion of our dsps across both handset and non handset cellular enabled products  which were driven by large volume g  g and td scdma phones  partially offset by a decrease in the average per unit royalty rate 
the five largest customers paying royalty accounted for of our total royalty revenues in  compared to and in and  respectively 
our royalty customers reported sales of  million chipsets incorporating our technologies in  compared to  million in and million in 
the increase in units shipped in both as compared to and as compared to primarily result from the strong momentum in the shipments of cellular processors enabled by our dsps that are now widely deployed across all market segments 
other revenues other revenues include support and training for licensees and sale of development systems 
other revenues in millions change year on year 
table of contents the slight decrease in other revenues in both as compared to and in as compared to principally reflect a decrease in support revenues  offset by an increase in revenues from sales of development systems 
as the other revenue component is directly associated with licensing revenue and none of the components that comprise other revenue support  training and development systems is significant compared to our total revenue  starting in the first quarter of  we plan to consolidate other revenue with licensing revenue into one revenue line titled licensing and related revenue for the sake of simplicity 
geographic revenue analysis in millions  except percentages united states europe  middle east eme asia pacific apac germany switzerland china japan less than due to the nature of our license agreements and the associated potential large individual contract amounts  the geographic spilt of revenues both in absolute dollars and percentage terms generally varies from period to period 
the decrease in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the united states from to reflects lower licensing activities due to general economic uncertainty and prolonged decision making process for new and advanced designs and technologies 
this decrease was partially offset by a large key customer that increased its g baseband shipments  which increased our royalty revenue derived from the united states 
the increase in revenues in absolute dollars and percentage terms in the united states from to reflects more design activities in the united states by large semiconductor companies and oems  mainly for our dsp core products  and royalty ramp up mainly from cellular products 
the decrease in revenues in absolute dollars in the eme region from to primarily reflects lower royalty revenue mainly due to the g baseband price erosion and intel s loss of the iphone baseband socket 
in addition  licensing activity in the eme region was minimal due to the on going european union economic difficulties 
the increase in revenues in absolute term in the eme region from to primarily reflects significantly higher royalty revenues and unit shipment ramp up from cellular products  offset by a continued decrease in licensing activities in the eme region due to the consolidation of semiconductor companies and overall economic slowdown 
the increase in revenues in absolute dollars in the apac region from to primarily reflects higher licensing revenues  mainly due to strong licensing activities in japan  offset by overall lower royalty revenue mainly due to price erosion of g baseband average selling prices in the local chinese market 
the increase in revenues in absolute terms in the apac region from to primarily reflects significantly higher royalty revenues and unit shipment ramp up from cellular products 
in  we also generated significantly higher licensing revenues from our dsp core products for audio applications and lte designs  as well as from our bluetooth ip

cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments 
our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses 
our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our accounts receivable and interest earned from our cash  deposits and marketable securities 
the timing of receipts of accounts receivable from customers is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts

in august  we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million shares of common stock 
in may  we announced that our board of directors approved the expansion of our share repurchase program by another two million shares of common stock  with one million shares available for repurchase in accordance with rule b  which plan terminated by its terms in november and one million shares available for repurchase in accordance with rule b in january  our board of directors reaffirmed its authorization for our repurchase of the remaining  shares of common stock previously authorized pursuant to rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended

we believe that our current cash on hand  short term deposits and marketable securities  along with cash from operations  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies and minority equity investments 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses or minority equity investments 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  complete acquisitions or investments  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we may seek to expand our business in ways that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses

contractual obligations the table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations leasehold properties operating lease obligations other purchase obligations total 
table of contents operating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in ireland  israel and the united states 
other operating lease obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools 
purchase obligations consist of capital and operating purchase order commitments 
other than set forth in the table above  we have no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
at december   our income tax payable  net of withholding tax credits  included  related to uncertain tax positions 
due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits  the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments 
as a result  this amount is not included in the above table 
in addition  at december   the amount of accrued severance pay was  severance pay relates to accrued severance obligations to our israeli employees as required under israeli labor laws 
these obligations are payable only upon termination  retirement or death of the respective employee 
of this amount  only  is unfunded 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  the majority of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the nis  and in some extent the euro and the british pound 
increases in volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the us dollar versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when remeasured into us dollars 
we review our monthly expected non us dollar denominated expenditures and look to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations 
this has resulted in a foreign exchange loss of  and million for  and  respectively 
the foreign exchange losses arose principally on the euro and the nis assets and liabilities as a result of the currency fluctuations of the euro and the nis against the dollar 
as a result of currency fluctuations and the remeasurement of non us dollar denominated expenditures to non us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and quarterly basis 
to protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flow resulting from salaries paid in currencies other than the us dollar during the year  we follow a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of the anticipated payroll for our non us employees denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for a period of one to twelve months with forward and option contracts 
during  and  we recorded accumulated other comprehensive gain of  accumulated other comprehensive loss of  and accumulated other comprehensive gain of  respectively  from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  with respect to anticipated payroll expenses for our non us employees 
as of december   the amount of other comprehensive gain from our forward and option contracts  net of taxes  was  which will be recorded in the consolidated statements of income during the following months 
we recognized a net loss of million for  and a net gain of million for both and  related to forward and options contracts 
we note that hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate and currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis 
the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in high grade certificates of deposits with major us  european and israeli banks 
generally  cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits may be redeemed and 
table of contents therefore minimal credit risk exists with respect to them 
nonetheless  deposits with these banks exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions  to the extent such deposits are even insured in such foreign jurisdictions 
while we monitor on a systematic basis the cash and cash equivalent balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit our funds fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss of principal or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected if the financial institutions that we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail 
we hold an investment portfolio consisting principally of corporate bonds 
we intend  and have the ability  to hold such investments until recovery of temporary declines in market value or maturity  accordingly  as of december   we believe the losses associated with our investments are temporary and no impairment loss was recognized in however  we can provide no assurance that we will recover present declines in the market value of our investments 
interest income and gains and losses from marketable securities  net  were million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income  and gains and losses from marketable securities  net  in both as compared to and as compared to reflected higher combined cash  bank deposits and marketable securities balances held and higher yields 
we are exposed primarily to fluctuations in the level of us israeli and emu european monetary union interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates rise  fixed interest investments may be adversely impacted  whereas a decline in interest rates may decrease the anticipated interest income for variable rate investments 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we currently do not have any derivative instruments but may put them in place in the future 
fluctuations in interest rates within our investment portfolio have not had  and we do not currently anticipate such fluctuations will have  a material effect on our financial position on an annual or quarterly basis
