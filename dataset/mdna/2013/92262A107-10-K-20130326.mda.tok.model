critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition  impairment analysis of intangibles and stock based compensation 
the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the company has adopted 
in order to get a full understanding of the company s financial statements  one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed 
a summary of the company s critical accounting policies follows investments the company invests excess cash from time to time in highly liquid debt and equity securities of highly rated entities which are classified as trading securities 
such amounts are recorded at market and are classified as current  as the company does not intend to hold the investments beyond twelve months 
such excess funds are invested under the company s investment policy but an unexpected decline or loss could have an adverse and material effect on the carrying value  recoverability or investment returns of such investments 
our board has approved an investment policy covering the investment parameters to be followed with the primary goals being the safety of principal amounts and maintaining liquidity of the fund 
the policy provides for minimum investment rating requirements as well as limitations on investment duration and concentrations 
intangible assets intangible assets primarily represent legal costs and filings associated with obtaining patents on the company s new discoveries 
the company amortizes these costs over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its estimated economic life using the straight line method

dispositions of property and equipment are recorded in the period of disposition and any resulting gains or losses are charged to income or expense when the disposal occurs 
the company reviews for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment 
the required annual testing resulted in no impairment charges being recorded to date 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when products are shipped or delivered to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to select revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with sab no 
revenue is recognized under sales  license and distribution agreements only after the following criteria are met i there exists adequate evidence of the transactions  ii delivery of goods has occurred or services have been rendered  and iii the price is not contingent on future activity and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation asc  share based payment  defines the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans and transactions used by the company to account for its issuances of equity instruments to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value as well as to acquire goods or services from non employees 
transactions in which the company issues stock based compensation to employees  directors and consultants and for goods or services received from non employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
the company utilizes pricing models in determining the fair values of options and warrants issued as stock based compensation 
these pricing models utilize the market price of the company s common stock and the exercise price of the option or warrant  as well as time value and volatility factors underlying the positions 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements the company has evaluated all recently issued accounting pronouncements and believes such pronouncements do not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk general we have limited exposure to market risks from instruments that may impact the balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows 
such exposure is due primarily to changing interest rates 
interest rates the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing excess cash in highly liquid debt and equity investments of highly rated entities which are classified as trading securities 
as of december   approximately of the investment portfolio was in cash equivalents with very short term maturities and therefore not subject to any significant interest rate fluctuations 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
