our merchandise assortment includes apparel for all ages  accessories including fragrances  footwear and home fashions 
the origins of gordmans date back to  and as of february   we operated stores in states situated in a variety of shopping center developments  including regional enclosed shopping malls  lifestyle centers and power centers 
our expansion strategy includes opening ten new stores in fiscal in six new markets and one new state after opening nine new stores in four new markets  including two new states  in fiscal and six new stores in fiscal in three new markets 
our objective is to increase our store base in excess of annually 
in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
these key measures include net sales and comparable store sales and other individual store performance factors  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses 
net sales 
net sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts and exclusive of sales tax 
net sales include comparable store sales and non comparable store sales 
fiscal year represents a fifty three week year ended february   while fiscal years and represent fifty two week years ended january  and january  comparable store sales 
comparable store sales have been calculated based upon stores that were open at least months as of the end of the reporting period and include stores that were relocated or remodeled 
we also review the average sale per transaction and comparable store transactions 
comparable store sales are an important indicator of current operating performance  with higher comparable store sales helping us to leverage our fixed expenses and positively impacting our operating results 
gross profit 
gross profit is equal to our net sales minus cost of sales  plus license fee income generated from sales of footwear and maternity apparel in our leased departments 
cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise  inbound freight to our distribution center  inventory shrinkage and inventory write downs 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our net sales 
our gross profit may not be 
table of contents comparable to other retailers  as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales while others  like us  exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales and include those costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross margin is evaluated in terms of initial markup and the amount of markdowns  with higher initial markup and lower markdowns positively impacting our operating results 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of sales 
these expenses include payroll and other expenses related to operations at our corporate office  store expenses  occupancy costs  certain distribution and warehousing costs  depreciation and amortization and advertising expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is generally higher in lower sales volume periods and lower in higher sales volume periods 
our ability to manage store level and certain other operating expenses directly impacts our operating results 
overview net income for fiscal year was million as compared to net income of million for fiscal year the decrease in net income for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales  a basis point decrease in gross profit margin and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher net sales attributable to new stores 
below are highlights of our financial results for fiscal year net sales increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year higher net sales were primarily driven by an increase in non comparable store sales due to the addition of nine new stores during fiscal year and the six new stores opened in fiscal year and sales for the rd week of fiscal of million 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year measured using the weeks ended january  compared to fifty two week fiscal year  which followed a comparable store sales increase of in fiscal year gross profit margin decreased basis points in fiscal year as compared to the prior year as a result of higher markdowns and higher inventory shrinkage  partially offset by a higher initial mark up 
the bps decrease in gross profit margin followed a basis point improvement in fiscal year and a basis point increase in fiscal year higher selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to the expansion in our store base  as nine stores were opened during fiscal year

a disproportionate amount of our sales and net income are realized during the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday selling season 
in fiscal years  and  respectively   and 
table of contents of our net sales were generated in the fourth quarter 
operating cash flows are typically higher in the fourth fiscal quarter due to inventory related working capital requirements in the third fiscal quarter 
based on results from to  approximately of comparable store sales and more than of the net income was realized in the fourth quarter  making up for a net loss historically incurred through the first nine months

interest is payable on borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility monthly at a rate equal to libor or the base rate  plus an applicable margin which ranges from to set quarterly dependent upon the seasonal or non seasonal period and average net availability under the revolving line of credit facility during the previous quarter  as selected by management 
an unused line fee is payable quarterly in an amount equal to of the sum of the average daily unused revolving commitment plus the average daily unused letter of credit commitment 
a customary fee is also payable to the administrative agent under the loan agreement on an annual basis 
the availability of the revolving line of credit facility is subject to a borrowing base  which is comprised of eligible credit card receivables and the liquidation value of eligible landed inventory  eligible distribution center inventory and eligible in transit inventory 
the company paid off the remaining obligation on the million equipment loan in fiscal the amended loan agreement allows us to obtain up to a million equipment term loan 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility are secured by the company s inventory  accounts receivable and all other personal property  except as specifically excluded in the agreement 
among other provisions  the revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial covenants restricting the amount of capital expenditures and dividends that can be paid without consent from the lenders 
as of february   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
the loan  guaranty and security agreement relating to the company s revolving line of credit facility includes a negative covenant that restricts dividends and other upstream distributions by the company and its subsidiaries to the extent the company does not meet minimum excess availability thresholds 
exceptions to this covenant 
table of contents include dividends or other upstream distributions i by subsidiaries of gordmans  inc to gordmans  inc 
and its other subsidiaries  ii that consist of repurchases of stock of employees in an amount not to exceed  in any fiscal year  iii to the company to pay federal  provincial  state and local income taxes and franchise taxes solely arising out of the consolidated operations of the company and its subsidiaries  iv to the company to pay certain reasonable directors fees and out of pocket expenses  reasonable and customary indemnities to directors  officers and employees and other expenses in connection with the ordinary corporate governance  overhead  legal and accounting and maintenance and v additional distributions and dividends in an aggregate amount not to exceed  during the term of the facility 
the loan  guaranty and security agreement also includes a negative covenant that restricts subsidiaries of the company from making any loans to the company 
we also entered into two financing arrangements to purchase software during fiscal during fiscal year  the company paid off the remaining obligation of million outstanding at january  on these arrangements 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as noted in the table below  the company has contractual obligations and commitments as of february  that may affect the financial condition of the company 
however  management believes that there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
other than the letters of credit set forth in the table below  the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of february  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of february  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in s contractual obligations capital leases operating leases revolving line of credit letters of credit total includes principal and interest payments on capital lease obligations 
certain retail store leases contain provisions for additional rent based on varying percentages of sales when sales reach certain thresholds  but are not included in operating lease obligations 
two retail stores with provisions for additional percentage rent exceeded the applicable sales thresholds in fiscal contingent rent was million in fiscal real estate taxes  common area maintenance and insurance are expenses considered additional rent that can vary from year to year  but are not included in operating lease obligations 
these expenses represented approximately of lease expense for our retail stores in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting 
table of contents principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties  which may cause actual results to differ from reported amounts 
management evaluated the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates and believes that the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are the most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position  and are therefore discussed as critical 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the policies presented below  there are other items within the company s financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical 
with respect to critical accounting policies  even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations 
more information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
license fees from licensed departments represent a percentage of total footwear and maternity sales due to the licensing of the footwear and maternity businesses to third parties 
footwear and maternity sales under these licensing arrangements are not included in net sales  but are included separately on the statement of operations 
layaway sales are deferred until the final sales transaction has been completed 
sales of gift cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of our merchandise 
the company reserves for estimated merchandise returns based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
merchandise returns are often resalable merchandise and are refunded by issuing the same payment tender as the original purchase 
income from unredeemed gift cards is recorded when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote  which has been determined to be three years from the date of issuance  based on historical redemption patterns 
we similarly record deferred revenue on our balance sheet for merchandise credits issued related to guest returns and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of the merchandise credits 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out fifo basis using the conventional retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such areas as markdowns and inventory shrinkage 
a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns 
under the retail method  permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced 
an inventory shrinkage rate is estimated for interim periods  but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end 
an inventory obsolescence reserve is estimated based on historical experience and the age of the inventory 
all inventories are in one class and are classified as finished goods 
inventories in possession of our carrier are included in merchandise inventories as legal title and risk of loss had passed 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as decisions to close a store  significant changes in the condition or utilization of assets  or significant operating losses  indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores  which involve a number of factors including historical trends  recent 
table of contents performance and general economic assumptions 
if such a review indicates that the carrying amounts of long lived assets are not recoverable  we reduce the carrying amounts of such assets to their fair values 
we have not historically experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets 
operating leases the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
for purposes of recognizing incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when we enter the space and begin the pre opening merchandising process  approximately seven weeks prior to opening the store to the public 
tenant improvement assets  as well as the corresponding tenant improvement allowances  are recorded when the amount of new store construction covered by the tenant improvement allowance exceeds the amount attributable to the landlord s owned asset  generally the building shell 
tenant improvement assets  which generally represent non structural improvements ie furniture  fixtures and equipment for which the company receives reimbursement from the landlord  are depreciated over the initial life of the lease  prior to any lease extensions 
for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays  we record a deferred rent liability in deferred rent on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the initial term of the lease as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy  we record minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases on the consolidated statements of operations 
certain leases provide for contingent rents  which are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
we record a contingent rent liability in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to health  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  industry factors and other assumptions 
although management believes adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  projections of future losses are inherently uncertain  and it is reasonably possible that estimates of these liabilities will change over the near term as circumstances develop 
share based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award for those awards that are expected to vest 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised appropriately in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the value of each stock option 
expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the common stock for a peer group of other companies within the retail industry 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time until exercise or termination and  for fiscal and grants  is estimated using the simplified method  or the average of the vesting period and the original contractual term 
in fiscal year  the expected term was based on the historical experience of similar awards 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury rate at the time of the grants for instruments of a comparable life 
the dividend yield was assumed to be in fiscal years  and  respectively 
any significant changes in these estimates used to value stock options could have a significant impact on share based compensation 

table of contents determining the fair value of our common stock prior to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock at the date of each option grant was determined by our board of directors 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the initial public offering  our board of directors used a market approach for the grants on may  and march  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in valuing our common stock in accordance with the guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which we refer to as the aicpa practice aid 
these objective and subjective factors included changes to our business plan  our operating and financial performance  our revenue growth  the lack of an active public market for our common stock  and the risks inherent in the retail industry 
in determining the fair value of our common stock at march   we used a market approach  as further described below 
the significant input assumptions used in the valuation models were based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
assumptions utilized in the market approach are our expected revenue  operating performance  and cash flows and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the current and future years  determined as of the valuation date based on our estimates  multiples of market value compared to the trailing months revenue  determined as of the valuation date  based on a group of comparable public companies we identified  and multiples of market value to expected future revenue  determined as of the valuation date  based on the same group of comparable public companies 
in determining the most appropriate comparable companies  we considered several factors  including the other companies industry  size and their specific products and services 
may  valuation in determining our enterprise value at may   we used a market approach 
significant assumptions used in the market approach included the following a multiple of times trailing twelve months ebitda 
we also applied a discount for lack of marketability of in arriving at the value of our common stock  which reflected the assessment in may that an initial public offering was very unlikely 
in determining our enterprise value at may   we used the probability weighted expected return  or pwer  method as described in the aicpa practice aid 
we determined that a strategic sale would be likely due to our shareholders historical experience of selling companies after to years of ownership 
we determined the probability of an initial public offering at that time to be unlikely  based on management s and the board of directors best estimate of the probability at that time 
this probability reflects the fact that we had not begun any discussions with underwriters regarding a potential initial public offering and our board of directors had not considered an initial public offering as a potential monetization event for our shareholders 

table of contents march  valuation in determining our enterprise value at march   we used a market approach 
significant assumptions used in the market approach included the following a multiple of to times trailing twelve months ebitda 
we did not apply a discount for lack of marketability in arriving at the value of common stock  which reflected the assessment in march that an initial public offering was very likely 
we determined that an initial public offering would be likely due to our planned timeline to complete an initial public offering by august we determined the probability of a strategic sale to be 
the increase in the march  grants from the may  value of per share to per share at march  was due primarily to the following factors in early december  our board of directors authorized us to retain investment bankers to prepare for an initial public offering 
as of march   our board of directors increased the probability of completing a successful initial public offering to due to the planned timeline to complete an initial public offering by august the market value of our comparable companies increased  thus increasing the ebitda multiples we used in our valuation  which increased our aggregate equity value and the value attributable to common stock in our valuation 
our trailing twelve months ebitda as a percentage of revenue as of may  was compared to as of march  we believe consideration by our board of directors of the factors described above was a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our common stock for those periods 
the assumptions that we have made about the fair value of our common stock represent our board of directors and management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if different assumptions were made  our calculation of the fair value of common stock and the resulting share based compensation expense could have materially differed from the amounts recognized in our financial statements 
august  valuation in connection with our initial public offering  all existing options outstanding under the stock option plan were terminated 
in exchange  each participant received the following awards under the omnibus incentive compensation plan months from the date of the option termination agreement  vested restricted stock to replace the intrinsic value of the participant s vested options under the stock option plan and unvested restricted stock to replace the intrinsic value of the participant s unvested options under the stock option plan  with the same vesting schedule as that of the existing options 
the fair value of the restricted stock was estimated based upon the initial public offering price of per share on august  and applying a discount of for the one year holding period imposed on shares granted in exchange for cancelled options 
the termination and exchange of the options did not result in any additional compensation expense 
in addition  each participant received options in an amount determined by the compensation committee of the company s board of directors  with an exercise price equal to the company s initial public offering price  subject to time vesting at a rate of per year over five years 
fiscal years and valuation subsequent to our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock at the date of each option grant  or the exercise price  is based on the current market value of our stock that is actively traded on the nasdaq global select market 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised appropriately in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

table of contents income taxes we calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified 
we file a consolidated federal tax return  generally in the third fiscal quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when we believe our deferred tax assets are not fully realizable 
we have considered taxable income in carry back periods  historical and forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires that we make judgments about future matters that are not certain  including projections of future taxable income and evaluating potential tax planning strategies 
to the extent that actual results differ from our current assumptions  the valuation allowance will increase or decrease 
in the event we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
the income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities 
income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments  including assessments of interest and or penalties 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments 
actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors  including changes in law  interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments  changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate 
related party transactions in connection with the initial public offering  the company paid an affiliate of sun capital million in transaction consulting fees and million for termination of the consulting agreement 
consequently  as of august   the company no longer has a financial obligation to sun capital under the consulting agreement 
the company incurred fees and expenses of million to sun capital under the terms of the consulting agreement during fiscal year in connection with the initial public offering  the company entered into a services agreement with sun capital to reimburse sun capital for out of pocket expenses incurred in providing consulting services to the company and provide sun capital with customary indemnification for any such services 
during fiscal years  and  the company incurred fees of thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  to sun capital under the terms of the services agreement 
recently proposed accounting pronouncements in an exposure draft issued in  the financial accounting standards board fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap for leases 
this proposed change in its current exposure draft form would create a new accounting model for both lessees and lessors and eliminates the concept of operating leases 
the lease accounting model contemplated by the proposed standard is a right of use model that assumes that each lease 
table of contents creates an asset the lessee s right to use the leased asset and a liability the future rental payment obligations which should be reflected on a lessee s balance sheet to fairly represent the lease transaction and the lessee s related financial obligations 
currently  the leases for our stores are accounted for as operating leases  with no related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
while no fixed date has been determined for the issuance of the final standard  it is generally expected that the final standard will be issued by late  with an effective date no earlier than fiscal years beginning on or after january  changes in these accounting rules or their interpretation  or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 
the proposed accounting standard  as currently drafted  would have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
this exposure draft is non cash in nature and would not impact the company s cash position 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility which bears interest at variable rates see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under our software financing arrangement bear interest at a fixed rate 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility bear interest at the base rate plus at february  with an option to bear interest at the libor interest rate plus 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility may not exceed the lesser of a calculated borrowing base or million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at february  we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings of the revolving line of credit facility 
as of february   the analysis indicated that such a movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
