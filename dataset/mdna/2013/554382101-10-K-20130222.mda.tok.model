the company has funded million of the total of million cost incurred by the joint venture as of december  inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically 
table of contents throughout the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  approximately to of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
the company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center  which places the burden of cost control on the company 
additionally  certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies in the company notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight line rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall store and freestanding store leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
property maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 

table of contents property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements years equipment and furnishings years capitalization of costs the company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment  development  renovation and improvement of properties 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
these capitalized costs include direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with the project 
indirect costs include real estate taxes  insurance and certain shared administrative costs 
in assessing the amounts of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized  allocations are made to projects based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent on each activity 
indirect costs not clearly associated with specific projects are expensed as period costs 
capitalized indirect costs are allocated to development and redevelopment activities based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
for projects with extended lease up periods  the company ends the capitalization when significant activities have ceased  which does not exceed the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the construction is substantially complete 
acquisitions the company allocates the estimated fair values of acquisitions to land  building  tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  based on their estimated fair values 
in addition  any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i leasing commissions and legal costs  which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the value of in place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases 
the remaining lease terms of below market leases may include certain below market fixed rate renewal periods 
in considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below market fixed rate lease renewal option  the company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors 
table of contents at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the center  the company relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space 
the company immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs 
asset impairment the company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include projected rental revenue  operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates 
if an impairment indicator exists  the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows  excluding interest expense 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value  as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis  with the carrying value of the related assets 
the company generally holds and operates its properties long term  which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable 
properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other than temporary 
the investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically  and as deemed necessary  for recoverability and valuation declines that are other than temporary 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity own assumptions about market participant assumptions 
level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which is typically based on an entity own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
the company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments 
when the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value  no additional disclosure is made 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
as these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the company provision of leasing arrangements at the centers  the 
table of contents related cash flows are classified as investing activities within the company consolidated statements of cash flows 
costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years results of operations many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred because of the transactions affecting the company properties described above  including those related to the acquisition properties and the development property as defined below 
for purposes of the discussion below  the company defines same centers as those centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison 
non same centers for comparison purposes include recently acquired properties acquisition properties and those centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the center development properties 
the company moves a center in and out of same centers based on whether the center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison 
accordingly  the same centers consist of all consolidated centers  excluding the acquisition properties and the development properties  for the periods of comparison 
for comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the acquisition properties include desert sky mall  the kohl store at capitola mall  superstition springs land  fashion outlets of niagara falls usa  the sdg acquisition properties  north michigan avenue  flatiron crossing  arrowhead towne center and kings plaza shopping center 
for comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the acquisition properties include desert sky mall  the kohl store at capitola mall  superstition springs land  fashion outlets of niagara falls usa and the sdg acquisition properties 
the increase in revenues and expenses of the acquisition properties from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the acquisition of the sdg acquisition properties see acquisitions and dispositions in management overview and summary

for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the development property is the fashion outlets of chicago 
for the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december   the development property is santa monica place 
the increase in revenue and expenses of the development property from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the opening of santa monica place in august unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting 
the company pro rata share of the results from these centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company considers tenant annual sales per square foot for tenants in place for a minimum of months or longer and  square feet and under for regional shopping centers  occupancy rates excluding large retail stores or anchors for the centers and releasing spreads ie a comparison of average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months 
table of contents to average base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the year based on the spaces  square feet and under to be key performance indicators of the company internal growth 
tenant sales per square foot increased from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december  occupancy rate increased from at december  to at december  releasing spreads increased for the twelve months ended december  these calculations exclude centers under development or redevelopment 
the company recent trend of retail sales growth continued during the twelve months ended december  with tenant sales per square foot and releasing spreads increasing compared to the twelve months ended december  the company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive in as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire during the year 
the company occupancy rate as of december  also increased compared to december  although certain aspects of the us economy  the retail industry as well as the company operating results have continued to improve  economic and political uncertainty remains in various parts of the world and the us economy is still experiencing weakness 
any further continuation or worsening of these adverse conditions could harm the company business  results of operations and financial condition 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues minimum and percentage rents collectively referred to as rental revenue increased by million  or  from to the increase in rental revenue is attributed to an increase of million from the acquisition properties offset in part by a decrease of million from the same centers

table of contents funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo the company uses ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  impairment write downs of real estate and write downs of investments in an affiliate where the write downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
adjusted ffo affo excludes the ffo impact of shoppingtown mall and valley view center for the years ended december  and in december  the company conveyed shoppingtown mall to the lender by a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
in july  a court appointed receiver assumed operational control of valley view center and responsibility for managing all aspects of the property 
valley view center was sold by the receiver on april   and the related non recourse mortgage loan obligation was fully extinguished on that date  resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
on may   the company conveyed prescott gateway to the lender by a deed in lieu of foreclosure and the debt was forgiven resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
affo excludes the gain on extinguishment of debt on prescott gateway for the twelve months ended december  ffo and ffo on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization  as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
the company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other reits 
the company believes that affo and affo on a diluted basis provide useful supplemental information regarding the company performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the company operating performance and allow investors to more easily compare the company results without taking into account non cash credits and charges on properties controlled by either a receiver or loan servicer 
ffo and affo on a diluted basis are measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo and affo do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap  and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the company also cautions that ffo and affo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
management compensates for the limitations of ffo and affo by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to gaap  along with this detailed discussion of ffo and affo and a reconciliation of ffo and affo and ffo and affo diluted to net income available to common stockholders 
management believes that to further understand the company performance  ffo and affo should be compared with the company reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in the company consolidated financial statements
