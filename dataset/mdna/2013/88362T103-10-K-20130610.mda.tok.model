in this annual report  we have included the consolidated financial statements of thermon group holdings  inc successor for fiscal  fiscal and the period from may  through march  and the consolidated financial statements of thermon holdings  llc predecessor for the period from april  to april  and for fiscal and fiscal concurrent with the completion of the chs transactions on april   predecessor no longer owned any interest in us  and  beginning with the period from may  through march   we have reported the consolidated financial statements of successor 
we do not anticipate that there would have been any material difference in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for fiscal  fiscal and the period from april  to april  had such statements been prepared for thermon group holdings  inc  except as it relates to purchase accounting in connection with the chs transactions 
the presentation of fiscal includes the combined results of the predecessor and successor periods 
we have presented the combination of these periods because it provides an easier to read discussion of the results of operations and provides the investor with information from which to analyze our financial results in a manner that is consistent with the way management reviews and analyzes our results of operations 
in addition  the combined results provide investors with the most meaningful comparison between our results for prior and future periods

actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
overview we are one of the largest providers of highly engineered thermal solutions for process industries 
for almost years  we have served a diverse base of thousands of customers around the world in attractive and growing markets  including energy  chemical processing and power generation 
we are a global leader and one of the few thermal solutions providers with a global footprint and a full suite of products and services required to deliver comprehensive solutions to complex projects 
we serve our customers locally through a global network of sales and service professionals and distributors in more than countries and through our four manufacturing facilities on three continents 
these global capabilities and longstanding relationships with some of the largest multinational energy  chemical processing  power and epc companies in the world have enabled us to diversify our revenue streams and opportunistically access high growth markets worldwide 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were generated outside of the united states 
revenue 
our revenues are derived from providing customers with a full suite of innovative and reliable heat tracing solutions  including electric and steam heat tracing  tubing bundles  control systems  design optimization  engineering services and installation services 
our sales are primarily to industrial customers for petroleum and chemical plants  oil and gas production facilities and power generation facilities 
demand for industrial heat tracing solutions falls into two categories i new facility construction  which we refer to as greenfield projects  and ii recurring maintenance  repair and operations and facility upgrades or expansions  which we refer to as mro ue 
greenfield construction projects often require comprehensive heat tracing solutions 
we believe that greenfield revenue consists of sales revenues by customer in excess of million annually excluding sales to resellers  and typically includes most orders for projects related to facilities that are new or that are built independent of existing facilities 
we refer to sales revenues by customer of less than million annually  which we believe are typically derived from mro ue  as mro ue revenue 
based on our experience  we believe that million in annual sales is an appropriate threshold for distinguishing between greenfield revenue and mro ue revenue 
however  we often sell our products to intermediaries or subcontract our services  accordingly  we have limited visibility into how our products or services may ultimately be used and can provide no assurance that our categorization may accurately reflect the sources of such revenue 
furthermore  our customers do not typically enter into long term forward maintenance contracts with us 
in any given year  certain of our smaller greenfield projects may generate less than million in annual sales  and certain of our larger plant expansions or upgrades may generate in excess of million in annual sales  though we believe that such exceptions are few in number and insignificant to our overall results of operations 
we believe that our pipeline of planned projects  in addition to our backlog of signed purchase orders  provides us with strong visibility into our future revenue  as historically we have experienced few order cancellations  and the cancellations that have occurred in the past have not been material compared to our total contract volume or total backlog 
the small number of order cancellations is attributable in part to the fact that a large portion of our solutions are ordered and installed toward the end of greenfield project construction 
our backlog at march  was million  as compared to million at march  the decline in backlog is mostly attributable to the completion of several large greenfield projects in fiscal and a decrease in new order volume of the same magnitude 
the timing of recognition of revenue out of backlog is not always certain  as it is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays  many of which are beyond our control such as customers delivery schedules and levels of capital and maintenance expenditures 
when delays occur  the recognition of revenue associated with the delayed project is likewise deferred 
cost of sales 
our cost of revenues includes primarily the cost of raw material items used in the manufacture of our products  cost of ancillary products that are sourced from external suppliers and construction labor cost 
additional costs of revenue include contract engineering cost directly associated to projects  direct labor cost  external sales commissions  and other costs associated with our manufacturing fabrication shops 
the other costs associated with our manufacturing fabrication shops are mainly indirect production costs  including depreciation  indirect labor costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
key raw material costs include polymers  copper  stainless steel  insulating material  and other miscellaneous parts related to products manufactured or assembled as part of our heat tracing solutions 
historically  the costs of our primary raw materials have been stable and readily available from multiple suppliers  and we have been generally successful with passing along raw material cost increases to our customers 
therefore  increases in the cost of key raw materials of our products have not generally affected our gross margins 
we cannot provide any assurance that we may be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers in the future  and if we are unable to do so  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
operating expenses 
our marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for sales  marketing  pre sales engineering and administrative personnel  as well as other sales related expenses and other costs related to research and development  insurance  professional fees  the global integrated business information system  provisions for bad debts and warranty 
key drivers affecting our results of operations 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors  including those described above under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report and those described below timing of greenfield projects 
our results of operations in recent years have been impacted by the various construction phases of large greenfield projects 
on very large projects  we are typically designated as the heat tracing provider of choice by the project owner 
we then engage with multiple contractors to address incorporating various heat tracing solutions throughout the overall project 
our largest greenfield projects may generate revenue for several quarters 
in the early stages of a greenfield project  our revenues are typically realized from the provision of engineering services 
in the middle stages  or the material requirements phase  we typically experience the greatest demand for our heat tracing cable  at which point our revenues tend to accelerate 
revenues tend to decrease gradually in the final stages of a project and are generally derived from installation services and demand for electrical panels and other miscellaneous electronic components used in the final installation of heat tracing cable  which we frequently outsource from third party manufacturers 
therefore  we typically provide a mix of products and services during each phase of a greenfield project  and our margins fluctuate accordingly 
cyclicality of end users markets 
demand for our products and services depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures of our customers and end users  in particular those in the energy  chemical processing and power generation industries  and firms that design and construct facilities for these industries 
these customers expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns 
greenfield projects  and in particular large greenfield projects ie  new facility construction projects generating in excess of million in annual sales  have been a substantial source of revenue growth in recent years  and greenfield revenues tend to be more cyclical than mro ue revenues 
in recent years we have noted particular cyclicality in capital spending for new facilities in asia  eastern europe and the middle east 
revenues derived from europe  including the middle east  accounted for and of our total revenues during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and revenues derived from the asia region accounted for and of our total revenues during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a sustained decrease in capital and maintenance spending or in new facility construction by our customers could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of product mix 
typically  both greenfield and mro ue customers require our products as well as our engineering and construction services 
the level of service and construction needs will affect the profit margin for each type of revenue 
we tend to experience lower margins from our design optimization  engineering  installation and maintenance services than we do from sales of our heating cable  tubing bundle and control system products 
we also tend to experience lower margins from our outsourced products  such as electrical switch gears and transformers  than we do from our manufactured products 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by our mix of products and services 
we estimate that greenfield and mro ue have each made the following contribution as a percentage of revenue in the periods listed fiscal year ended march  greenfield mro ue we believe that our analysis of greenfield and mro ue is an important measurement to explain the trends in our business to investors 
greenfield revenue is an indicator of both our ability to successfully compete for new contracts as well as the economic health of the industries we serve 
furthermore  greenfield revenue is an indicator of potential mro ue revenue in future years 
for mro ue orders  the sale of our manufactured products typically represents a higher proportion of the overall revenues associated with such order than the provision of our services 
greenfield projects  on the other hand  require a higher level of our services than mro ue orders  and often require us to purchase materials from third party vendors 
therefore  we typically realize higher margins from mro ue revenues than greenfield revenues 
large and growing installed base 
customers typically use the incumbent heat tracing provider for mro ue projects to avoid complications and compatibility problems associated with switching providers 
therefore  with the significant greenfield activity we have experienced in recent years  our installed base has continued to grow  and we expect that such installed base will continue to generate ongoing high margin mro ue revenues 
for fiscal  mro ue sales comprised approximately of our consolidated revenues 
seasonality of mro ue revenues 
revenues realized from mro ue orders tend to be less cyclical than greenfield projects and more consistent quarter over quarter  although mro ue revenues are impacted by seasonal factors 
mro ue revenues are typically highest during the second and third fiscal quarters  as most of our customers perform preventative maintenance prior to the winter season 
results of operations the following table sets forth data from our statements of operations and comprehensive income loss as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

this resulted in additional amortization expense  interest expense and tax expense for the period from may  through march  successor as compared to the period from april  through april  predecessor 
except for purchase accounting adjustments  the results for the two combined periods are comparable 
therefore  we believe that combining the two periods into a single period for comparative purposes gives the most clarity for the users of this financial information 
please refer to note to the table set forth in item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for fiscal included elsewhere in this annual report for a separate presentation of the results for the predecessor and successor periods in accordance with gaap 
in fiscal  there was a non cash negative impact of million to cost of sales and  consequently  gross profit due to a purchase accounting adjustment related to the chs transactions 
interest expense for fiscal of million reflected in part increased interest expense on our senior secured notes issued in connection with the chs transactions 
in addition  we recorded million in acceleration of amortized loan costs of the predecessor as well as million of amortized loan costs related to the successor 
interest expense for fiscal included million of accelerated amortized loan costs due to certain partial redemptions of our senior secured notes and million of amortized loan costs 
during fiscal  we accelerated amortized loan costs of million associated with the refinancing of our prior revolving credit facility and a partial redemption of our senior secured notes  in addition to million of scheduled amortized loan costs 
we paid fees to both the predecessor and successor owners related to the successful completion of the chs transactions 
as related party transactions  they were reported separately from other chs transactions expenses included in miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense for fiscal of million  which includes success fees to owners related to the chs transactions  consisted primarily of million of non recurring expenses related to the chs transactions  partially offset by million of income related to the reversal of our compliance reserve 
year ended march  compared to the year ended march  revenues 
revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
during fiscal  we experienced growth in both greenfield and mro ue sales 
in fiscal  we experienced higher than usual greenfield sales at approximately of total revenue 
in fiscal  greenfield sales contributed approximately to total revenue  whereas mro ue sales contributed approximately  which is more in line with our expected product mix based on historical results 
in fiscal  we experienced growth of million and million in our canada and asia regions  respectively 
we continued to see strong demand from customers in the canadian oil sands region  as well as continued growth in our mro ue business as we grow our installed base 
in asia  our growth was driven by several large greenfield jobs 
in the united states  revenue declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in the united states was attributable to a strong comparable year in fiscal when we experienced million of unexpected revenue due to freeze protection initiatives after an unusually cold winter in the southern united states 
within europe  our fiscal revenue decreased million from fiscal  which is primarily attributable to macroeconomic volatility in the region  as well as the depreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar in fiscal we expect that revenue contributed from large greenfield projects will fluctuate from period to period as construction schedules are inherently difficult to estimate 
while our percentage of revenue from mro ue during fiscal was comparable to historical averages  we expect mro ue percentage to fluctuate as large project volume increases or decreases 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is attributable to the higher mix of greenfield sales during fiscal as we typically realize higher margins from mro ue revenue 
within our greenfield sales in fiscal  we had two large projects that were competitively bid and generated comparatively lower margins which in turn reduced overall margins 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to expenses incurred during fiscal related to our ipo 
in connection with our ipo  million was paid to our former private equity sponsors to terminate our management services agreement 
additionally  we incurred million of stock compensation expense relating to the vesting of all outstanding stock options in connection with our ipo 
these decreases were offset by increases in our salaries and benefits of approximately million  which were primarily incurred to meet the needs of our growing sales and engineering operations 
excluding stock compensation and other expenses associated with our ipo  marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses were in both fiscal and amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease is attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments 
we expect fiscal and fiscal to be representative of our annual amortization expense for the foreseeable future 
interest expense  net 
interest expense and loss on redemptions of debt totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in fiscal and fiscal  we made redemptions on our senior notes totaling million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our senior secured notes outstanding resulted in an approximate decrease of million of interest expense during fiscal in connection with the senior note redemptions  we accelerated the amortization of our deferred debt issuance costs in the amounts of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  we refinanced our prior revolving credit facility and incurred million in acceleration of deferred debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  we experienced a million loss on retirement of debt related to early redemption premium payments on the senior notes 
miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease in expense of million due mostly to decreased losses on foreign exchange transactions in fiscal miscellaneous expense consisted primarily of losses on foreign exchange transactions and our use of foreign currency forward contracts which were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes 
we reported an income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million due to an increase of million of taxable income in fiscal the effective tax rates were in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
we have subsidiaries in multiple foreign locations and the statutory income tax rate in many of our foreign subsidiaries is lower than the us federal rate of 
to the extent that we expect to repatriate dividends from these subsidiaries  we are required to accrue the estimated incremental us tax in anticipation of the foreign dividends being repatriated 
the accrual for these estimated taxes results in an effective tax rate which is nearly the same as the us federal statutory rate plus state and other miscellaneous taxes 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was higher due to the permanent tax effect of items related to our ipo such as the accelerated vesting of stock options 
some of the accelerated stock options had been granted to employees in foreign jurisdictions in which there is no tax deduction for stock compensation expense 
see also note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
in connection with our ipo  during fiscal we incurred million of expenses related to the termination of our management services agreement and the acceleration of stock compensation expenses 
expenses related to our debt redemptions and refinancing of our prior revolving credit facility and the decrease in interest expense on our senior secured notes resulted in a decrease in interest expenses of million in fiscal these decreases in expenses were partially offset by an increase of million in income taxes as a result of a million increase in pre tax income in fiscal year ended march  successor compared to the year ended march  predecessor successor non gaap we have prepared our consolidated and combined financial statements as if thermon group holdings  inc successor had been in existence throughout all relevant periods 
the historical financial and other data prior to the chs transactions  which occurred on april  and which established a new basis of accounting  have been prepared using the historical results of operations and assets and liabilities of thermon holdings  llc and its subsidiaries predecessor 
our historical financial data prior to april  may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance 
for comparability to the periods discussed herein  please refer to note to the table set forth in item  selected financial data 
revenues 
revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
during fiscal  we experienced growth in both greenfield and mro ue sales 
in fiscal  we experienced higher than usual greenfield sales at approximately of total revenue 
in fiscal  greenfield sales contributed approximately to total revenue  whereas mro ue sales contributed approximately  which is more in line with our expected product mix based on historical results 
during fiscal  we continued to experience sales growth from oil and gas production and refining  especially as it relates to activity in arctic climates 
also in fiscal  we experienced approximately million in unanticipated sales due to freeze protection initiatives on existing electrical power plants located in the southern united states 
these projects were in response to power disruptions due to an unusually cold weather during the previous winter 
revenues increased in all geographies in which we operate during fiscal we experienced growth of million  million  million and million in the united states  canada  europe and asia  respectively 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  there was a non cash million negative impact to gross profit due to a purchase accounting adjustment related to the chs transactions 
under purchase accounting rules  inventories that were carried at lower of cost or fair value are stepped up to fair value  which eliminates gross profit in the period in which the units are sold 
excluding the purchase accounting adjustment  gross margin would have been in fiscal on an adjusted basis  profit margin was higher in fiscal this increase is attributable to the higher mix of mro ue sales during the year as mro ue revenue generally provides us with higher gross margins 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is mostly attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits of million to support our growing business 
of this amount  we had a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the acceleration of employee stock options at the ipo date 
during fiscal  we added additional employees to support our growing sales and engineering needs 
fiscal also reflected an increase of million in management fees paid to our former private equity sponsors over fiscal management fee expense of million during fiscal included a payment of million in connection with the termination of the management services agreement at the time of the ipo 
as a percentage of revenues  marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the management fees  that will no longer be recurring  marketing  general and administrative and engineering would have been of revenue 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
we expect that fiscal is more representative of our estimated expense for amortization of intangible assets for the foreseeable future 
amortization of intangible assets was higher in fiscal because it included the amortization of estimated backlog that was expensed over five months  which was the estimated life for that intangible asset generated by the chs transactions 
the amortization related to backlog accounted for the entire million difference between the comparative periods 
interest expense  net 
interest expense and loss on debt redemptions totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in fiscal  we made redemptions on our senior notes totaling million and in fiscal  our predecessor repaid million of debt in connection with the completion of the chs transactions which occurred april  as a result of these repayments  deferred debt cost acceleration and other prepayment costs totaled million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest expense on our senior secured notes was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease in expense of million 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of a million loss on foreign exchange transactions 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of million in fees and expenses related to the chs transactions 
we did not incur any chs transaction expenses in fiscal income taxes 
we reported an income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to an million tax benefit in fiscal  an increase of million 
the effective tax rates were in fiscal and a benefit rate of in fiscal we have subsidiaries in multiple foreign locations and the statutory income tax rate in many of our foreign subsidiaries is lower than the us federal rate of 
to the extent that we expect to repatriate dividends from these subsidiaries  we are required to accrue the estimated incremental us tax in anticipation of the foreign dividends being repatriated 
the accrual for these estimated taxes results in an effective tax rate which is nearly the same as the us federal statutory rate plus state and other miscellaneous taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by the chs transactions 
permanent items recorded in fiscal included non deductible portions of the chs transactions costs as well a recorded valuation allowance on foreign tax carry forwards 
net income loss 
net income was million in fiscal  as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to increased gross profit in fiscal of million 
increased net income was also impacted by the elimination or reduction of expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with the chs transactions 
these included the transaction fees and expenses of million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of million 
in addition  interest expense decreased by million as compared to fiscal due to decreased levels of indebtedness 
in total  the increase in gross profit and the decreases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense and transaction costs related to the chs transactions contributed million in positive impacts to fiscal net income 
these were offset in fiscal by increased marketing  general  and administrative expenses of million and income tax expense of million and other increased miscellaneous expense after excluding the chs transactions expense in fiscal of million 
contractual obligations and contingencies contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual payment obligations as of march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity position assuming all obligations reach maturity 
payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands senior secured notes interest payments on senior secured notes operating lease obligations obligations in settlement of the chs transaction raw material supply agreement information technology services agreements total our senior secured notes  scheduled to mature on may   accrue interest at a fixed rate of 
we redeemed these notes on may  we have presented the obligation as though they were outstanding to maturity 
subsequent to march   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to which we borrowed million under a variable rate term loan and used the proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding senior secured notes and pay associated make whole premiums to the respective noteholders 
see note  subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
our operating leases include the leases on certain of our manufacturing and warehouse facilities 
consists of estimated amounts owed to sellers in the chs transactions for restricted cash and in satisfaction of the post closing adjustment for estimated income tax refunds 
represents the future committed supply purchases of nickel alloy tubing  a raw material used in our manufacturing process 
we are committed to take delivery of a minimum of pieces of nickel alloy tubing monthly over a one year period  at a fixed price 
represents the future annual service fees associated with certain information technology service agreements with several vendors 
contingencies 
we are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings and disputes that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
some of these proceedings may result in fines  penalties or judgments being assessed against us  which  from time to time  may adversely affect our financial results 
for a discussion of contingencies that may adversely affect our results of operations  see note  commitments and contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we have considered these proceedings and disputes in determining the necessity of any reserves for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable 
our recorded reserves are based on estimates developed with consideration given to the potential merits of claims or quantification of any performance obligations 
in doing so  we take into account our history of claims  the limitations of any insurance coverage  advice from outside counsel  the possible range of outcomes to such claims and obligations and their associated financial impact if known and reasonably estimable  and management strategy with regard to the settlement or defense of such claims and obligations 
while the ultimate outcome of those claims  lawsuits or performance obligations cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe  based on our understanding of the facts of these claims and performance obligations  that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts where required 
in addition  we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings would have a significant adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to our results or cash flows in any one accounting period 
on june   we received notice from the canada revenue agency  which we refer to as the agency  advising us that they disagree with the tax treatment we proposed with respect to certain asset transfers that were completed in august by our predecessor owners 
during fiscal  we were informed by the agency that their initial audit was concluded but they intended to make an assessment under canada general anti avoidance rule 
under this rule  the agency may assess a withholding tax on dividends deemed to have been made on loans made to our canadian subsidiary during such assessment may exceed million plus penalties and interest 
at march   we have not recorded a tax liability reserve due for this matter with the agency as we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain our tax position 
while we will vigorously contest this ruling  we expect that any liability  if any  will be covered under an indemnity agreement with the predecessor owners 
other than the items noted above  there are no other gains or losses or litigation settlements that are not provided for in the accounts 
to bid on or secure certain contracts  we are required at times to provide a performance guaranty to our customers in the form of a surety bond  standby letter of credit or foreign bank guaranty 
on march   we had in place standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and performance bonds totaling million to back our various customer contracts 
our indian subsidiary also has million in customs bonds outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under our new revolving credit facility and other revolving lines of credit 
our primary liquidity needs are to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service needs 
on may   we completed a million redemption of all of our outstanding senior secured notes 
in connection with the redemption  we entered into a five year million variable rate term loan 
based on the variable interest rate of at the time of borrowing on may   we expect our annual interest expense to decrease by approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents at various financial institutions located in many countries throughout the world 
approximately million  or  of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various institutions and approximately million  or  of these amounts were held in accounts outside of the united states with various financial institutions 
revolving credit facility  senior secured notes and refinancing under a term loan 
revolving credit facility 
on august   thermon industries  inc and thermon canada inc terminated their existing revolving credit facility  and entered into a credit facility agreement with a new syndicate of lenders led by jp morgan chase bank  na as administrative agent 
as a result of the termination  we accelerated the remaining million of unamortized deferred debt costs associated with the previous revolving credit facility  which is included as interest expense 
under our august revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our prior revolving credit facility  we had availability of up to million of aggregate loans  of which up to million was available to our canadian subsidiary  subject to borrowing base availability 
at march   million of capacity was available under our prior revolving credit facility 
on april   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders in the united states and canada with jp morgan chase bank  na continuing to serve as lead administrative agent  which provided for a i a five year million senior secured term loan facility and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility which we refer to collectively as our new credit facility 
on may   we borrowed million under a five year term loan under our new credit facility 
proceeds from the term loan were used to redeem our outstanding senior secured notes  see senior secured notes and refinancing under a term loan below 
under our new credit facility in no case shall availability exceed commitments thereunder 
in addition to our new credit facility  we have various short term revolving lines of credit available to us at our foreign affiliates 
at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
had there been any outstanding borrowings thereunder  the interest rate would have been approximately 
the new credit facility will mature in april any borrowings on our new credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either i a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of a jpmorgan chase bank prime rate in new york city  b the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of and c the adjusted libor rate for a one month interest period on such day plus  in each case plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage ratio  or ii the libor rate  plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage ratio 
borrowings denominated in canadian dollars under the canadian facility bear interest at our option  at a rate equal to either i a base rate determined by reference to the greater of a jpmorgan chase bank  toronto branch prime rate and b the sum of x the yearly interest rate to which the one month canadian deposit offered rate is equivalent plus y  in each case plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage ratio  or ii a canadian deposit offered rate determined by the sum of a the annual rate of interest determined with reference to the arithmetic average of the discount rate quotations of all institutions listed in respect of the relevant period for canadian dollar denominated bankers acceptances plus b per annum  plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage ratio 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under our new credit facility  we are currently required to pay a per annum commitment fee to the lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder  which commitment fee could change based on our leverage ratio  and letter of credit fees equal to the libor margin or the canadian deposit offered rate  as applicable  on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit  in addition to a annual fronting fee 
senior secured notes and refinancing under a term loan 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the chs transactions in which we issued senior secured notes 
as of march   we had million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior secured notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of or approximately million annually 
on may   we borrowed million under a new variable rate term loan to redeem all of our outstanding senior secured notes and pay million in call premiums 
the variable rate term loan used to finance the redemption bears interest at the libor rate plus an applicable margin dictated by our leverage ratio 
at the time of borrowing  the interest rate was 
as a result of this refinancing our annual estimated interest expense is expected to be approximately million reflecting an annual expected reduction of million after accounting for the call premiums  which will be expensed in fiscal the term loan includes quarterly principal reduction payments beginning june  which in the aggregate total million over the five year term  with the remaining million due in april guarantees  security 
the obligations under our new credit facility are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  including thermon industries  inc  us borrower under our new credit facility 
the obligations under our new credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets  subject to certain exceptions  permitted liens and encumbrances reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent under our new credit facility 
restrictive covenants 
the new credit facility contains various restrictive covenants that include restrictions or limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock unless certain financial tests are satisfied  pay dividends  redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments  make certain investments or acquisitions  issue stock of subsidiaries  grant or permit certain liens on our assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets  incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain of our subsidiaries  transfer or sell assets  including capital stock of our subsidiaries  and change the business we conduct 
however  all of these covenants are subject to exceptions 
repatriation considerations 
a substantial portion of our cash flows are generated by our non us subsidiaries 
in general  when an entity in a foreign jurisdiction repatriates cash to the united states  the amount of such cash is treated as a dividend taxable at current us tax rates 
accordingly  upon the distribution of cash to us from our non us subsidiaries  we will be subject to non us income taxes 
although foreign tax credits may be available to reduce the amount of the additional tax liability  these credits may be limited based on our tax attributes 
since the issuance of our senior secured notes on april   we have been able to meet our regular debt service obligations through cash generated through our us operations  and it is our expectation that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
we did  however  repatriate million and million in fiscal and  respectively  in the form of incremental dividends from our non us subsidiaries in order to complete optional partial redemptions of our outstanding senior secured notes 
through march   we expected to make further repatriations of our foreign earnings 
accordingly  we accrued the estimated incremental taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to repatriate as dividends 
the accrual for these estimated tax resulted in an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  which is nearly the same as the us federal statutory rate  plus state and other miscellaneous taxes 
see also note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to legal  contractual or other restrictions and other business considerations 
see item a  risk factors risks related to our business and industry a significant portion of our business is conducted through foreign subsidiaries and our failure to generate sufficient cash flow from these subsidiaries  or otherwise repatriate or receive cash from these subsidiaries  could result in our inability to repay our indebtedness 
future capital requirements 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our new credit facility  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness  including our new credit facility borrowings  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  such as a change of control  we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  our new credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures  of which million was incurred for upgrades and enhancements to our manufacturing facilities and equipment in san marcos  texas and million was incurred for the development of a new heat tracing design software solution 
the remaining million represents our annual expected investments in furniture and fixture replacements  and minor maintenance 
going forward  we expect to invest approximately million in fiscal  including million of investments to replace or extend the lives of plant and equipment  million to enhance our proprietary software solutions  and million to build a new warehouse in europe and the remainder to address general capital maintenance needs 
year ended march  compared to the year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
our net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
in fiscal  increases in accounts receivable resulted in a use of cash of million compared to a use of cash of million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
in fiscal  our inventories declined and thereby generated cash of million compared to fiscal when our inventory grew in preparation for a temporary shutdown as we moved into our new manufacturing facility 
improvement in our accounts receivable are attributed to the timing and collection of our billings 
our accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal were a source of cash of million compared to a use of cash of million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to expenditures to improve our manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal  we incurred million of expenses for our new manufacturing facility  where in fiscal we only invested million on facility enhancements as we completed the project 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million used in financing activities for fiscal in fiscal  we received net proceeds on our ipo of million 
from a combination of ipo proceeds and cash on hand  we redeemed million in aggregate principal of our senior secured notes for a use of cash totaling million including cash premiums paid 
in fiscal  redemption and premiums paid on redemption of our senior secured notes were a use of cash of million 
stock option exercises and our associated tax benefit were a source of cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year ended march  successor compared to the year ended march  predecessor successor combined non gaap net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for the combined periods in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in fiscal  our operations improved from a loss of million in fiscal to net income of million in fiscal while this improvement amounted to an increase to cash flows of million  the overall decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to the reduction of liabilities during fiscal during fiscal  our cash flow from operations reflected the increase in accounts payable  interest payable  customer prepayments and taxes payable that totaled million 
in fiscal  these same liabilities  as a group  decreased and therefore reflect a use of cash of million 
this change is mostly due to the reduction in taxes payable of million 
with the additional debt from the chs transactions  fiscal reflected an million increase in interest payable 
in total the change in liabilities as presented in our cash flow from operations amounted to a decrease of million 
during fiscal  our receivables grew due to higher sales and our inventory increased as we maintained higher stock levels for higher demand 
the change from all current assets resulted in a decrease in cash flows from operations of million 
also  the change in non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock compensation expense and deferred taxes resulted in an increase in cash flow from operations of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the significant increase in cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal was attributable to the million purchase price in the chs transactions 
subsequent to the transaction date on april   we paid million in partial settlement of obligations related to the chs transactions 
payment of the million that is estimated to be due to the former shareholders will be reported as additional cash consideration paid for the chs transactions  in future periods 
investing activities in fiscal also consisted of million of capital expenditures 
this included a million investment in a new manufacturing facility on our san marcos  texas campus 
investing activities in fiscal consisted of million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in provided by financing activities totaled million used in fiscal  compared to million provided by financing activities for fiscal in fiscal  we received net proceeds from our ipo of million 
from a combination of ipo proceeds and cash on hand  we redeemed million in aggregate principal of our senior secured notes for a use of cash totaling million including cash premiums paid 
financing activities in fiscal consisted of proceeds from the issuance of million under the senior secured notes and million received from equity investments in us offset by million used for the payment of deferred debt costs 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purposes entities and other structured finance entities 
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs  such as wages  have an impact on our operating results  inflation has had minimal net impact on our operating results during the last three years  as overall inflation has been offset by increased selling prices and cost reduction actions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future 
seasonality our quarterly revenues are impacted by the level of large greenfield projects that may be occurring at any given time 
demand for our products depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers and end users  in particular those customers in the oil and gas  refining  and chemical processing markets 
these customers expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns 
our operating expenses remain relatively consistent with some variability related to overall headcount of the company which increased during fiscal our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on the cyclical pattern of industries to which we provide heat tracing solutions and the seasonality of mro ue demand for our products 
most of our customers perform preventative maintenance prior to the winter season  thus in our experience making the months of october and november typically our largest for mro ue revenue 
however  revenues from greenfield projects are not seasonal and tend to be level throughout the year  depending on the capital spending environment 
overall  seasonality does not have a material effect on our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
our most significant financial statement estimates include revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  warranty reserves  inventory reserves and potential litigation claims and settlements 
although these estimates are based on management best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be materially different from the estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
on average  less than of our annual revenues are derived from the installation of heat tracing solutions for which we apply construction type accounting 
these construction related contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
most of our construction contract revenue is recognized using either the percentage of completion method  based on the percentage that actual costs to date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract or as it relates to cost reimbursable projects  revenue is recognized as work is performed 
we follow the guidance of fasb asc revenue recognition topic for accounting policies relating to our use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs and revenue recognition  including the recognition of profit incentives  unapproved change orders and claims and combining and segmenting contracts 
we utilize the cost to cost approach to measure the extent of progress toward completion  as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress 
under the cost to cost approach  the use of total estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts 
significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering  materials  components  equipment  labor and subcontracts  labor productivity  schedule durations  including subcontract and supplier progress  liquidated damages  contract disputes  including claims  achievement of contractual performance requirements  and contingency  among others 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates as contracts progress is reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including the recognition of any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in our construction contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our historical construction contract cost estimates have generally been accurate  and management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or the methodology used to calculate these estimates 
sales which are not accounted for under asc may have multiple elements  including heat tracing product  engineering and field services such as inspection  repair and or training 
we assess such revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting 
each deliverable provided under multiple element arrangements is considered a separate unit of accounting 
revenues associated with the sale of a product are recognized upon delivery  while the revenue for engineering and field services are recognized as services are rendered  limited to the amount of consideration which is not contingent upon the successful provision of future products or services under the arrangement 
amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
estimating allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company receivables are recorded at cost when earned and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash 
the carrying value of the company receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  represents their estimated net realizable value 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate specific receivable balances may be impaired  further consideration is given to the company ability to collect those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of aged receivables 
past due receivable balances are written off when the company internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amounts due 
the company primary base of customers operates in the oil  chemical processing and power generation industries 
although the company has a concentration of credit risk within these industries  the company has not experienced significant collection losses on sales to these customers 
the company foreign receivables are not concentrated within any one geographic region nor are they subject to any current economic conditions that would subject the company to unusual risk 
the company does not generally require collateral or other security from customers 
we perform credit evaluations of new customers and sometimes require deposits  prepayments or use of trade letters of credit to mitigate our credit risk 
allowance for doubtful account balances are million and million as of march  and  respectively 
although we have fully provided for these balances  we continue to pursue collection of these receivables 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated fair market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
fair market value is determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual products and components to historical usage rates  current backlog and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age and potential applications of inventory  in order to identify specific products and components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold 
our finished goods inventory consists primarily of completed electrical cable that has been manufactured for various heat tracing solutions 
most of our manufactured product offerings are built to industry standard specifications that have general purpose applications and therefore are sold to a variety of customers in various industries 
some of our products  such as custom orders and ancillary components outsourced from third party manufacturers  have more specific applications and therefore may be at a higher risk of inventory obsolescence 
inventory is written off in the period in which the disposal occurs 
actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand  customer negotiations  product application  technology shifts and other factors 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million at both march  and historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess cost adjustments have been within our expectations  and management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the inventory valuation reserves 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances 
if our assumptions used to calculate these allowances do not agree with our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  actual demand for our inventory  or the number of products and installations returned under warranty  additional provisions may be needed and our future results of operations could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
we operate as a single reportable segment with four geographic reporting units  each of which are assessed 
we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
some of the impairment indicators we consider include significant differences between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of our assets and liabilities  macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic condition or limitations on accessing capital  industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which we operate and an increased competitive environment  cost factors such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  other relevant events such as litigation  changes in management  key personnel  strategy or customers  the testing for recoverability of our long lived assets and a potential decrease in share price 
we evaluate the significance of identified events and circumstances on the basis of the weight of evidence along with how they could affect the relationship between the reporting unit fair value and carrying amount  including positive mitigating events and circumstances 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount  then a second step is performed to quantify the amount of goodwill impairment 
if impairment is indicated  a goodwill impairment charge is recorded to write the goodwill down to its implied fair value 
the company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed during fiscal and fiscal other intangible assets include indefinite lived intangible assets for which we must also perform an annual test of impairment 
the company indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks 
the fair value of the company trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves first estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trademark  then applying these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine the fair value 
the royalty rate is estimated using both a market and income approach 
the market approach relies on the existence of identifiable transactions in the marketplace involving the licensing of trademarks similar to those owned by the company 
the income approach uses a projected pretax profitability rate relevant to the licensed income stream 
we believe the use of multiple valuation techniques results in a more accurate indicator of the fair value of each trademark 
this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark 
the results of this test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year indicated that there was no impairment of our indefinite life intangible assets during fiscal or accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to asc  income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  judicial rulings  refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
as of march   we expect to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the extent that a foreign subsidiary generates earnings in excess of its working capital or other investment requirements 
if available  such earnings may be monetized in the form of dividends to the us parent 
accordingly  we have accrued the estimated incremental tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to repatriate as dividends 
in developing our estimate of foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated  we consider the required levels of working capital at each subsidiary and accrue a deferred tax liability for the earnings and profits in excess of those requirements 
we consider our original investment and our working capital portion of retained earnings at each of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
the deferred tax liability recorded on the us financial statements is subject to fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates each year 
loss contingencies 
we accrue for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
we periodically evaluate available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for share based payments to employees in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income based on their fair values 
as required by asc  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments that are expected to vest 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the differences in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 
we are also required to determine the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date 
for option awards that are subject to service conditions and or performance conditions  we estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model 
some of our option grants and awards included a market condition for which we used a monte carlo pricing model to establish grant date fair value 
these determinations require judgment  including estimating expected volatility 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu in february that provides entities the option of presenting information related to reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where those components are presented 
the requirements from the new asu are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  the company expects that adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements and disclosures the fasb issued an asu in december  which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position 
the guidance requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
in january  the fasb amended and clarified the scope of the disclosures to include only derivative instruments  repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions 
the provisions for this asu are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those years beginning on or after january  the company expects that the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures references in this annual report to adjusted eps  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and free cash flow per share which are non gaap financial measures as defined under the rules of the sec  are intended as supplemental measures of our financial performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
adjusted net income represents net income before certain transaction expenses and expenses related to the chs transactions  debt redemptions and refinancing of our revolving line of credit  and adjusted eps represents adjusted net income per fully diluted common share

free cash flow per share represents cash provided by operations less cash used for the purchase of property plant and equipment 
the resultant cash provided or used is then divided by the fully diluted common shares outstanding 
we believe these non gaap financial measures are meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance and are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report adjusted eps  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income or free cash flow per share

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures include the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
foreign currency risk relating to operations 
we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenue was generated by sales from our non us subsidiaries 
our non us subsidiaries generally sell their products and services in the local currency  but obtain a significant amount of their products from our facilities located in another country  primarily the united states  canada or europe 
significant changes in the relevant exchange rates could adversely affect our margins on foreign sales of products 
our non us subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  russian ruble  australian dollar  south korean won  chinese renminbi  indian rupee  mexican peso  and japanese yen 
during fiscal  we established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to asc we adjust the carrying amount of all contracts to their fair value at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are included in our results of operations for that period 
these gains and losses largely offset gains and losses resulting from settlement of payments received from our foreign operations which are settled in us dollars 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in miscellaneous expense 
the fair value is determined by quoted prices on identical forward contracts level fair value 
the balance sheet reflects unrealized gains within accounts receivable and unrealized losses within accrued liabilities 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
as of march  and  the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell us dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates consisted primarily of the canadian dollar and the euro against the us dollar 
the market risk related to the foreign currency exchange rates is measured by estimating the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates 
the rates used to perform this analysis were based on a weighted average of the market rates in effect during the relevant period 
a appreciation of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a net decrease in net income of million for fiscal conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a net increase in net income of million for fiscal a appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a net decrease in net income of million for fiscal conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a net increase in net income of million for fiscal the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal was a loss of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars  and we generate a substantial amount of our sales and earnings in other currencies  the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant decrease in the amount of those sales and earnings 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
at each balance sheet date  we translate our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency to us dollars 
the balances of our foreign equity accounts are translated at their historical value 
the difference between the current rates and the historical rates are posted to our currency translation account and reflected in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation was a loss of million in fiscal  compared to a loss of million in fiscal currency translation gains or losses are reported as part of comprehensive income or loss in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk and foreign currency risk relating to debt 
any borrowings on our new credit facility will incur interest expense that is variable in relation to the libor rate 
had there been any outstanding borrowings  at march   the interest rate on amounts outstanding on our prior revolving credit facility was 
based on our average outstanding borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility during fiscal  a one percentage point increase or decrease in our interest rate would result in a net increase or decrease  respectively  of our annual interest expense of approximately thousand 
the term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to which we borrowed million on april  is a variable rate libor based loan 
based on the outstanding borrowings thereunder at april   a change in the interest rate could result in a million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense 
commodity price risk 
we use various commodity based raw materials in our manufacturing processes 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not typically enter into long term purchase commitments with suppliers or hedging instruments to mitigate commodity price risk 
as a result  we are subject to market risks related to changes in commodity prices and supplies of key components of our products 
historically  the costs of our primary raw materials have been stable and readily available from multiple suppliers 
typically  we have been able to pass on raw material cost increases to our customers 
we cannot provide any assurance  however  that we may be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers or source sufficient amounts of key components on commercially reasonable terms or at all in the future  and if we are unable to do so  our results of operations may be adversely affected
