seasonality hotel s operations historically have been seasonal 
like most hotels in the san francisco area  the hotel generally maintains higher occupancy and room rates during the first and second quarters of its fiscal year july through december than it does in the third and fourth quarters january through june 
these seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues from the hotel 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  most notably convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service 
competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located 
the hotel is located in an area of intense competition from other hotels in the financial district and san francisco in general 
the hotel is somewhat limited by having only  square feet of meeting room space 
other hotels  with greater meeting room space  may have a competitive advantage by being able to attract larger groups and small conventions 
increased competition from new hotels  or hotels that have been recently undergone substantial renovation  could have an adverse effect on occupancy  average daily rate adr and room revenue per available room revpar and put pressure on the partnership to make additional capital improvements to the hotel to keep pace with the competition 
the hotel s target market is business travelers  leisure customers and tourists  and small to medium size groups 
since the hotel operates in an upper scale segment of the market  we also face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations  such as limited service hotels  during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates 
like other hotels  we have experienced some decrease in some higher rated corporate and business travel as many companies have cut their travel and entertainment budgets in response to economic conditions 
as a result  there could be added pressure on all hotels in the san francisco market to lower room rates in an effort to maintain occupancy levels during such periods 
our highest priority remains guest satisfaction 
we believe that enhancing the guest experience differentiates the hotel from our competition by building the most sustainable guest loyalty 
during fiscal  we completed a significant  green project that retrofits all of our guest room windows with new double pane inserts that result in greater energy savings and better sound attenuation for our guests 
we have also upgraded our common areas of the hotel and improved our restaurant facilities  food and beverage services and now provide advanced technological amenities throughout our lobby 
our guest responses to these improvements have been very positive 
the hotel also remains a leader in implementing hilton s huanying welcome program that features a tailored experience for chinese travelers 
we continue taking steps that further develop our ties with the local chinese community and the city of san francisco  representing good corporate citizenship and promoting important  new business opportunities 
moving forward  we will continue to focus on cultivating more international business  especially from china  and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business  leisure and group travel 
we will also continue in our efforts to upgrade our guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the hotel from its competition  as well as focusing on returning our food and beverage operations to profitability 
during the last twelve months  we have seen steady improvement in business and leisure travel 
if that trend in the san francisco market and the hotel industry continues  it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability 
however  like all hotels  it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment and other risk factors beyond our control  such as the effect of natural disasters 
the hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry  which could adversely impact performance 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs  including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy  due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lock outs  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and is seasonal  increases in energy costs  cost of fuel  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings  wars and other military actions  pandemics or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel  natural disasters  and adverse effects of downturns and recessionary conditions in international  national and or local economies and market conditions 
competition rental properties the ownership  operation and leasing of multifamily rental properties are highly competitive 
the company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors 
in addition  the company competes for tenants in markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
the company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies 
the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect the company s ability to lease its multifamily properties  as well as the rents it is able to charge 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings and the desirability of the company s locations 
resident leases at the company s apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
environmental matters in connection with the ownership of the hotel  the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection 
under these laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental consultants retained by the partnership or its lenders conducted updated phase i environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended june  on the hotel property 
these phase i assessments relied  in part  on phase i environmental assessments prepared in connection with the partnership s first mortgage loan obtained in july phase i assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections  facility personnel interviews  historical information and certain publicly available databases  however  phase i assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties 
although the phase i assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability  we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company believes that the hotel and its rental properties are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties 
employees as of june   the company had a total of full time employees in its corporate office 
effective july  the company entered into a client service agreement with insperity  a professional employer organization serving as an off site  full service human resource department for its corporate office 
insperity personnel management services are delivered by entering into a co employment relationship with the company s employees 
the employees and the company are not party to any collective bargaining agreement  and the company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory 
employees of justice and management of the hotel are not unionized and the company believes that their relationships with the hotel are satisfactory and consistent with the market in san francisco 
as of june   the partnership had approximately employees 
approximately of those employees were represented by one of three labor unions  and their terms of employment were determined under a collective bargaining agreement cba to which the partnership was a party 
during the year ended june   the partnership continued under an existing cba for the local hotel and restaurant employees 
as of june   the cba for local international brotherhood of teamsters has expired and is currently under renegotiation 
negotiation of collective bargaining agreements  which includes not just terms and conditions of employment but scope and coverage of employees  is a regular and expected course of business operations for the partnership 
the partnership expects and anticipates that the terms of conditions of cbas will have an impact on wage and benefit costs  operating expenses  and certain hotel operations during the life of the each cba  and incorporates these principles into its operating and budgetary practices

the company had net income from hotel operations of  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to net income of  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net income is attributable to a significant increase in operating expenses in the current period and a decrease in other revenues  partially offset by an increase in room  food and beverage and garage revenues room compared to the prior year 
the following table sets forth a more detailed presentation of hotel operations for the years ended june  and for the years ended june  hotel revenues hotel rooms food and beverage garage other operating departments total hotel revenues operating expenses excluding interest  depreciation and amortization operating income before interest  depreciation and amortization interest depreciation and amortization income from hotel operations for the fiscal year ended june   the hotel generated operating income of  before interest  depreciation and amortization  on total operating revenues of  compared to operating income of  before interest  depreciation and amortization  on total operating revenues of  for the fiscal year ended june  room revenues increased by  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the year ended june   food and beverage revenues increased by  and garage revenues increased by  while other revenues decreased by  for the same period 
despite the increase in total hotel revenues  operating income was negatively impacted by a significant increase of  in operating expenses during the current year due to several factors 
major factors for the increase in operating expenses were an increase in contractual union wages and benefits in all operating departments  a reserve established for other wage costs  higher group insurance costs and higher commissions on certain group and city wide convention business in the current year 
there was also an operating loss of approximately  in the hotel s food and beverage operations for the fiscal year ended june  compared to a loss of  for fiscal year ended june  that loss was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and increased staffing for new food operations as part of a plan to capture anticipated business from the newly constructed city college of san francisco campus next to the hotel 
that business did not materialize as city college opened with an enrollment of only of its expected capacity of  to  students per day during the week 
in addition  hurricane sandy resulted in cancellations of higher rated corporate and group business in october and november that was replaced by lower rated crew and transient business that did not utilize the hotel s food and beverage outlets or banquet and catering services 
in the prior fiscal year  the hotel also recorded a credit for property taxes in the amount of  for an over accrual of taxes related to the reassessment of the improvements of the hotel that was less than anticipated

the hotel s average daily rate average increased significantly by for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  the increase in occupancy of was due to continued increased demand for hotel rooms in san francisco and the hotel s ability to capture a greater share of those rooms within its market set 
due to that increased demand  the hotel was also able to reduce the amount of discounted internet business that it was forced to take in prior years to maintain occupancy in a very competitive market and recessionary economic conditions 
as a result  the hotel was able to achieve a revpar number that was higher than fiscal those results made it possible for justice investors to declare a limited partnership distribution in december in the total amount of  of which portsmouth received  in december  justice declared a limited partnership distribution in the aggregate amount of  of which portsmouth received  the general partners of justice will continue to monitor and review the operations and financial results of the hotel and to set the amount of any future distributions that may be appropriate based on operating results  cash flows and other factors  including establishment of reasonable reserves for debt payments and operating contingencies 
our highest priority remains guest satisfaction 
we believe that enhancing the guest experience differentiates the hotel from our competition by building the most sustainable guest loyalty 
during fiscal  we completed a significant  green project that retrofits all of our guest room windows with new double pane inserts that result in greater energy savings and better sound attenuation for our guests 
we have also upgraded our common areas of the hotel and improved our restaurant facilities  food and beverage services and now provide advanced technological amenities throughout our lobby 
our guest responses to these improvements have been very positive 
the hotel also remains a leader in implementing hilton s huanying welcome program that features a tailored experience for chinese travelers 
we continue taking steps that further develop our ties with the local chinese community and the city of san francisco  representing good corporate citizenship and promoting important  new business opportunities 
moving forward  we will continue to focus on cultivating more international business  especially from china  and capturing a greater percentage of the higher rated business  leisure and group travel 
we will also continue in our efforts to upgrade our guest rooms and facilities and explore new and innovative ways to differentiate the hotel from its competition  as well as focusing on returning our food and beverage operations to profitability 
during the last twelve months  we have seen steady improvement in business and leisure travel 
if that trend in the san francisco market and the hotel industry continues  it should translate into an increase in room revenues and profitability 
however  like all hotels  it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment and other risk factors beyond our control  such as the effect of natural disasters 
revenue from real estate operations increased to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  the increase in real estate revenues is primarily due to increased rents at our properties and a one time  storm damage insurance claim received by the company on two of its properties

in the prior comparable period  the company had a  gain on the sale of real estate which it did not have in the current period

impact of inflation hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors  not inflation  since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights 
room rates can be  and usually are  adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases 
since prism has the power and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust hotel room rates on an ongoing basis  there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation 
partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks  which may be influenced by inflation 
for the two most recent fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company income is not viewed by management as material
