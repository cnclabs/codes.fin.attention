item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk  including commodity price risk  weather risk  and interest rate risk 
the following describes the company s exposure to these risks 
commodity price risk in managing its natural gas supply portfolios  southwest has historically entered into short duration generally one year or less fixed price contracts and variable price contracts firm and spot 
southwest has experienced price volatility over the past several years and such volatility is expected to continue into and beyond 
southwest is protected financially from commodity price risk by deferred energy or purchased gas adjustment collectively pga mechanisms in each of its jurisdictions 
these mechanisms generally allow southwest to defer over or under collections of gas costs to pga balancing accounts 
with regulatory approval  southwest can either refund amounts over collected or recoup amounts under collected in future periods 
in addition to the pga mechanism  southwest utilizes volatility mitigation programs to attempt to further reduce price volatility for customers 
under these programs  southwest fixes the price of a portion currently ranging from to  depending on the jurisdiction of its natural gas portfolio using fixed price contracts and or derivative instruments fixed for floating swaps  and where available  natural gas storage 
southwest s natural gas purchasing practices are subject to prudence review by the various regulatory bodies in each jurisdiction 
pga changes affect cash flows and potentially short term borrowing requirements  but do not directly impact profit margin 
weather risk rate design is the primary mechanism available to southwest to mitigate weather risk 
all of southwest s service territories have decoupled rate structures which mitigate weather risk 
in california  cpuc regulations allow southwest to decouple operating margin from usage and offset weather risk 
in nevada  a decoupled rate structure applies to most customer classes providing stability in annual operating margin by insulating the company from the effects of lower usage including volumes associated with unusual weather 
in arizona  a full revenue decoupling mechanism  which includes a winter period monthly weather adjuster  is in place for most customer classes 
with decoupled rate structures  southwest s operating margin is limited during unusually cold weather 
however  southwest is not assured that decoupled rate structures will continue to be supported in future rate cases 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings or cash flows 
the primary interest rate risk for the company is the risk of increasing interest rates on variable rate obligations 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates 
in nevada  fluctuations in interest rates on million million prior to november of variable rate industrial development revenue bonds idrbs are tracked and recovered from ratepayers through an interest balancing account  which mitigates risk to earnings and cash flows from interest rate fluctuations on these idrbs between general rate cases 
as of december  and  southwest had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt outstanding  excluding the idrbs noted above 
assuming a constant outstanding balance in variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million
