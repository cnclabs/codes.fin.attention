all forward looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
overview costar group  inc the company or costar is the number one provider of information  analytics and marketing services to the commercial real estate industry in the us and the us based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available  have the largest research department in the industry  own and operate the leading online marketplace for commercial real estate in the us based on the number of unique visitors per month  provide more information  analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors and believe that we generate more revenues than any of our competitors

our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease  comparable sales information  tenant information  information about properties for sale  internet marketing services  analytical capabilities  information for clients websites  information about industry professionals and their business relationships  data integration and industry news 
our subsidiary  loopnet  inc loopnet  operates an online marketplace that enables property owners  landlords  and commercial real estate agents working on their behalf to list properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings

our service offerings span all commercial property types  including office  industrial  retail  land  mixed use  hospitality and multifamily 
expansion and development we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  improve existing services  integrate products and services  cross sell existing services  and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research  sales and marketing organizations 
we are also committed to supporting and improving our existing core information  analytic and marketing services 
examples of new tools and services that we are currently developing and expect to introduce to customers in the near future include upgrades to our suite of online service offerings costar property professional  costar tenant and costar comps professional 
these upgrades are expected to include improvements to the search functionality as well as improvements to the reporting capabilities of the system 
we also plan improvements to property type specific searches included as part of costar property professional 
we continue to improve our mobile application  costargo  which was launched in the us on august  and introduced in the us on november  costargo is our ipad application that integrates and provides mobile access to subscribers of our comprehensive property  tenant and comparable sales information from our suite of online service offerings costar property professional  costar tenant and costar comps professional 
planned improvements for costargo include a multifamily search function and enhanced analytic capabilities 
we are also integrating  developing and cross selling the services offered by the companies we acquired most recently  including loopnet  virtual premise  resolve technology and ppr 
our sales and marketing efforts are and will continue to be focused on cross selling and marketing our services 
after the acquisition of loopnet  we launched a sales and marketing campaign directed at cross selling costar information services to loopnet customers and loopnet marketing services to costar customers 
we have incurred increased expenses associated with this marketing and sales campaign and expect to continue to incur additional expenses for the campaign during the first quarter of in some cases  when integrating and coordinating our services and assessing industry needs  we may decide to combine  shift focus from  de emphasize  phase out  or eliminate a service that overlaps or is redundant with other services we offer 
we anticipate that these initiatives will position the company for revenue growth in and beyond 
our investments in loopnet  virtual premise  resolve technology  and ppr have increased  and may continue to increase  however our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions  due to revenue from the acquired businesses  as well as our ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities among the customers of costar and the acquired companies 
in addition  we expect to continue our efforts to integrate the combined capabilities of costar property and market level information and ppr analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology real estate investment software expertise 
we plan to continue efforts to integrate costar business with virtual premise real estate and lease management solutions 
these integration efforts include providing additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers 
in order to implement these initiatives  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  additional costs 
we also expect to continue to offer our core products and services individually 
in addition  we intend to continue to upgrade the platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us in furtherance of those initiatives  in the uk during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a consistent international platform of service offerings  consisting of costargo  our ipad application  costar property professional  costar comps professional and costar tenant 
we believe the product launch was well received and a significant marketing and sales effort is currently underway 
previously  as part of our integration efforts  in  we introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations  and in early  we launched showcase  our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals high quality internet lead generation  in the uk additionally  we have upgraded our back end research operations  fulfillment and customer relationship management crm systems to support these new uk services 
in order to implement these services in the uk  we incurred increased development costs through we expect that development expenses incurred by the international segment will decrease in in late or early  we expect to expand further internationally by offering services in toronto  canada 
we believe that our continued investments in us and international products  internationalization of our us products and integration efforts have created and will continue to build upon a platform for long term revenue growth 
we expect these investments to result in further penetration of our international subscription based information services and the successful cross selling of our services to customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings 
any future product development or expansion of services  combination and coordination of services or elimination of services could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings throughout and providing substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments or changes to our service offerings could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
loopnet acquisition on april   we completed the acquisition of loopnet  which is included within our us operating segment 
the acquisition combines the research capabilities of costar with the marketing solutions offered by loopnet 
we expect the acquisition will create efficiencies in operations and provide greater tools for the combined company customers 
to acquire loopnet  we paid stock and cash consideration with an aggregate value of approximately million as of the closing date 
we funded the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand  including the net proceeds of approximately million from an equity offering we completed in june and the proceeds of a million term loan facility available to us under a credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement  dated february   by and among costar  as borrower  costar realty information  inc costar realty  as co borrower  jpmorgan chase bank  na na morgan bank  as administrative agent  and the other lenders thereto 
the loopnet transaction was subject to customary closing conditions  including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act of the hsr act 
on april   the federal trade commission the ftc accepted a consent order in connection with the loopnet merger previously agreed to by loopnet and costar 
the consent order was subject to a day public comment period  and on august   the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 
the consent order  which is publicly available on the ftc website at www 
ftc 
gov  requires us to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes will promote competition 
for example  the consent order requires us to maintain our customary practice of selling our products separately and on a market by market basis 
it also requires us to license our products to customers who have bought our competitors products on a non discriminatory basis  which we have always done in the past 
in addition  we are required to maintain our customary licensing practices with respect to the length of our contracts  to allow customers with multi year contracts to cancel with one year advance notice  and to agree to reduce the cost of any litigation with customers by offering to arbitrate certain disputes 
we plan to continue to assess any plans for additional investments in our business in the foreseeable future 
at this time  as discussed above  we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services within our current platform 
while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  providing substantial cash flow for our business  the costs associated with our merger with loopnet and the integration of our two businesses has reduced our profitability and caused us to generate losses in the second quarter of further  our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow  which may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business 
market conditions we continue to see clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry  including falling vacancy rates and positive net absorption in the four main types of property that we track office  industrial  retail and apartments 
however  the extent and duration of continued improvement in the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown 
further  the current economic recovery has been slower than past economic recoveries 
job growth  in particular  has recovered more slowly than in past economic recoveries 
improvements in the commercial real estate industry are largely dependent upon employment trends  which drive demand for real estate space 
continuing risks related to lower than expected job growth  government fiscal challenges and uncertainty over us and global economic issues may impede the ability and willingness of clients to purchase services from us or result in reductions of services purchased 
in some cases  the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world  resulting at times in business consolidations and  in some circumstances  business failure 
if cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay increase  and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers  our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates 
we compete against many other commercial real estate information  analytics and marketing service providers for business 
if customers choose to cancel our services for cost cutting or other reasons  our revenue could decline 
financial matters our financial reporting currency is the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes  as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods 
currency exchange rate volatility may continue  which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and period to period comparisons of our consolidated operations 
we currently issue stock options and or restricted stock to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the amount and timing of the compensation expense that we record depends on the amount and types of equity grants made 
we plan to continue the use of stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock  restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
in february  the compensation committee the committee of the board of directors approved grants of restricted common stock to our executive officers that vest based on the achievement of costar performance conditions 
these awards support the committee s goals of aligning executive incentives with long term stockholder value and ensuring that executive officers have a continuing stake in the long term success of costar 
in may and december of  we granted additional shares of restricted common stock that vest based on the achievement of costar performance conditions to other employees 
these shares of performance based restricted common stock vest upon our achievement of million of cumulative ebitda over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters  and are subject to forfeiture in the event the foregoing performance condition is not met by march  we granted a total of  shares of performance based restricted common stock during the year ended december   representing a total estimated unrecognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
all of the awards were made under the costar group  inc stock incentive plan and pursuant to our standard form of restricted stock grant agreement 
the number of shares granted was based on the fair market value of costar s common stock on the grant date 
as of december   we determined that it was not probable that the performance condition would be met by the march  forfeiture date and therefore  we recorded no expense related to the performance based restricted common stock grants during however  we reassess the probability of the achievement of the performance condition at the end of each reporting period or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability as to whether or not the performance condition would be met 
if we determine at a future date that achievement of the performance condition is probable  we will record stock based compensation expense related to the performance based restricted common stock grants over the implied service period 
property developments on february   we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington  dc for million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location the dc office building 
the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda  md expired on october   therefore  we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters 
we were able to create value through our occupancy of the dc office building and on february  sold the building for aggregate consideration of million  million of which was designated to fund additional build out and planned improvements at the building 
approximately million of the million additional build out is recorded as a leasehold improvement in property and equipment 
as part of the sale  we entered into a long term lease with the buyer to lease back approximately of the office space  where our corporate headquarters is expected to remain 
during the third quarter of  we incurred approximately million of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our white marsh  maryland office with our columbia  maryland and washington  dc offices 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred approximately  of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our san francisco  california office with our loopnet office in san francisco  california 
as in the past  we expect to continue to identify new facilities and consolidate existing facilities to better accommodate the changing demands of our business and employees 
as a result  we may incur additional lease restructuring charges for the abandonment of certain lease space and the impairment of leasehold improvements 
subscription based services our subscription based information services consist primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  and focus services 
costar property professional  costar tenant  and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and through our mobile application  costargo  and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment 
focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment 
additionally we introduced costar property professional  costar comps professional  costar tenant and costargo in the uk in the fourth quarter of our subscription based services consist primarily of similar services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals 
our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription based license agreements that renew automatically  a majority of which have a term of one year 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are generally based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the twelve months ended december  and  our contract renewal rate for annual subscription based services was approximately and  respectively  and therefore our cancellation rate for those services was approximately and  respectively  for the same time periods 
our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results 
as a result  management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short term and long term performance 
our trailing twelve month contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures and or consolidations among our clients  further reductions in customer spending  or decreases in our customer base 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different acceptable assumptions would yield different results 
changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
fair value of auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
there is a three tier fair value hierarchy  which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
our level assets consist of auction rate securities ars  whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
our ars investments are not currently actively trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  credit spreads  timing and amount of contractual cash flows  liquidity risk premiums  expected holding periods and default risk of the ars 
we update the discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the assumptions used in the model and settlements of ars investments that occurred during the period 
the only significant unobservable input in the discounted cash flow model is the discount rate 
the discount rate used represents our estimate of the yield expected by a market participant from the ars investments 
the weighted average discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model based on the fair values of the ars was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
selecting another discount rate within the range used in the discounted cash flow model would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of december   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million 
the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions and or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments  which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 
stock based compensation we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fair value based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to estimate the dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the stock option 
these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors  including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and post employment termination behavior  expected future employee option exercise patterns  and the historical volatility of our stock price 
for equity instruments that vest based on performance  we assess the probability of the achievement of the performance conditions at the end of each reporting period  or more frequently based upon the occurrence of events that may change the probability as to whether or not the performance condition would be met 
if our initial estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions change  the related stock based compensation expense and timing of recognition may fluctuate from period to period based on those estimates 
if the performance conditions are not met  no stock based compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized stock based compensation expense will be reversed 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  they could have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets 
the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors  including the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we consider our operating segments  us and international  as our reporting units under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 
to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test  we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors  then we perform the two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate  growth rate and future financial performance 
assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation that in the expenses for our international reporting unit will decrease upon the completion of our initiatives to upgrade the platform of services and expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment by the end of additionally  our assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the international reporting unit reflect our expectation that revenues will increase as a result of further penetration of our international subscription based information services and the successful cross selling of our services to our customers in existing markets due to the release of our upgraded international platform and expansion of coverage of our international service offerings 
these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions  commercial real estate conditions  and the competitive environment in which we operate 
changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units fair value and potentially result in impairment charges 
such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss 
we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 
as of october   the date of our most recent impairment analysis  the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october  that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable 
to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets  we may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount or if we elect not to assess qualitative factors  then we perform the quantitative impairment test similar to the test performed on goodwill discussed above 
as of october   the date of our most recent impairment analysis  the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets substantially exceeded the carrying value 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october  that would indicate that the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share also referred to as non gaap eps 
ebitda is our net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stock based compensation expense  acquisition and integration related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stock based compensation expense  acquisition and integration related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs  settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs 
we may disclose adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 
we view ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income 
in calculating ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share  we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business 
we believe that these non gaap measures  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information  analytics and marketing services  which has included acquisitions  our net income has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition and integration related costs and restructuring costs 
adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition and integration related costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
we believe the disclosure of non gaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe the non gaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and other items  such as interest  income taxes  stock based compensation expenses  acquisition and integration related costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income or non gaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of interest expense we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of interest expense to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses  depreciation and other amortization  interest income  net  and income tax expense benefit as previously described above with respect to the calculation of ebitda 
stock based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives 
determining the fair value of the stock based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
therefore  we believe it is useful to exclude stock based compensation in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
the amount of acquisition and integration related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to the acquisition 
because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition and integration related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel 
we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of headquarters acquisition and transition related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the overlapping rent and building carrying costs  legal costs and other related costs incurred to relocate our headquarters 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing charges related to our operating cost structure

we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are purchase amortization and other related costs  stock based compensation  acquisition and integration related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income 
we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non gaap net income 
in and  we assumed a tax rate  and in  we assumed a tax rate in order to approximate our long term effective corporate tax rate 
non gaap net income per diluted share is a non gaap financial measure that represents non gaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  we paid approximately million in cash  approximately of which was paid on the closing date and the remaining of which was held in escrow for approximately days after the closing date 
the funds held in escrow were subject to the prior use of such funds to satisfy any post closing net working capital adjustments or indemnification claims made prior to the date the funds were released 
the purchase price was reduced by approximately  after taking into account post closing purchase price adjustments and this amount was paid to us from the escrow fund on march  the remaining escrowed funds were released to the former virtual premise stockholders on july  loopnet 
on april   we acquired of the outstanding stock of loopnet pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated april   as amended may  the merger agreement 
we paid approximately million in cash and approximately million in equity  for a total consideration of million 
accounting treatment 
we have applied the acquisition method to account for the virtual premise and loopnet transactions which requires that  among other things  assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price was allocated to trade names  customer base  database technology  goodwill and various other asset and liability accounts 
the acquired trade names recorded in connection with the virtual premise acquisition are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
the acquired trade names recorded in connection with the loopnet acquisition have an indefinite estimated useful life and are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on an accelerated basis related to the expected economic benefit of the intangible asset over the estimated useful life 
the acquired database technology for the acquisitions is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
goodwill for these acquisitions is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of virtual premise and loopnet have been consolidated with those of the company since the date of the acquisition 
the results of operations of virtual premise are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for the virtual premise acquisition 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further details on the virtual premise and loopnet acquisitions 
the purchase accounting for the loopnet acquisition is preliminary and is subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and debt from our term loan and revolving credit facility 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net cash paid for our april acquisition of loopnet 
changes in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as accounts receivable  accounts payable  various accrued expenses and deferred revenues  as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises  purchases and sales of short term investments and similar events 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase of approximately million from net income plus non cash items primarily due to a change in deferred taxes associated with our april acquisition of loopnet as well as the amortization of certain intangible assets of loopnet 
additionally  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities is also due to the approximately million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 
net cash used in investing activities changed by approximately million 
the million cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to million of cash used for the acquisition of loopnet on april  and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments of approximately million 
proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments included approximately million in proceeds for the sale of loopnet minority interest in xceligent 
additionally  proceeds from the sale and settlements of investments included million in proceeds from the settlement of ars 
the million cash provided by investing activities for the for the year ended december  was primarily due to cash provided from the sale of our headquarters in washington  dc of approximately million which occurred in february and did not recur in  partially offset by million of cash used for the acquisition of virtual premise on october  and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the equity offering completed in june which did not recur in  partially offset by the proceeds of million received from the term loan facility in april less payments of debt and debt issuance costs associated with the debt which did not occur in contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total and thereafter operating leases long term debt obligations purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations long term debt obligations include scheduled principal payments and exclude interest payments  which are based on a variable rate of interest as defined in the credit agreement 
amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less  or ii multi year contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us 
amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of million due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  our operating results  expansion and integration efforts  and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million 
we expect to make aggregate capital expenditures in of approximately million to million  primarily related to the build out of leased office space 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we may use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
on october   we acquired virtual premise  a software as a service saas provider of real estate and lease management solutions located in atlanta  georgia 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  we paid approximately million in cash  approximately of which was paid on the closing date and the remaining of which was held in escrow for approximately days after the closing date

prior to completion of the loopnet acquisition on april  the ftc accepted a consent order in connection with the loopnet merger previously agreed to by costar and loopnet 
the consent order was subject to a day public comment period  and on august   the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order 
the consent order  which is publicly available on the ftc website at www 
ftc 
gov  requires  among other things  that costar and loopnet divest loopnet minority interest in xceligent 
on march   costar and loopnet entered into a purchase agreement to sell loopnet interest in xceligent to dmgi 
the parties closed the sale of loopnet interest in xceligent to dmgi on may  we received million in proceeds from the sale  which reflected the fair value of the investment at the time of sale and did not result in any gain on the sale of the investment 
we funded the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand  including the net proceeds of approximately million from an equity offering we completed in june  and million in proceeds from a term loan facility pursuant to the credit agreement  dated february   by and among costar  as borrower  costar realty  as co borrower  jp morgan bank  as administrative agent  and the other lenders thereto 
we made principal payments of approximately million for the year ended december  maturities of our borrowings under the credit agreement for each of the next five years as of december  are million  million  million  million and million for the years ended december  to  respectively 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of at least to and a total leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement that does not exceed to during the first two full fiscal quarters after the closing date  to during the third and fourth full fiscal quarters after the closing date  to during the period from the fifth to the eighth full fiscal quarters after the closing date and to thereafter 
these financial covenants were effective beginning with the first full fiscal quarter commencing after the closing date which was the third quarter of the credit agreement also includes other covenants that were effective as of april   including covenants that  subject to certain exceptions  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries i to incur additional indebtedness  ii to create  incur  assume or permit to exist any liens  iii to enter into mergers  consolidations or similar transactions  iv to make investments and acquisitions  v to make certain dispositions of assets  vi to make dividends  distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness  and vii to enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement as of december  commencing with the fiscal year ending december   the credit agreement requires us to make an annual prepayment of the term loan facility equal to a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement to reduce the principal amount outstanding under its term loan facility 
the repayment percentage is when the total leverage ratio exceeds to  when the total leverage ratio is greater than to but equal to or less than to  and when the total leverage ratio is equal to or less than to 
this repayment requirement is reduced by the amount of prior voluntary prepayments during the respective fiscal year  subject to certain exceptions set forth in the credit agreement 
the excess cash flow payment  if required  is due within ten business days of the date on which the annual financial statements are delivered or required to be delivered to the lenders pursuant to the credit agreement 
for the fiscal year ended december   we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment 
in connection with obtaining the term loan facility pursuant to the credit agreement  we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs  which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method 
the debt issuance costs are comprised of approximately million in underwriting fees and approximately million primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
total interest expense for the term loan facility was approximately million for the year ended december  interest expense included amortized debt issuance costs of approximately million for the year ended december  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we are required to make interest payments on the term loan facility at a variable rate of interest and during interest periods selected by us as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of december   we had million par value of long term investments in student loan ars  which failed to settle at auctions 
the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments  the investments are not liquid in the short term 
in the event we need to immediately access these funds  we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  on january   loopnet  our wholly owned subsidiary  was sued by civix ddi  llc civix in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia for alleged infringement of us patent nos 
 and  the complaint seeks unspecified damages  attorneys fees and costs 
on february   loopnet filed an answer to civix s complaint and filed counterclaims against civix seeking  among other things  declaratory relief that the asserted patents are invalid  not infringed  and that civix committed inequitable conduct during the prosecution and re examination of the asserted patents 
on or about may   civix filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint against loopnet in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia seeking to add costar as a defendant  alleging that our products also infringe civix patents 
we filed a motion opposing civix motion  and on june   the district court denied civix motion to amend its complaint 
on june   we filed an action in the us district court for the northern district of illinois seeking a declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity against civix 
on august   the eastern district of virginia transferred civix case against loopnet to the northern district of illinois  where both cases are now pending 
on october   civix filed a separate action against loopnet in the northern district of illinois alleging infringement of us patent no 
 that case was later consolidated with civix original lawsuit against loopnet 
civix amended its complaint against costar on november  to add claims under patent no 
 as well 
at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of either case involving civix  but we intend to vigorously defend ourself against civix claims 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
this guidance requires changes in stockholders equity to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods beginning after december  this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  but did require changes to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and the addition of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permits a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to simplify how companies test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance permits a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance requires a company to present  either on the consolidated statements of operations or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this guidance is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods beginning after december  this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide information  analytics and marketing services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the us  us and france 
our functional currency for our operations in the uk and france is the local currency 
as such  fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for the year ended december   revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately of total revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the carrying amount of net assets 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have increased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a weakening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the carrying amount of net assets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all 
as of december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately million 
we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   we had million of long term debt bearing interest at a variable rate of libor plus 
if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense on our long term debt 
based on our outstanding borrowings as of december   an increase in the interest rate by basis points would result in an increase of approximately  in interest expense annually 
based on our outstanding borrowings as of december   a decrease in the interest rate by basis points would result in a decrease of approximately  in interest expense annually 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not believe that increases or decreases in interest rates will impact our ability to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
included within our long term investments are investments in mostly aaa rated student loan ars 
these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education 
as of december   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
as a result  we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful 
in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments  we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process  who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par  resulting in a loss 
based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december   we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
we have approximately million in intangible assets as of december  as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
