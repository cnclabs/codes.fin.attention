overview the company we are engaged in researching  developing  and commercializing cell based therapeutics and enabling tools and technologies for stem cell based research and drug discovery and development 
our research and development r d programs are primarily focused on identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
in particular  since we relocated our corporate headquarters to california in  our r d efforts have been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and developing this cell as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns 
our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells is currently in clinical development for several indications chronic spinal cord injury  dry age related macular degeneration amd and pelizeaus merzbacher disease pmd  which is a myelination disorder in the brain 
in october  we published in science translational medicine  a peer reviewed journal  the data from our four patient phase i clinical trial in pmd  which showed preliminary evidence of durable and progressive donor derived myelination in all four patients 
in addition  there were measurable gains in neurological function in three of the four patients  with the fourth patient clinically stable 
we are conducting a phase i ii clinical trial for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury 
this trial is being conducted in switzerland under authorization from swissmedic  and represents the first time that neural stem cells have been transplanted as a potential therapeutic agent for spinal cord injury 
in february  we announced that the first patient cohort  all of whom had complete spinal cord injuries  had completed the trial 
in addition  data from this first cohort continued to demonstrate a favorable safety profile and showed that the considerable gains in sensory function observed at the six month assessment in two of the three patients compared to pre transplant 
table of contents baselines had persisted at the month assessment  the third patient remained stable 
also  in september  the first patient with an incomplete spinal cord injury was enrolled and dosed with our hucns sc cells 
in june  we initiated a phase i ii clinical trial in dry amd  and in october  the first patient in this trial was enrolled and dosed 
we previously completed a phase i clinical trial in infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  and the data from that trial showed that our hucns sc cells were well tolerated and non tumorigenic  and that there was evidence of engraftment and long term survival of the transplanted hucns sc cells 
in july  the governing board of the california institute for regenerative medicine cirm approved our application for a disease team award for up to million to fund preclinical development of our hucns sc cells for cervical spinal cord injury  the funds would have been provided in the form of a forgivable loan 
however  in march  we elected not to borrow these funds from cirm 
in september  the governing board of cirm approved our application for a second  separate disease team award for up to million to fund preclinical development of our hucns sc cells for alzheimer s disease  this award would also be in the form of a forgivable loan 
negotiation of the terms and conditions for this loan is ongoing 
for a brief description of our significant therapeutic research and development programs see overview therapeutic product development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k 
we are also engaged in developing and commercializing applications of our technologies to enable research  which we believe represent current and nearer term commercial opportunities 
our portfolio of technologies includes cell technologies relating to embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem ips cells  and tissue derived adult stem cells  expertise and infrastructure for providing cell based assays for drug discovery  a cell culture products and antibody reagents business  and an intellectual property portfolio with claims relevant to cell processing  reprogramming and manipulation  as well as to gene targeting and insertion 
many of these enabling technologies were acquired in april as part of our acquisition of the operations of stem cell sciences plc scs 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented technologies and sales of products for use in stem cell research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing  such as from equity and debt offerings  to finance our operations 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our therapeutic product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv obtain required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 

table of contents given the early stage of development of our therapeutic product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda  swissmedic and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the research markets served by our tools and technologies products are highly competitive  complex and dynamic 
technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in biological research  and stem cell technologies have been evolving particularly fast 
we compete mainly by focusing on specialty media and antibody reagent products and human cell lines where we believe our expertise  intellectual property and reputation give us competitive advantage 
we believe that  in this particular market niche  our products and technologies offer customers specific advantages over those offered by our competitors 
we compete by offering innovative  quality controlled products  consistently made and designed to produce reproducible results 
we continue to make investments in research and development  quality management  quality improvement  and product innovation 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues from the sale of specialty cell culture products of approximately  we can give no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate such revenues in the future 
significant events therapeutic product development in january  we published preclinical data demonstrating that our proprietary hucns sc cells protect host photoreceptors and preserve vision in a well established animal model of retinal disease 
moreover  the number of cone photoreceptors  which are responsible for central vision  remained constant over an extended period 
in humans  degeneration of the core photoreceptors accounts for the unique pattern of vision loss in dry amd 
the data was featured as the cover article in the peer reviewed european journal of neuroscience 
also in january  the fda authorized the initiation of a phase i ii clinical trial of our proprietary hucns sc cells in dry amd  the most common form of amd 
amd is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over years of age  and approximately million people worldwide are afflicted with the disease 
there are no approved treatments for dry amd 
in february  the fourth and final patient in our phase i pmd trial completed the twelve month follow up and evaluations required by the trial protocol  and the trial was completed 
in april  we presented preliminary evidence of progressive and durable donor cell derived myelination in all four patients who were transplanted with our proprietary hucns sc cells in our phase i clinical trial for pmd  a rare hypomyelination disorder in children 
in addition  clinical assessment revealed small but measureable gains in motor and or cognitive function in three of the four patients  the fourth patient remained clinically stable 
the study was conducted by researchers at the university of california  san francisco ucsf 
a summary of the trial results were presented at the european leukodystrophy association ela families scientists meeting in paris  france 
in may  we presented data from the first interim safety review of our phase i ii spinal cord injury clinical trial  which indicated that the surgery  immunosuppression and the hucns sc cell transplants have been well tolerated 
the trial  which was designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of our proprietary 
table of contents hucns sc cells  represents the first time that neural stem cells have been transplanted as a potential therapeutic agent for spinal cord injury 
a summary of the data was presented at the interdependence global sci conference in vancouver  canada 
in june  we initiated our phase i ii clinical trial of our proprietary hucns sc cells in dry amd 
the trial is being conducted at the retina foundation of the southwest s rfsw in dallas  texas 
we are currently exploring additional potential clinical trial sites for this study 
in july  we presented preclinical data demonstrating that our proprietary human neural stem cells restored memory and enhanced synaptic function in two animal models relevant to alzheimer s disease 
importantly  these results did not require reduction in beta amyloid or tau  substances that accumulate in the brains of patients with alzheimer s disease and account for the pathological hallmarks of the disease 
the data was presented at the alzheimer s association international conference in vancouver  canada 
in july  the governing board of cirm approved an award to us for up to a million under the disease team therapy development award program rfa to fund preclinical development of our hucns sc cells in cervical spinal cord 
under rfa  funding would have been in the form of a forgivable loan 
however  in march  we elected not to borrow these funds from cirm 
also in july  the japan patent office granted us patent number which broadly covers the prospective isolation and enrichment of neural stem and progenitor cells using antibody selection  as well as the use of these cells to treat disorders of the central nervous system 
some of the more noteworthy claims in this patent include methods for isolating human neural stem cells  as well as compositions of matter comprising enriched neural stem cells  such as our proprietary hucns sc cells  and the use of enriched neural stem cells as a medicament for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases  acute brain injury and dysfunction of the central nervous system 
the term of this patent extends into in september  we presented interim six month data from the first patient cohort in our phase i ii clinical trial of our hucns sc cells for chronic spinal cord injury 
the first patient cohort all have no sensory or motor function below the level of injury and are considered to have complete spinal cord injuries 
the interim data continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile  and showed considerable gains in sensory function in two of the three patients compared to pre transplant baselines  the third patient remained stable 
the data was presented at the st annual scientific meeting of the international spinal cord society in london  england 
also in september  the first patient with an incomplete spinal cord injury was enrolled and dosed in our phase i ii clinical trial in chronic spinal cord injury 
patients who retain some sensory function below the level of trauma are considered to have an incomplete injury 
also in september  the governing board of cirm approved a second disease team award to us for up to million under rfa this second award is to fund preclinical development of our hucns sc cells in alzheimer s disease 
funding for this award is also expected to be in the form of a forgivable loan 
negotiation of the terms and conditions of this loan is ongoing 
in october  the first patient in our phase i ii clinical trial in dry age related macular degeneration amd was enrolled and dosed 
amd afflicts approximately million people worldwide and is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over years of age 
in october  two papers reporting clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of our proprietary hucns sc cells for a range of myelination disorders were published in science translational medicine  the peer reviewed journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
the first paper summarized the data from our phase i trial in pelizeus merzbacher disease pmd  which showed preliminary evidence of progressive and durable donor cell derived myelination in all four patients transplanted with hucns sc cells 
three of the four patients showed modest gains in neurological function  the fourth 
table of contents patient remained stable 
the second paper demonstrated that transplantation of our neural stem cells in an animal model of severe myelin deficiency results in new  functional myelin 
sophisticated analytical techniques were used to confirm that changes measured by magnetic resonance images were in fact derived from new human myelin generated by the transplanted hucns sc cells and these results supported the use of similar techniques to detect and evaluate the degree of myelination in our phase i pmd trial 
also in october  we were issued us patent number  which broadly covers purified populations of human liver cells  including our human liver engrafting cells hlec 
the hlec cells were first isolated by our researchers in the late s  and our scientists have repeatedly demonstrated the cells engraftment and robust bioactivity in vivo and that they are expandable 
while our hlec cells are purified from donated adult livers not suitable for transplant  the newly issued patent claims cells independent of tissue source  and therefore  has potential relevance to those deriving liver cells from induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cell platforms 
the term of the patent extends into in february  we announced that the first patient cohort in our phase i ii clinical trial of our proprietary hucns sc cells for chronic spinal cord injury had completed the trial  and that data from this first cohort continued to demonstrate a favorable safety profile  and showed that the considerable gains in sensory function observed at the six month assessment in two of the three patients had persisted to the month assessment 
the third patient remains stable 
in march  we acquired certain patents and patent applications from nsgene a s  a danish company 
these patents and patent applications claim a purified population of gfap nestin precursor cells in which one or more of the cells are capable of differentiating into neurons 
tools and technologies programs in march  we entered into a license agreement under which we granted genoway a worldwide  exclusive license to our internal ribosome entry site ires technology for use in the development and commercialization of genetically engineered mice 
we received an upfront license fee and could receive royalties on product sales 
in october  we launched four new sc proven human neural stem cell kits for use in neuroscience research 
each kit will contain high purity  multipotent neural stem cells derived from a different area of the human central nervous system  and will provide researchers with a reproducible and scalable serum free platform with which to perform a broad range of assays 
with these kits  researchers will now have the ability to compare and contrast the biological  functional and neural differentiation properties of human neural stem cells isolated from specific regions of the central nervous system  as well as to screen for the effects of different compounds on such cells 
also in october we partnered with a uk based biomedical company to develop and commercialize a range of cell lines and reagents to facilitate ips cell based research for regenerative medicine applications 
the first product under the partnership  an ultra primary human fibroblast cell line from which researchers can generate ips cell lines  was launched under the sc proven brand 
financing and other business related activities in  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  these sales were made under a sales agreement entered into in june and the sales agent was paid compensation equal to of gross proceeds 
the shares were offered under our shelf registration statement previously filed with  and declared effective by  the sec 
in  an aggregate of  series b warrants were exercised and we received gross proceeds of  the remaining  series b warrants expired unexercised by their terms on may  for the exercise of these warrants  we issued  shares of our common stock and  series a warrants 

table of contents in  an aggregate of  series a warrants were exercised 
for the exercise of these warrants  we issued  shares of our common stock and received gross proceeds of approximately  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with us gaap which defines how freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock should be measured and classified 
authoritative accounting guidance prescribes that only warrants issued by us under contracts that cannot be net cash settled  and are both indexed to and settled in our common stock  can be classified as equity 
as part of both our november and november financings  we issued warrants with five year terms to purchase  and  shares of our common stock at and per share  respectively 
as part of our december financing  we issued series a warrants with a five year term to purchase  shares at per share and series b warrants with a ninety trading day term to purchase  units at per unit 
each unit underlying the series b warrants consisted of one share of our common stock and one series a warrant 
in the first and second quarter of  an aggregate of  series b warrants were exercised 
for the exercise of these warrants  we issued  shares of our common stock and  series a warrants 
the remaining  series b warrants expired unexercised by their terms on may  as terms of the warrants issued in and  as well as the series a and series b warrants  do not meet the specific conditions for equity classification  we are required to classify the fair value of these warrants as a liability  with subsequent changes in fair value to be recorded as income loss due to change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants issued in the and financings is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of the series a and series b warrants is determined using a monte carlo simulation model see note  warrant liability 
the fair value is affected by changes in inputs to these models including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  the contractual term  and the risk free interest rate 
the use of a monte carlo simulation model requires input of additional assumptions including the progress of our r d programs and its affect on potential future financings 
we will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised  expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability 
the estimated fair value of our warrant liability at december   was approximately stock based compensation us gaap requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in  we estimated this amount based on historical 
table of contents experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
at the end of each reporting period we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience within separate groups of employees and adjust stock based compensation expense accordingly 
for the year ended december   employee and external services stock based compensation expense stock options  restricted stock units and k plan employer match in form of shares was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
wind down expenses rhode island in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking into account changes  if any  in each of the underlying factors 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections into time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the lease to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last ten years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be approximately for the remainder of the lease beginning on january  and ending on june  these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
due to the short time remaining on the lease period  the reserve assumes no additional tenants 
a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility for the remaining lease term in would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve  net of subtenant income  of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve in by recording an additional  as wind down expenses 
at december   the reserve including deferred rent was approximately  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets patent and license costs goodwill of approximately  at december   relates to the acquisition of scs operations 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations  and it is possible  even likely  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
we completed our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets  net were approximately  at december  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
prior to fiscal year  we capitalized certain patent costs  which are being amortized over the estimated life of the patent and would be expensed at the time such patents are deemed to have no continuing value 
since  all patent costs are expensed as incurred 
license costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the license agreement 
in  we wrote off the unamortized amount of approximately  for certain license agreements that we terminated 
in december  in part because of management s decision to focus on our therapeutic product development programs and not to allocate time and resources to the assays technology  we determined that we could not predict the future cash flows from the intangible ipr d asset related to the assays technology 
therefore  we determined that the intangible asset was impaired and wrote off the approximately  carrying value of the asset 
impairment of long lived tangible assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if property  plant  and equipment are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its estimated fair market value 
in and  we recorded a charge of approximately  and  respectively  to adjust the fair value of certain lab equipment we expect to dispose 
no such impairment was recognized during the year income taxes when accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 

table of contents we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  other than temporary impairment of our financial assets  changes in estimated fair value of our warrant liability  and increasing operating costs

operating expenses operating expense totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in versus change in versus operating expenses research development selling  general administrative wind down expenses impairment of intangible asset total operating expenses calculation is not meaningful 
research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as toxicology studies  costs associated with cell processing and process development  certain patent related costs such as licensing  facilities related costs such as depreciation  lab equipment  and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cells  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of applications to regulatory agencies to conduct clinical trials and obtaining regulatory clearance to initiate such trials  all with respect to our hucns sc cells  iii preclinical studies and development of our human liver engrafting cells  iv costs associated with cell processing and process development  and v costs associated with our clinical studies 
we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our 
table of contents proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update states that we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessment  we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then we are not required to take further action 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with previously issued standards 
under the guidance in this update  we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
we will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity under the caption unrealized gain loss on foreign currency translation
