item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report  including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we operate in three reportable business segments of the heating  ventilation  air conditioning and refrigeration hvacr industry 
our reportable segments are residential heating cooling  commercial heating cooling  and refrigeration 
for more detailed information regarding our reportable segments  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our products and services are sold through a combination of direct sales  distributors and company owned parts and supplies stores 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and significantly impacted by the weather 
warmer than normal summer temperatures generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for hvacr products and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
a substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business  with the balance comprised of new construction business 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
in recent years  pricing volatility for these commodities and related components have impacted us and the hvacr industry in general 
we seek to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts 
in  our residential heating cooling segment led our overall operational improvement with a increase in net sales and million in increased segment profit compared to the primary growth drivers for this segment can be attributed to industry growth and market share gains in our new construction and replacement businesses during the year 
our commercial heating cooling segment also performed well in with a increase in net sales  or increase when excluding a unfavorable foreign currency impact  and million in increased segment profit compared to this segment profits were up largely due to improved product profit margins that were driven by volume increases  favorable price and mix and productivity initiatives 
sales in our refrigeration segment were down compared to  or flat when excluding a unfavorable currency impact 
however  this segment profit increased million compared to from improved product profit margins that were driven primarily by favorable price and mix 
overall  our product profit margins improved due to volume increases  primarily in our residential heating cooling segment  as well as favorable commodity pricing on raw materials and other material cost savings 
we continue to manage our pricing structure by utilizing a combination of commodity hedging practices and controllable cost management practices through manufacturing  sourcing and engineering initiatives designed to reduce our product costs 
in september  the company announced the planned sale of its service experts business 
the service experts business had previously been reported within the company s service experts segment along with a commercial service business called lennox national account services nas 
beginning in the third quarter of  the service experts business was included in discontinued operations  nas was included in the company commercial heating cooling segment  and the service experts reportable segment was eliminated

in april  the company sold its hearth business to comvest investment partners iv in an all cash transaction for million in net proceeds  which excludes the transaction costs and cash transferred with the business 
the loss on sale and the operating results for the hearth business are presented as discontinued operations 
company highlights net sales increased approximately million  or  from  million in to  million in excluding the impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased 
operational income from continuing operations for was million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher volumes  higher margins from material cost savings and a reduction in restructuring costs as cost saving initiatives wind down

our sales volume was up and price and mix were flat from the comparable period 
the increase in volume was driven by our residential heating cooling and commercial heating cooling segments capturing additional replacement and new construction business 
increases in price and mix at our commercial heating cooling and refrigeration segments were largely offset by a decrease in price and mix at our residential heating cooling segments 
gross profit gross profit margins improved basis points to in compared to in improved price and mix contributed basis points to profit margin and improved commodity and non commodity material costs contributed a collective basis points over partially offsetting these increases were basis points of higher freight and distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general administrative sg a expenses increased by million in compared to  and as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased basis points from in to in the increase in sg a expenses was principally due to higher incentive compensation due to overall improved operating results in losses and other expenses  net losses and other expenses  net for and included the following in millions for the years ended december  realized losses gains on settled futures contracts foreign currency exchange losses loss gain on disposal of fixed assets net change in unrealized losses gains on unsettled futures contracts acquisition expenses special legal contingency charge other items  net losses and other expenses  net the change in realized gains and losses on settled futures contracts in was attributable to decreases in commodity prices relative to our futures contract prices

the increase in sales volumes was attributable to industry growth and market share gains in our new construction and replacement businesses during the year 
sales mix was negatively affected by the growth in the new construction business  which generally trends towards lower efficiency products 
segment profit for increased million due to million in higher sales volumes  million in material cost savings and million in favorable pricing 
partially offsetting these increases were million in unfavorable mix  million in higher sg a costs due primarily to higher incentive compensation from improved operating results in  and higher freight and distribution expenses of million due to continued investment in distribution initiatives

our price and mix were up while sales volume was down 
the decline in volume was predominantly in our residential heating cooling segment  partially offset by volume growth in our commercial heating cooling segment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales by 
excluding the favorable impacts of the kysor warren acquisition and foreign currency exchange rates  our net sales were flat compared to gross profit gross profit margins declined million  or basis points  from in to in the unfavorable impact of higher commodity costs for raw material and components contributed approximately basis points to the decline  and freight and distribution costs contributed another basis points to the decline 
price and mix were neutral to gross profit as our price increases in offset the margin declines in product mix 
additionally  the kysor warren acquisition has negatively impacted our gross profit margin by approximately basis points in due to lower margins for this business as compared to our other refrigeration businesses

this segment volumes and mix were negatively affected by consumers moving to lower efficiency unit purchases from high efficiency system replacements  driven by a significant reduction in the federal tax credits in  the availability of r refrigerant outdoor condensing units and overall economic and consumer weakness 
segment profit decreased million due to million in increased commodity costs from both raw materials and components with our component cost commodity increases partially offset by material cost savings  million in lower volumes  million in higher freight and distribution costs  million in unfavorable price and mix and million in unfavorable warranty adjustment 
a million decline in sg a expenses partially offset the decreases in segment profit 
the decline in sg a expenses was primarily due to lower variable compensation and general cost control 
commercial heating cooling the following table details our commercial heating cooling segment net sales and profit for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales our commercial heating cooling business experienced a increase in net sales in compared to primarily due to an increase in our replacement business which resulted in a increase in sales volume 
additionally  our price and mix increased in compared to mix was driven by strength in our high efficiency premier products like strategos and energence

liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds  bank lines of credit and an asset securitization arrangement 
working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle 
statement of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended  and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher income from continuing operations  an increase in accrued expenses and a reduction in working capital requirements 
the increase in accrued expenses was due primarily to higher incentive compensation as a result of improved overall operating results and the majority of the reduction in working capital in was related to a rise in accounts payable due to the timing of payments 
also  contributions to pension plans in were million compared to million in net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in were primarily investments in our distribution network  investments in systems and software to support the overall enterprise  and investments for manufacturing and sourcing excellence 
net cash used in investing activities for also included million in net proceeds from the sale of the hearth business 
net cash used in investing activities for included million used for the acquisition of the kysor warren business from the manitowoc company and million for the acquisition of a commercial services business in our commercial heating cooling segment 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities increased to million in primarily due to a reduction in net borrowings 
the net borrowings were higher in to support the kysor warren acquisition 
also  we made million more in dividend payments in compared to additionally  we used million in to acquire million shares of stock under our share repurchase plans compared to purchases of million for million shares of stock in debt position and financial leverage the following table details our lines of credit and financing arrangements as of december  in millions maximum capacity outstanding borrowings available for future borrowings short term debt foreign obligations asset securitization program total short term debt current maturities capital lease obligations long term debt capital lease obligations domestic revolving credit facility senior unsecured notes total long term debt total debt the maximum capacity under the asset securitization program asp is the lesser of million or of the net pool balance less reserves  as defined under the asp 
the available future borrowings on our domestic revolving credit facility are reduced by million in outstanding standby letters of credit 
we had an additional million in standby letters of credit with other banks 
as our peak season arrives  we typically pay down debt 
we believe our available future borrowings combined with our cash of million and future cash from operations are sufficient to fund our operations  planned capital expenditures  future contractual obligations  share repurchases  anticipated dividends and other needs in the foreseeable future 
our expected capital expenditures for are million 
also  we expect to make approximately million in contributions to our us defined benefit plan in our debt to total capital ratio decreased to at december  compared to at december  the decrease in the ratio in is due to the reduction in our net borrowings  as noted above  as well as an increase in retained earnings primarily related to higher net income  partially offset by additional share repurchases 
we evaluate our debt to capital ratio as well as our debt to ebitda ratio in order to determine the appropriate targets for share repurchases under our share repurchase programs 
our senior credit ratings were investment grade as of december  and our goal is to retain these ratings 
included in our cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  was million of cash held in foreign locations 
our cash in foreign locations is used for investing and operating activities in those locations  and we currently do not have the need or intent to repatriate those funds to the united states 
if we were to repatriate this cash  we would be required to accrue and to pay taxes in the united states for the amounts that were repatriated 
we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure adequate liquidity 
in november  we amended the receivables purchase agreement  or asset securitization program asp  increasing the maximum securitization amount from million to million and extending the term of the asp to november  also  in march  the parties involved with the asp agreed to remove lennox hearth products llc from the program 
any receivables originated by lennox hearth products llc that remained outstanding as of that date were repurchased by us 
we also periodically consider various other financing alternatives and may  from time to time  seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions  which may include accessing the capital markets 
on september   our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend on common stock from to per share effective with the october dividend payment 
dividend payments were million in compared to million in  with the increase due primarily to the timing of payments of declared dividends 
four quarterly dividends were declared in and  whereas five quarterly dividends were paid in compared to four in we also continue to increase shareholder value through our share repurchase programs 
in december  our board of directors increased the share repurchase program by million 
under the share repurchase program  we returned million to our investors through share repurchases with another million of repurchases still available under the program 
also  in december  our board of directors approved a new million share repurchase program 
we are targeting approximately million in share repurchases in under the existing share repurchase programs 
our credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage 
other covenants contained in the credit facility restrict  among other things  certain mergers  asset dispositions  guarantees  debt  liens  and affiliate transactions 
the financial covenants require us to maintain a defined consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio and a cash flow defined as ebitda minus capital expenditures to net interest expense ratio 
the required ratios under our credit facility are detailed below consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio no greater than cash flow to net interest expense ratio no less than our credit facility contains customary events of default 
these events of default include nonpayment of principal or interest  breach of covenants or other restrictions or requirements  default on certain other indebtedness or receivables securitizations cross default  and bankruptcy 
a cross default under our credit facility could occur if we fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization of at least million  or we are in default in the performance of  or compliance with any term of any other indebtedness or receivables securitization in an aggregate principal amount of at least million  or any other condition exists which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity 
each of our major debt agreements contains provisions by which a default under one agreement causes a default in the others a cross default 
if a cross default under the credit facility  our senior unsecured notes  or our asp were to occur  it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to terminate our right to borrow under our credit facility and accelerate amounts due under our credit facility except for a bankruptcy event of default  in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements 
in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade resulting from a change of control  holders of our senior unsecured notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the notes are guaranteed  on a senior unsecured basis  by each of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee payment by us of any indebtedness under our credit facility 
the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to create or incur certain liens  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into certain mergers  consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets  and transfer certain properties 
the indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least million in principal which is then accelerated  and such acceleration is not rescinded within days of the notice date 
during the third quarter of  we amended the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters 
while the same party continues to be the lessor under the lease  the amendment  among other things  replaced the debt participant and moderately increased the rent payments 
the amendment also provides for financial covenants consistent with our credit agreement and we are in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  the lease is accounted for as an operating lease 
in  we expanded our tifton  georgia manufacturing facility using the proceeds from industrial development bonds idbs 
we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the property and the issuer of the idbs  and through our lease payments fund the interest payments to investors in the idbs 
we also guaranteed the repayment of the idbs and entered into letters of credit totaling million to fund a potential repurchase of the idbs in the event investors exercised their right to tender the idbs to the trustee 
as of december  and  we recorded a long term capital lease obligation of million related to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the credit facilities and promissory notes described above  we also lease real estate and machinery and equipment pursuant to operating leases that are not capitalized on the balance sheet  including high turnover equipment such as autos and service vehicles and short lived equipment such as personal computers 
rent expense for these leases was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
refer to notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our lease commitments and rent expense 
contractual obligations summarized below are our contractual obligations as of december  and their expected impact on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total year or less years years after years total long term debt obligations estimated interest payments on debt obligations operating leases uncertain tax positions purchase obligations total contractual obligations contractual obligations related to capital leases are included as part of long term debt 
approximately million of operating lease obligations relate to discontinued operations 
the liability for uncertain tax positions includes interest and penalties 
purchase obligations consist of aluminum commitments and inventory that is part of our third party logistics programs 
the above table does not include retirement  post retirement and warranty liabilities because it is not certain when these liabilities will be funded 
however  as noted above  we expect to pay approximately million in contributions to our us defined benefit plan in for additional information regarding our contractual obligations  see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our retirement and post retirement liabilities 
fair value measurements fair value hierarchy the three level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements is defined as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value techniques general 
our valuation techniques are applied to all of the assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
where available  the fair values are based upon quoted prices in active markets 
however  if quoted prices are not available  then the fair values are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters  such as credit default swap spreads  yield curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  interest rates and benchmark securities 
for assets and liabilities with a lack of observable market activity  if any  the fair values are based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that  in our judgment  reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use 
to ensure that financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  valuation adjustments may be required to reflect either party creditworthiness and ability to pay 
where appropriate  these amounts were incorporated into our valuations as of december  and  the measurement dates 
derivatives 
derivatives are primarily valued using estimated future cash flows that are based directly on observed prices from exchange traded derivatives and  therefore  were classified as level we also take into account the counterparty creditworthiness  or our own creditworthiness  as appropriate 
an adjustment has been recorded in order to reflect the risk of credit default  but these adjustments have been insignificant to the overall value of the derivatives 
pension plan assets 
the majority of our commingled pool collective trust  mutual funds and balanced pension trusts are managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values nav per share are furnished in monthly and or quarterly statements received from the investment advisors and reflect valuations based upon their pricing policies 
we have assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments at level for mutual funds and level for commingled pool collective trusts and balance pension trusts through examination of their pricing policies and the related controls and procedures 
the fair values we report are based on the pool or trust nav per share 
the nav per share are calculated periodically daily or no less than one time per month as the aggregate value of each pool or trust underlying assets divided by the number of units owned 
market risk commodity price risk we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
fluctuations in metal commodity prices impact the value of the derivative instruments that we hold 
when metal commodity prices rise  the fair value of our futures contracts increases and conversely  when commodity prices fall  the fair value of our futures contracts decreases 
information about our exposure to market risks related to metal commodity prices and a sensitivity analysis related to our metal commodity hedges is presented below in millions notional amount pounds carrying amount and fair value of asset change in fair value from change in forward prices interest rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our revolving credit facilities  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in order to partially mitigate interest rate risk  we may use an interest rate swap hedging strategy to eliminate the variability of cash flows in our interest payments 
this strategy  when employed  allows us to fix a portion of our interest payments while also taking advantage of historically low interest rates 
as of december   no interest rate swaps were in effect 
a adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  assuming no interest rate swaps were in place  would result in an increase in pre tax interest expense of approximately million for both of the years ended december  and foreign currency exchange rate risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in exchange rates 
net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period 
during  and  net sales from outside the us represented  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on our overall operations 
for the years ended december  and  the impact to net income of a change in foreign exchange rates is estimated to be million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be goodwill and other intangible assets  product warranties  pension benefits  self insurance expense  derivative accounting  and income taxes 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in
