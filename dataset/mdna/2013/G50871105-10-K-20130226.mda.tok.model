overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients lives by identifying  developing and commercializing products that address unmet medical needs 
our strategy is to continue to create shareholder value by growing sales of the existing products in our portfolio  including by identifying new growth opportunities  acquiring additional marketed specialty products or products close to regulatory approval to leverage our existing expertise and infrastructure  and pursuing targeted development of a pipeline of post discovery specialty product candidates 
was a transformational year for our company 
in january  the businesses of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc and azur pharma were combined in a merger transaction  or the azur merger 
in june  we completed the acquisition of eusa pharma inc  or the eusa acquisition 
in connection with the eusa acquisition  we entered into a million credit agreement consisting of a million term loan  which partially financed the eusa acquisition  and a million revolving credit facility 
merger with azur pharma 
on january   the businesses of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc and azur pharma were combined in the azur merger  which was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  with jazz pharmaceuticals  inc treated as the acquiring company in the azur merger for accounting purposes 
the total acquisition consideration of million was determined based on the market value of our ordinary shares that were held by the historic azur pharma shareholders immediately following the closing of the azur merger 
accordingly  the operating results of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc are included in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in this report  whereas the operating results of azur pharma are included only since january  as part of the azur merger  a wholly owned subsidiary of azur pharma merged with and into jazz pharmaceuticals  inc  with jazz pharmaceuticals  inc

the proceeds from the term loan were used to partially finance the eusa acquisition 
our obligations are secured by substantially all of the assets of certain of our subsidiaries 
for a more detailed discussion  see liquidity and capital resources below 
sale of women s health business 
in october  we completed the sale of our women s health business  which included six products and was acquired in the azur merger  to meda pharmaceuticals inc and meda pharma  s rl  or collectively  meda  for net cash proceeds of million 
in  we made substantial progress in the execution of our strategy 
sales of our lead product  xyrem sodium oxybate oral solution  increased in compared to in addition  as a result of the eusa acquisition and azur merger  we significantly increased the number of products that we market and added products in therapeutic areas that are new to us  such as oncology and pain 
our marketed products address medical needs in the following therapeutic areas and include the following products narcolepsy xyrem sodium oxybate oral solution  the only product approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy  
table of contents oncology erwinaze asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi  called erwinase in ex us markets  a treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or all  who have developed sensitivity to e 
coli derived asparaginase  and other products  including products for oncology supportive care  pain prialt ziconotide intrathecal infusion  the only non opioid intrathecal analgesic indicated for the management of severe chronic pain for patients who are intolerant of or refractory to other treatments  and psychiatry other a portfolio of products  including fazaclo clozapine  usp ld and fazaclo hd  orally disintegrating clozapine tablets indicated for treatment resistant schizophrenia and luvox cr fluvoxamine maleate extended release capsules marketed for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder 
in addition  in february the fda approved a new drug application for versacloz tm clozapine  usp oral suspension for treatment resistant schizophrenia  which we have exclusive rights to market in the united states 
our international division  based in europe  commercializes erwinase as well as a portfolio of other products outside of the united states 
these products are primarily in the oncology  critical care and oncology supportive care therapeutic areas and include caphosol supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse  collatamp lyophilized collagen implant impregnated with the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin  fomepizole  kidrolase escherichia coli l asparaginase and xenazine tetrabenazine 
our development pipeline projects currently include line extensions for existing products  the generation of additional clinical data for existing products and clinical development of new product candidates 
these projects include two clinical trials involving erwinaze an ongoing pharmacokinetic clinical trial of the intravenous administration of erwinaze in north america  and a planned clinical trial including pharmacokinetic efficacy measures to evaluate erwinaze in adolescents and young adults with all who are hypersensitive to e 
coli derived asparaginase  which is expected to begin in the second half of in addition  we are developing two product candidates  including a phase i clinical trial in europe of asparec mpeg r crisantaspase  a pegylated recombinant erwinia asparaginase for the treatment of patients with all with e 
coli asparaginase hypersensitivity  and a phase iii clinical trial in europe of leukotac inolimomab  an anti cd monoclonal antibody for the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft vs 
host disease 
we expect that research and development expenses will be higher in compared to due to an expected increase in development activities and due to the inclusion of a full year of expense from the acquired azur pharma and eusa pharma businesses 
with the completion of the eusa acquisition and the azur merger in  we gained not only an expanded portfolio of specialty pharmaceutical products and product candidates  but also an enhanced commercial platform and a strengthened management team  adding eusa pharma s specialty commercial infrastructure in the united states and europe and its international distribution network to our existing us specialty product platform 
our international footprint now includes headquarters in dublin  ireland and multiple offices in the united states  the united kingdom and other countries in europe  with approximately employees in eleven countries 
we intend that our operations will function as an efficient platform for further growth  leveraging our commercial  medical and scientific experience to seek to maximize the potential of our existing products and expand our product portfolio through a combination of internal development  acquisition and in licensing 
in  we plan to focus on executing on our strategy 
we anticipate that we will continue to face a number of challenges and risks to our business and our ability to execute our strategy 
for example  while we now have a more diversified product portfolio than in the past  our financial results remain significantly influenced by sales of xyrem  which accounted for of our net product sales for as a result  we continue to place a high priority on seeking to maintain and increase sales of xyrem in its approved indications  while remaining focused on ensuring the safe and effective use of the product  and lifecycle management of the product including enhancing and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
our ability to maintain or increase xyrem product sales is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
in particular  there are two abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  submitted to the fda by third parties seeking to market generic versions of xyrem 
we have sued both third parties for infringement of our patents  and the litigation proceedings are ongoing 
we cannot predict the timing or outcome of these proceedings 
we expect that the approval or tentative approval of an anda resulting in the launch of a generic version of xyrem would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
in addition  we are continuing our work on various regulatory matters  including our work with the fda on updated documents that we have submitted to the fda on our xyrem risk management program 
the updated documents are intended to conform to current formatting requirements for risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  or rems  required by law  as well as to make other updates to the program and its documentation 
we cannot predict the timing of finalization  or the final terms  of our updated rems documents 
the fda may impose new requirements for certain elements that we have implemented in our xyrem risk management program  or require us to modify our current practices 
any such requirements  depending on their substance and the extent of modifications required  could make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute xyrem  make it easier for future generic competitors  and or negatively affect sales of xyrem 

table of contents the implementation of our strategy is also subject to other challenges and risks specific to our business  as well as risks and uncertainties common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry with development and commercial operations 
in addition to risks related to xyrem  other key challenges and risks that we face include risks and uncertainties related to the challenges of protecting our intellectual property rights  the need to obtain appropriate pricing and reimbursement for our products in an increasingly challenging environment due to  among other things  the attention being paid to health care cost containment and other austerity measures in the united states and worldwide  the ongoing regulation and oversight by the fda  the us drug enforcement administration  or dea  and non us regulatory agencies  including with respect to product labeling  requirements for distribution  obtaining sufficient dea quotas where needed  marketing and promotional activities  adverse event reporting and product recalls or withdrawals  the challenges of achieving and maintaining commercial success of our products  such as obtaining sustained acceptance of our products by patients  physicians and payors  our dependence on sole source suppliers to continue to meet our ongoing commercial needs  especially when our supply demands are growing  and the difficulty and uncertainty of pharmaceutical product development and the uncertainty of clinical success and regulatory approval 
all of these risks are discussed in greater detail  along with other risks  in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following discussions of our results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the women s health business 
this business has been segregated from continuing operations and reflected as a discontinued operation

xyrem product sales increased in and compared to the immediately preceding years  primarily due to higher average net selling prices in the and periods resulting from price increases that we instituted in those periods and  to a lesser extent  increases in sales volume of in both and price increases were instituted based on market analysis 
growth in sales volumes in the and periods were driven by an increase in the average number of patients on xyrem 
this increase was due primarily to a greater number of xyrem patients who refilled their xyrem prescriptions on schedule and who remained on therapy  which we believe resulted from our efforts to increase physician knowledge about xyrem and to improve patient support services 
the sales volume increase in the period was also impacted by the deployment of a dedicated xyrem sales force to increase physician awareness of narcolepsy and its diagnosis  and  more recently  by a higher number of prescriptions from new or previously infrequent physician prescribers 
sales of erwinaze erwinase since the eusa acquisition on june  were million in prialt product sales included sales of million in related to a supply agreement to provide prialt to eisai co 
limited for distribution and sale in europe 
luvox cr product sales increased in compared to due to price increases  partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 
luvox cr product sales increased in compared to  primarily due to price increases and to a lesser extent an increase in sales volume of 
in  a generic version of fazaclo ld was launched  which has had a negative impact on sales of fazaclo ld and may have a negative impact on sales of fazaclo hd in future periods 
we expect total product sales will increase in over primarily due to growth in sales of xyrem  erwinaze erwinase and prialt  partially offset by decreases in sales of other products 
royalties and contract revenues royalties and contract revenues in of million is consistent with prior year levels 
royalties and contract revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to the recognition of a million milestone payment related to sales of xyrem in europe by ucb pharma limited  or ucb  under a license agreement 
we expect royalties and contract revenues to increase slightly in as compared to primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of royalties from the acquired eusa business 
cost of product sales cost of product sales increased in compared to  primarily due to cost of product sales in relation to products acquired in the azur merger and the eusa acquisition  including acquisition accounting inventory fair value step up adjustments of million in cost of product sales increased slightly in compared to gross margins as a percentage of product sales were  and in  and  respectively 
our gross margin percentage in as compared to was lower primarily due to the effect of the purchase accounting inventory fair value step up adjustments recorded as cost of product sales and also due to the impact of our product mix in the gross margin on products acquired during is lower than the gross margins earned on our legacy products 
our gross margin percentage in as compared to was higher primarily due to increases in average selling prices 
we expect our gross margin 
table of contents percentage to increase slightly in compared to primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of acquisition accounting inventory fair value step up adjustments and also a change in product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in compared to primarily due to an increase in salary and benefit related headcount expenses including share based compensation of million driven primarily by increased headcount following the azur merger in january and the eusa acquisition in june in addition  sales and promotional expenses in increased by million compared to primarily due to the expansion of our organization  including our increased commercial presence 
transaction  integration and restructuring expenses were million higher in compared to primarily due to expenses related to the azur merger and the eusa acquisition 
in we incurred transaction and integration costs related to the azur merger only 
professional and service fees increased in by million compared to due to the continuing operations of the larger entity 
travel  facility and maintenance expenses increased in by million compared to primarily due to an increase in the number of facilities that we occupy in the united states and in europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in compared to primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses of million as a result of an increase in commercial activities  higher share based compensation expense and higher legal and professional expenses of million associated with the azur merger 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will be higher in than in due to the inclusion of a full year of expense with respect to the acquired eusa business  an increase in direct marketing spend on key products and increased headcount to support the larger  global corporate organization 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  costs related to clinical studies and outside services  and other research and development costs 
personnel expenses relate primarily to salaries  benefits and share based compensation 
clinical study and outside services costs relate primarily to clinical studies performed by clinical research organizations  materials and supplies  and other third party fees 
other research and development expenses primarily include overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
we do not track fully burdened research and development expenses on a project by project basis 
we manage our research and development expenses by identifying the research and development activities that we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on our assessment of what development activities are important to our business and have a reasonable probability of success  and by dynamically allocating resources accordingly 
we also continually review our development pipeline projects and the status of their development and  as necessary  reallocate resources among our development pipeline projects that we believe will best support the future growth of our business 
the following table provides a breakout of our research and development expenses by major categories of expense in thousands year ended december  personnel expenses clinical studies and outside services other total research and development expenses increased by million in compared to primarily due to increased clinical studies and outside services costs related to the generation of additional clinical data and the development of line extensions for existing products  and to a lesser extent  costs incurred to develop new product candidates that we acquired in the eusa acquisition and the azur merger 
personnel expenses and other research and development expenses in were consistent with prior year levels 
research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to primarily due to lower clinical studies and outside services costs  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in personnel and other expenses 
the decrease in was primarily due to our decision to discontinue the development of jpz  our then product candidate for the treatment of fibromyalgia  as well as our discontinuation of certain research activities related to two line extension projects for existing products 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties with respect to our research and development activities  including completing the development of our product candidates  and the consequences to our business  financial position and growth prospects can be found in risk factors in part i  item a of this report 

table of contents intangible asset amortization we acquired finite lived intangible assets in connection with the azur merger and the eusa acquisition that are expected to be amortized over their useful economic lives of two to years 
we recorded amortization related to these intangibles of million in  which accounted for all of the increase in the amortization expense 
during and  our intangible assets consisted primarily of developed technology related to xyrem and luvox cr 
interest expense  net interest expense increased in as compared to primarily due to a larger debt balance 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million  which bears interest at a variable interest rate that was as of december  in july  we fully repaid a term loan outstanding at that time 
interest expense decreased in compared to due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
foreign currency loss the foreign currency loss in related to the translation of foreign currency net monetary assets  including intercompany balances 
loss on extinguishment of debt in  as a result of the repayment of a term loan and the termination of a credit agreement  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  which consisted of a million non cash charge related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a debt discount  with the remainder related to a prepayment penalty and a termination fee 
the loss on extinguishment of debt in was due to the repayment of long term debt and consisted of million of prepayment premiums and fees  and a million non cash charge related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a debt discount 
income tax benefit during  we recognized an income tax benefit of million 
this tax benefit included a deferred tax benefit of million  offset by an income tax provision of million  relating to the united states  ireland and other foreign jurisdictions 
the deferred tax benefit included a benefit of million primarily attributable to the release of a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us federal and state deferred tax assets 
management determined that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be recoverable and the related valuation allowance was no longer needed based on an assessment of the relative impact of all positive and negative evidence that existed at december   including an evaluation of cumulative income in recent years  future sources of taxable income  and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business 
during and  we had operations only in the united states and made no provision for income taxes due to our utilization of us federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset both regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income and to our utilization of deferred state tax benefits 
the effective income tax rate on continuing activities before utilization of nol and tax credit carryforwards and release in valuation allowance in of was higher than the irish statutory rate of due to a number of factors  including income taxable at a rate higher than the irish statutory rate  losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is available and various expenses not deductible for tax purposes 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes in  we sold the women s health business to meda for million  including million for certain inventory transferred to meda upon the closing of the sale  less transaction costs of million 
as part of the transaction  meda purchased six women s health products from us 
as part of the sale  approximately employees who directly supported the women s health business became meda employees 
we recorded a non recurring gain on the sale of million

the gain on sale of discontinued operations was not impacted by income taxes as the value attributable to the women s health business was held in a non taxable jurisdiction 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented on a gaap basis  we use certain non gaap adjusted financial measures as shown in the table and footnotes below 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and potential future results  particularly in light of the effect of various acquisition and divestiture transactions effected by us during they are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
our management regularly uses these supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand  manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions 
compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non gaap measures 
in addition  we believe that the use of these non gaap measures enhances the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period 
the adjusted financial measures  as used by us in this report  may be calculated differently from  and therefore may not be directly comparable to  similarly titled measures used by our competitors and other companies

all references to share or shares in the table above refer to jazz pharmaceuticals  inc s common stock with respect to and  and to jazz pharmaceuticals plc s ordinary shares with respect to the current year periods 
gaap income from continuing operations per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share in the comparative prior year periods were not impacted by the azur merger since each share of jazz pharmaceuticals  inc common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the azur merger was canceled and automatically converted into and became the right to receive one ordinary share upon the consummation of the azur merger 
liquidity and capital resources in january  we completed the azur merger in an all stock transaction and  in june  we acquired eusa pharma for million in cash 
most of the acquisition consideration for the eusa acquisition was funded by a million term loan under a new credit agreement  the terms of which are described in more detail below 
subsequently  in october  we completed the sale of our women s health business  a component of the acquired azur pharma business  for net cash proceeds of million 
during  and  we generated cash flows from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility of million and million principal amount outstanding under our term loan 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash we expect to generate from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and to meet our existing obligations for the foreseeable future  including our obligations under the credit agreement and a potential contingent payment of million  which we agreed to pay if erwinaze achieves us net sales of million or greater in this payment may become payable in the adequacy of our cash resources depends on many assumptions  including primarily our assumptions with respect to product sales and expenses as well as the other factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the headings xyrem is our largest selling product  and our inability to maintain or increase sales of xyrem would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects  if generic products that compete with xyrem are approved and launched  sales of xyrem would be adversely affected  the manufacture  distribution and sale of xyrem are subject to significant regulatory oversight and restrictions and the requirements of a risk management program  and these restrictions and requirements subject us to increased risks and uncertainties  any of which could negatively 
table of contents impact sales of xyrem  and to continue to grow our business  we will need to commit substantial resources  which could result in future losses or otherwise limit our opportunities or affect our ability to operate our business 
our assumptions may prove to be wrong or other factors may adversely affect our business  and as a result we could exhaust or significantly decrease our available cash resources which could  among other things  force us to raise additional funds and or force us to reduce our expenses  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our term loan is repayable in quarterly installments equal to of the original principal amount in the first year  in the second year  in each of the third and fourth years and in each of the fifth and sixth years  with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date 
through december  we have made payments of million principal amount as required under the agreement 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either the libor rate  plus an applicable margin of per annum subject to a libor floor  or the prime lending rate  plus an applicable margin equal to per annum subject to a prime rate floor 
as of december   the interest rate on the term loan was 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either the libor rate  plus an applicable margin of per annum  or the prime lending rate  plus an applicable margin equal to per annum  subject to reduction by or based upon our secured leverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility has a commitment fee payable on the undrawn amount ranging from to per annum based upon our secured leverage ratio 
we may make prepayments of principal without premium or penalty  except that a premium would apply to a repayment via a repricing of the loan under the term loan effected on or prior to june  we are required to make mandatory prepayments of borrowings under the term loan without payment of a premium with net cash proceeds from certain non ordinary course asset sales  issuances of debt other than certain permitted debt and casualty proceeds and condemnation awards  and  beginning with the fiscal year ending december   with of our excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement subject to increase to if our secured leverage ratio exceeds to  or decrease to or if our secured leverage ratio is equal to or less than to or to  respectively 
no mandatory repayment was made or is required to be made under our term loan as a result of the sale of our women s health business 
borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by jazz pharmaceuticals plc and certain of its subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of their assets 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us  including  among other things  restrictions on indebtedness  liens  investments  mergers  dispositions  prepayment of other indebtedness and dividends and other distributions 
the credit agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum secured leverage ratio 
our failure to comply with any of the operating and financial covenants contained in the credit agreement would constitute an event of default under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains other customary events of default 
if one or more events of default occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period  the administrative agent may  with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the loans and commitments under the facilities  or will  at the request of such lenders  terminate the commitments of the lenders to make further loans and declare all of the obligations under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable 
in such event  we would not have sufficient cash resources to repay the full amount of the obligations 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement 
to grow our business over the longer term  we will need to commit substantial resources to product acquisition and in licensing costs  to expensive and time consuming product development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to expanding our commercial operations 
we may need to raise additional funds to license or acquire additional products  product candidates or companies or seek to raise additional funds for general corporate purposes 
raising additional capital could be accomplished through one or more public or private debt or equity financings  collaborations or partnering arrangements 
any equity financing would be dilutive to our shareholders

contractual obligations the table below presents a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years term loan principal term loan interest purchase obligations operating lease obligations revolving credit facility contingent consideration obligation total this table does not include potential future milestone payment or royalty obligations to third parties under asset purchase  product development and license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such milestone payments are not known  and  in the case of royalty obligations  as the amount of such obligations are not estimable 
potential future milestone payments to third parties under these agreements could be up to an aggregate of million  of which up to million will become due and payable to elan in tiered contingent payments  with the first such payment becoming due if net sales of prialt of at least million are achieved in a calendar year 
the remainder would become due and payable to other third parties upon the achievement of certain developmental  clinical  regulatory and or commercial milestones  the timing and likelihood of which are not known 
we are also obligated under these agreements to pay royalties on net sales of certain products at specified rates  which royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are not estimable 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million  which matures in june  and a million revolving credit facility  which matures in june in june  we borrowed million under the term loan  and we repaid principal of million in the interest rate was at december   which we used to estimate interest owed on the term loan until the final maturity date 
consists primarily of non cancelable commitments to third party manufacturers 
includes the minimum lease payments for our office buildings and automobile lease payments for our sales force 
the revolving credit facility described in note has a commitment fee payable on the undrawn amount ranging from to per annum based upon our secured leverage ratio 
in the table above  we used a rate of and assumed undrawn amounts of million to estimate commitment fees owed 
no amount was borrowed under the revolving credit facility as of december  this amount represents a contingent payment of million that we agreed to make if erwinaze achieves us net sales of million or greater in the amount set forth in the table has not been probability adjusted or 
table of contents discounted 
the fair value of this contingent consideration as of december  was million and was recorded as a non current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
no provision for income tax in ireland has been recognized on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested 
cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries totaled approximately million at december  in the event of the distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be liable for income taxes  subject to an adjustment  if any  for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes payable to certain foreign tax authorities 
as of december   it is not practicable to determine the amount of the income tax liability related to these undistributed earnings due to a variety of factors 
as of december   our liability for unrecognized tax benefits amounted to million including interest and penalties 
due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments  if any 
therefore  our liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 
we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales  net product sales revenue is recognized when title has transferred to the customer and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  which is typically on delivery to the customer or  in the case of products that are subject to consignment agreements  when the customer removes product from our consigned inventory location for shipment directly to a patient 
a significant portion of our net product revenues are derived from sales of xyrem 
we sell xyrem in the united states to a single central pharmacy  express scripts specialty distribution services and its affiliate curascript  inc  or express scripts 
in  sales of xyrem to express scripts accounted for of our net product sales 
we recognize revenues from sales of xyrem within the united states upon transfer of title  which occurs when express scripts removes product from our consigned inventory location at its facility for shipment directly to a patient 
we accept returns from and provide express scripts with a credit for any product returned by patients to express scripts with defects that were not reasonably discoverable upon receipt of the consigned product by express scripts 
based on our experience over the past seven years  product returns to express scripts from patients are rare  during  we issued credits totaling million to express scripts for returned product 
items deducted from gross sales 
revenues from sales of products are recorded net of estimated allowances for returns  specialty distributor fees  wholesaler fees  prompt payment discounts  government rebates  government chargebacks  coupon programs and rebates under managed care plans 
calculating certain of these items involves estimates and judgments based on sales or invoice data  contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data 
we review the adequacy of our provisions for sales deductions on a quarterly basis 
amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate and to reflect actual experience 
because we derive most of our revenues from sales of xyrem in the united states to one specialty pharmacy customer  express scripts  we have a much higher level of knowledge about each prescription than if we sold the product through the normal pharmaceutical wholesaler channel as we do with our other products 
the most significant items deducted from gross revenues where we exercise judgment are rebates  sales returns and chargebacks 

table of contents the following table presents the activity and ending balances for our provisions for rebates  sale returns and chargebacks in thousands rebates payable sales returns reserve chargebacks total balance at december  provision payments credits balance at december  provision payments credits balance at december  additions relating to acquisitions provision payments credits balance at december  includes both continuing and discontinued operations to date of disposal 
for the years ended december   and  total sales deductions related to rebates  sale returns and chargebacks were  and of gross product sales  respectively 
included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales due to changes in estimates 
such amounts represented less than of net product sales for each of the three years ended december  rebates we are subject to rebates on sales made under governmental and managed care pricing programs in the united states 
the largest of these rebates is associated with sales covered by medicaid 
we participate in state government managed medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities 
we offer rebates and discounts to managed health care organizations in the united states 
in estimating our provisions for rebates  we consider relevant statutes with respect to governmental pricing programs and contractual sales terms with managed care providers and group purchasing organizations 
we estimate the rebate provision based on historical utilization rates  historical payment experience  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
sales returns for certain products  we allow customers to return product within a specified period before and after its expiration date and issue credits which may be applied against existing or future invoices 
we account for sales returns as a reduction in net revenue at the time a sale is recognized  by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to the estimated value of products expected to be returned 
the sales return accrual is estimated principally based on historical experience  the level and estimated shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel  our return policy and expected future market events including generic competition 
chargebacks we participate in chargeback programs with a number of entities  principally the us department of defense  the us department of veterans affairs and other public parties whereby pricing on products below wholesalers list prices is provided to participating entities 
these entities purchase product through wholesalers at the lower negotiated price  and the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower negotiated price which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
we determine our estimate of the chargebacks provision primarily based on historical experience on a product and program basis  current contract prices under the chargeback programs and channel inventory data 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in october and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
the annual test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this step indicates impairment  then in the second step  the loss is measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities 
we have determined the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization  as determined by our traded share price  plus a control premium 
the control premium used was based on a review of such premiums identified in recent acquisitions of companies of similar size and in similar industries 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in october and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as of december   we had million of goodwill primarily resulting from the azur merger on january  and the eusa acquisition on june  intangible assets in connection with the azur merger and the eusa acquisition  we acquired a number of intangible assets  including intangible assets related to currently marketed products developed technology and intangible assets related to product candidates ipr d 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values that we assign to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected cash flows will transpire as estimated 
in addition  we are required to estimate the period of time over which to amortize the intangible assets  which requires significant judgment 
our finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to years 
the estimated useful lives associated with intangible assets are consistent with the estimated lives of the products and may be modified when circumstances warrant 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves estimates and assumptions 
if our assumptions are not correct  there could be an impairment loss or  in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset  a change in amortization expense 
ipr d is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value may be below the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets are not expected to be recovered  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
as of december   we had million of finite lived intangible assets and million of ipr d assets primarily related to the marketed products and the ipr d projects that we acquired in the azur merger and the eusa acquisition 
please refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information about the intangible assets acquired during and the remaining useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets as of december  
table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our most significant tax jurisdictions are ireland  the united states and france 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on management s interpretations of jurisdiction specific tax laws or regulations and the likelihood of settlement related to tax audit issues 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  the impact of accounting for share based compensation  changes in our international organization  likelihood of settlement  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  the amount and timing of which are uncertain 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including cumulative income in recent fiscal years  our forecast of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage our underlying business 
based on available objective evidence at december   we reversed the valuation allowance recorded against substantially all of our deferred tax assets in the united states  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
management determined that a valuation allowance was no longer needed on these deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the relative impact of all positive and negative evidence that existed at december   including an evaluation of cumulative income in recent years  our forecast of future sources of taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences  and significant risks and uncertainties related to our business 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where realizability is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowances to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
this determination depends on a variety of factors  some of which are subjective  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
if we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period  we would record material changes to income tax expense in that period 
we have also provided for uncertain tax positions that we believe are not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision benefit 
contingent consideration as part of the eusa acquisition  we agreed to make an additional contingent payment of million in cash if erwinaze achieves us net sales of million or greater in contingent consideration is initially recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date 
a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the estimate of fair value contains uncertainties as it involves assumptions about the probability of us net sales of erwinaze equaling or exceeding the million threshold and the discount rate 
a significant increase or decrease in the estimated probability of meeting the milestone threshold would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement  respectively 
as of december   we estimated that the fair value of this contingent consideration was million 

table of contents share based compensation we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share option grants under our equity incentive plans and grants under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and we are using the straight line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods 
the fair value of share options was estimated using the following assumptions year ended december  volatility expected term years range of risk free rates expected dividend yield the two inputs which require the greatest judgment and have a large impact on fair values are expected term and volatility 
the expected term of share option grants represents the weighted average period the awards are expected to remain outstanding 
for share options granted in and  we estimated the weighted average expected term based on historical exercise data 
prior to  the expected term was estimated by assuming share options would be exercised at the mid point between the vest date and the contractual term due  at that time  to limited historical exercise data 
prior to  we used a blend of the historical volatility and implied volatility of our ordinary shares  as well as the historical volatility of a peer group  to determine expected volatility for share option grants  and we used the implied volatility of our ordinary shares for grants under our espp 
we included consideration of the historical volatility of a peer group to estimate expected volatility for share option grants since the trading history of our ordinary shares was less than the expected term of the share options 
beginning in the year ended december   we rely only on a blend of the historical and implied volatilities of our own ordinary shares to determine expected volatility for share option grants because our trading history now exceeds the expected term of the share options 
in addition  we use a single volatility estimate for each share option grant 
the weighted average volatility is determined by calculating the weighted average of volatilities for all share options granted in a given year 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued asu no 
 other comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  or asu no 
asu no 
supersedes the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asus and and requires an entity to provide additional information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu no 
became effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  or asu no 
asu no 
simplifies how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
an entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment  while no further analysis would be required if it passes 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   and early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this amendment will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
related parties in connection with the azur merger  we assumed a lease for office space in dublin  ireland 
the lease agreement was with seamus mulligan  the former chief executive officer of azur pharma  who is a member of our board of directors 
rentals paid on this lease amounted to million in in november  we terminated this lease at a cost of million  which was the carrying value of our above market lease liability 
there was no resulting gain or loss on the lease termination 
in  azur pharma entered into an agreement with circ pharma limited circ pharma research and development 
table of contents limited  or circ  companies controlled by seamus mulligan  whereby azur pharma obtained an option to license certain rights and assets in relation to tramadol a chronotherapeutic formulation and to conduct certain development activities 
azur pharma paid circ million for this option in in  we terminated the agreement at no cost 
in  we entered into an underwriting agreement with two underwriters and certain selling shareholders  pursuant to which the selling shareholders agreed to sell to the underwriters million of our ordinary shares  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the selling shareholders of approximately million 
the selling shareholders included entities affiliated with certain members of our board of directors  four of our directors and four of our executive officers at the time of the agreement 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our ordinary shares by the selling shareholders in the offering  and we paid expenses of approximately million in connection with the offering 
in  we repaid in full all of our then outstanding senior secured notes  of which million principal amount was paid to an entity affiliated with kohlberg  kravis roberts co 
lp  or kkr  a significant stockholder 
in addition  in  we paid prepayment penalties and a fee to the holders of the senior secured notes totaling million of which million was paid to the kkr affiliate 
cash paid for interest with respect to then outstanding senior secured notes held by the kkr affiliate was million in all payments to kkr were in proportion to its ownership of the senior secured notes 
in  we issued  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering of which  shares and  shares were purchased from the underwriter by longitude venture partners  lp and longitude capital associates  lp  respectively  which are entities affiliated with patrick g 
enright  a member of our board of directors 
the remaining shares were purchased from the underwriter by third party investors on the same terms and conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our exposure to market risk was confined to our cash equivalents which have maturities of less than one year and bear interest rates at variable rates and are denominated in  and pay interest in  us dollars 
the fair value of items exposed to market risk was million as of december  the primary objectives of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive yield 
although our investments are subject to market risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or certain types of investment 
our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us federal government and federal agency securities  corporate bonds or commercial paper issued by us corporations  money market instruments  certain qualifying money market mutual funds  certain repurchase agreements  and tax exempt obligations of us states  agencies and municipalities 
our cash equivalents as of december  consisted of money market funds 
the effect of a basis point change in the average yield earned on our cash equivalents would have a de minimis effect on our interest income and  due to the nature of the investments  would not have had an impact on their fair value 
for additional information see note of the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a six year million term loan and a five year million revolving credit facility 
on june   we borrowed million under the term loan 
we are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our term loan 
our indebtedness outstanding under our term loan is subject to a libor floor of 
currently libor rates are below the floor of  and therefore an increase in interest rates would only impact our net interest expense to the extent it exceeds the floor of 
based on variable rate debt levels of million as of december   a change in interest rates  above the libor floor  would impact net interest expense for by approximately million 
foreign exchange risk 
as a result of the eusa acquisition  we have significant operations in europe as well as in the united states 
the functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is generally the local currency 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the local currency financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to us dollars 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries having a functional currency other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date  and at the average exchange rate for the reporting period for revenue and expense accounts 
the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
the reported results of our foreign subsidiaries will be influenced by their translation into us dollars by currency movements against the us dollar 
our primary currency translation exposures are related to our subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in the euro and the british pound sterling  or gbp 
a strengthening weakening in the rates used to translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries would have increased decreased net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency 
transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction 
the resulting monetary assets and 
table of contents liabilities are translated into the appropriate functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are reported in the foreign currency loss in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   our primary exposure to transaction risk related to us dollar net monetary assets held by subsidiaries with a euro functional currency 
at december   a strengthening weakening in the us dollar against the euro would have increased decreased net income by approximately million
