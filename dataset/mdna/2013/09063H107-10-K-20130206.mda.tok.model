growth strategy our success and future growth potential are based upon the real estate opportunities within the life science industry 
our growth strategy is designed to meet the sizable demand and specialized requirements of life science tenants by leveraging the knowledge and expertise of a management team focused on serving this large and growing industry 
our internal growth strategy includes negotiating leases with contractual rental rate increases in order to provide predictable and consistent earnings growth  creating strong relationships with our tenants to enable us to identify and capitalize on opportunities to renew or extend existing leases or to provide expansion space  redeveloping currently owned non laboratory space into higher yielding laboratory facilities  and developing new laboratory and office space on land we have acquired for development 
our external growth strategy includes acquiring  subject to our rigorous underwriting standards  well located properties leased to high quality life science tenants with attractive in place yields and long term growth potential  investing in properties with leasing opportunities  capitalizing on our industry relationships to enter into new leases  and investing in redevelopment and development projects  capitalizing on our development platform that we believe will serve as an additional catalyst for future growth 
target markets our target markets boston  san francisco  maryland  san diego  new york new jersey  pennsylvania  seattle and research parks near or adjacent to universities have emerged as the primary hubs for research  development and production in the life science industry 
each of these markets benefits from the presence of mature life science companies  which provide scale and stability to the market  as well as academic and university environments and government entities to contribute innovation  research  personnel and capital to the private sector 
in addition  the clustered research environments within these target markets typically provide a high quality of life for the research professionals and a fertile ground for new life science ideas and ventures 
positive life science industry trends we expect continued long term growth in the life science industry due to several factors the aging of the us population resulting from the transition of baby boomers to senior citizens  which has increased the demand for new drugs and health care treatment alternatives to extend  improve and enhance their quality of life  the high level of research and development expenditures  as represented by a battelle and r d magazine survey indicating that research and development spending was billion in  and escalating health care costs  which drive the demand for better drugs  less expensive treatments and more services in an attempt to manage such costs 
we are uniquely positioned to benefit from these favorable long term dynamics through the demand for space for research  development and production by our life science industry tenants 

table of contents experienced management we have created and continue to develop a premier life science real estate oriented management team  dedicated to maximizing current and long term returns for our stockholders 
our executive team  including alan d 
gold  our company s chief executive officer and chairman  has acquired  developed  financed  owned  leased or managed in excess of billion in life science real estate 
through this experience  our management team has established extensive industry relationships among life science tenants  property owners and real estate brokers 
in addition  our experienced independent board members provide management with a broad range of knowledge in real estate  the sciences  life science company operations  and large public company finance and management 
regulation general our properties are subject to various laws  ordinances and regulations  including regulations relating to common areas 
we believe that we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties 
americans with disabilities act our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
the tenants are generally responsible for any additional amounts required to conform their construction projects to the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner  operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threats of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such property  and may be held liable for property damage  personal injury damages and investigation  clean up and monitoring costs incurred in connection with the actual or threatened contamination 
such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to fault  or whether the owner  operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination 
the liability under such laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation  clean up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken  although a party held jointly and severally liable may obtain contributions from the other identified  solvent  responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs 
these costs may be substantial  and can exceed the value of the property 
the presence of contamination  or the failure to properly remediate contamination  on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner  operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using such property as collateral  and may adversely impact our investment in that property 
federal asbestos regulations and certain state laws and regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn  via signs  labels or other notices  of potential hazards posed by the actual or potential presence of asbestos containing materials  or acms  in their building 
the regulations also set forth employee training  record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to acms and potential acms 
significant fines can be assessed for violating these regulations 
building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to acms and potential acms as a result of these regulations 
the regulations may affect the value of a building containing acms and potential acms in which we have invested 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and or disposal of acms and potential acms when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of acms and potential acms and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with acms and potential acms 
see risk factors risks related to the real estate industry we could incur significant costs related to governmental regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving asbestos containing materials  which could adversely affect our operations  the value of our properties  and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders under item a 
below 
federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations also require removing or upgrading certain underground storage tanks and regulate the discharge of storm water  wastewater and other pollutants  the emission of air pollutants  the generation  
table of contents management and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals  substances or wastes  and workplace health and safety 
life science industry tenants  including certain of our tenants  engage in various research and development activities involving the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological and radioactive compounds 
some of our tenants  particularly those in the biotechnology  life sciences and technology manufacturing industries  routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties  including acetonitrile  alcohol  ammonia  argon  batteries  carbon dioxide  chemical solvents  cryogenic gases  dichlorophenol  diesel fuel for emergency generators  fluorine  hydrocarbons  hydrogen  medical waste  methane  naturalyte acid  neon  nitrogen  nitrous oxide  oxygen  radioactive material and tetrahydrofuran 
many of these compounds and materials are used in the experiments  clinical trials  research and development and light manufacturing efforts conducted by our tenants 
although we believe that the tenants activities involving such materials comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations  the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such contamination or injury  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources and our environmental remediation insurance coverage 
licensing requirements governing use of radioactive materials by tenants may also restrict the use of or ability to transfer space in buildings we own 
see risk factors risks related to the real estate industry we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving the presence  discharge or threat of discharge of hazardous or toxic substances  which could adversely affect our operations  the value of our properties  and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders under item a 
below 
in addition  our leases generally provide that the tenant is responsible for all environmental liabilities relating to the tenant s operations  we are indemnified for such liabilities and the tenant must comply with all environmental laws and regulations 
such a contractual arrangement  however  does not eliminate our statutory liability or preclude claims against us by governmental authorities or persons who are not parties to such an arrangement 
noncompliance with environmental or health and safety requirements may also result in the need to cease or alter operations at a property  which could affect the financial health of a tenant and its ability to make lease payments 
in addition  if there is a violation of such a requirement in connection with a tenant s operations  it is possible that we  as the owner of the property  could be held accountable by governmental authorities or other injured parties for such violation and could be required to correct the violation and pay related fines 
in certain situations  we have agreed to indemnify tenants for conditions preceding their lease term  or that do not result from their operations 
prior to closing any property acquisition  we obtain environmental assessments in a manner we believe prudent in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at such properties 
these assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally include a physical site inspection  a review of relevant federal  state and local environmental and health agency database records  one or more interviews with appropriate site related personnel  review of the property s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property 
we may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the results of the first phase of the environmental assessments or other information indicate possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures 
while we may purchase our properties on an as is basis  most of our purchase contracts contain an environmental contingency clause  which permits us to reject a property because of any environmental hazard at such property 
we receive environmental reports on all prospective properties 
we believe that our properties comply in all material respects with all federal and state regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters 
insurance we carry commercial general liability  all risk property insurance subject to policy terms  conditions  limitations and exclusions  including fire and extended coverage  terrorism and loss of rental income insurance covering all of our properties under a blanket portfolio policy  with the exception of property insurance on our mckellar court property in san diego and belward campus drive and shady grove road properties in maryland  which is carried directly by the tenants in accordance with the terms of their respective leases  and builders risk policies for any projects under construction 
in addition  we carry workers compensation coverage for injury to our employees 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss  cost of the coverage and standard industry practice 
we also carry environmental insurance for our properties 
this insurance  subject to certain exclusions and deductibles  covers the cost to remediate environmental damage caused by unintentional future spills or the historic presence of previously undiscovered hazardous substances  as well as third party bodily injury and property damage claims related to the release of hazardous substances 
we intend to carry similar insurance with respect to future acquisitions as appropriate 
a substantial portion of our properties are located in areas subject to earthquake loss  such as san diego and san francisco  california and seattle  washington 
although we presently carry earthquake insurance on our properties  the amount of earthquake insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake  terrorism  windstorm or other insurance  or may elect not to procure such insurance  on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of the premiums for any of these policies exceeds  in our judgment  the 
table of contents value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
see risk factors risks related to the real estate industry uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders under item a 
below 
competition we face competition from various entities for investment opportunities in properties for life science tenants  including other reits  such as health care reits and suburban office property reits  pension funds  insurance companies  investment funds and companies  partnerships  and developers 
because properties designed for life science tenants typically contain improvements that are specific to tenants operating in the life science industry  we believe that we will be able to maximize returns on investments as a result of our expertise in understanding the real estate needs of life science industry tenants  our ability to identify  acquire and develop properties with generic laboratory infrastructure that appeal to a wide range of life science industry tenants  and our expertise in identifying and evaluating life science industry tenants 
however  some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risks  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic proximity of its investments 
in the future  competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
further  as a result of their greater resources  those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants 
these concessions could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
additionally  our ability to compete depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national and local economies  investment alternatives  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
foreign operations assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the united states with non us dollar functional currencies are translated into non us dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates

risk factors for purposes of this section  the term stockholders means the holders of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock and the term unitholders means the holders of biomed realty  lp s op units and preferred units 
risks related to our properties  our business and our growth strategy because we lease our properties to a limited number of tenants  and to the extent we depend on a limited number of tenants in the future  the inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
as of december   we had tenants in our portfolio of million square feet 
our tenant  human genome sciences  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  represented of our annualized base rent  and of our total leased rentable square footage as of december  there can be no assurance that any tenant will be able to make timely rental payments or avoid defaulting under its lease 
if a tenant defaults  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our revenue and cash flow  and consequently our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders and biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders  could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant tenants were to become bankrupt or insolvent  suffer a downturn in their business  curtail or suspend their operations  or fail to renew their leases at all or renew on terms less favorable to us than their current terms 

table of contents life science entities  which comprise the vast majority of our tenant base  face high levels of regulation  expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to pay us rent and consequently adversely affect our business 
life science entities comprise the vast majority of our tenant base and  as a result  adverse conditions affecting the life science industry will more adversely affect our business  and thus our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders and biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders  than if our business strategy included a more diverse tenant base 
life science industry tenants  particularly those involved in developing and marketing drugs and drug delivery technologies  fail from time to time as a result of various factors 
many of these factors are particular to the life science industry 
for example our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research and development and clinical testing of their products and technologies and many of them have a history of recurring losses 
the current economic environment has significantly impacted the ability of these companies to access the capital markets  including both equity financing through public offerings and debt financing 
the pace of venture capital funding has also declined from previous levels  further restricting access to capital for these companies 
in addition  state and federal government budgets have been negatively impacted by the current economic environment and  as a result certain programs  including grants related to biotechnology research and development  may be at risk of being eliminated or cut back significantly 
if private investors  the government  public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development  a tenant s business may fail 
the research and development  clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal  state and foreign regulatory approvals 
the approval process is typically long  expensive and uncertain 
even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals  one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
furthermore  our tenants may only have a small number of products under development 
if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development  it could significantly adversely affect our tenant s entire business and its ability to pay rent 
our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent  copyright or trade secret laws 
failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition 
collaborative relationships with other life science entities may be crucial to the development  manufacturing  distribution or marketing of our tenants products 
if these other entities fail to fulfill their obligations under these collaborative arrangements  our tenants businesses will suffer 
legislation to reform the us healthcare system may include government intervention in product pricing and other changes that adversely affect reimbursement for our tenants marketable products 
in addition  sales of many of our tenants marketable products are dependent  in large part  on the availability and extent of reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
changes in government regulations  price controls or third party payors reimbursement policies may reduce reimbursement for our tenants marketable products and adversely impact our tenants businesses 
we cannot assure you that our tenants in the life science industry will be successful in their businesses 
if our tenants businesses are adversely affected  they may default on their obligations to third parties  including their obligations to pay rent or pay for tenant improvements relating to space they lease  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the bankruptcy of a tenant may adversely affect the income produced by and the value of our properties 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties 
if any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under the bankruptcy code  we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy 
the bankruptcy court also might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us  which would generally result in any unpaid  pre bankruptcy rent being treated as an unsecured claim 
an unsecured claim may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
in addition  our claim against the tenant for unpaid  future rent would be subject to a statutory cap equal to the greater of one year of rent or of the remaining rent on the lease not to exceed three years of rent 
this cap might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease 
additionally  a bankruptcy court may require us to turn over to the estate all or a portion of any deposits  amounts in escrow  or prepaid rents 
our claim for unpaid  pre bankruptcy rent  our lease termination damages and claims relating to damages for which we hold deposits or other amounts that we were forced to repay would likely not be paid in full 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively  of rental operations expense related to early lease terminations and tenant receivables that were deemed to be uncollectible due to tenants that filed for bankruptcy at the time of lease termination or shortly thereafter 

table of contents we may fail to obtain the financial results expected from the properties we acquire  develop or renovate  making them unprofitable or less profitable than we had expected  or operate new properties successfully  which could harm our financial condition and ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
we continue to evaluate the market for available properties and may acquire office  laboratory and other properties when opportunities exist 
we also may develop or substantially renovate office and other properties 
acquisition  development and renovation activities are subject to significant risks  including we may spend more time or money than we budget to improve or renovate acquired properties or to develop new properties  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new properties  particularly if we acquire portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  market and economic conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates  we may face higher operating costs than we anticipated for properties that we acquire  develop or renovate  including insurance premiums  utilities  real estate taxes and costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  we may face higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for properties that we acquire  develop or renovate  particularly in older structures  we may fail to retain tenants that have pre leased our properties under development if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications  we have a limited history in conducting ground up construction activities  if we develop properties  we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  acquired and developed properties may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes  including latent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service  and we may acquire land  properties or entities owning properties  which are subject to liabilities and for which  in the case of unknown liabilities  we may have limited or no recourse 
the realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of our securities  ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
because particular upgrades are required for life science tenants  improvements to our properties involve greater expenditures than traditional office space  which costs may not be covered by the rents our tenants pay 
the improvements generally required for our properties infrastructure are more costly than for other property types 
typical infrastructural improvements include the following reinforced concrete floors  upgraded roof structures for greater load capacity  increased floor to ceiling clear heights  heavy duty hvac systems  enhanced environmental control technology  significantly upgraded electrical  gas and plumbing infrastructure  and laboratory benchwork 
we cannot assure you that our tenants will pay higher rents on our properties than tenants in traditional office space or that the rents paid will cover the additional costs of upgrading the properties 

table of contents because of the unique and specific improvements required for our life science tenants  we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make our properties suitable for other life science tenants or other office tenants  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
we acquire or develop properties that include laboratory space and other features that we believe are generally desirable for life science industry tenants 
however  different life science industry tenants may require different features in their properties  depending on each tenant s particular focus within the life science industry 
if a current tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property  we may incur substantial expenditures to modify the property before we are able to re lease the space to another life science industry tenant 
this could hurt our operating performance and the value of your investment 
also  if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple tenants  we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re lease the space 
additionally  our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures or renovations 
accordingly  any downturn in the life science industry may have a substantial negative impact on our properties values 
our success depends on key personnel with extensive experience dealing with the real estate needs of life science tenants  and the loss of these key personnel could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on the continued services of our management team 
in particular  we depend on the efforts of alan d 
gold  our chairman and chief executive officer  r 
kent griffin  jr  our president and chief operating officer  greg n 
lubushkin  our chief financial officer  gary a 
kreitzer  our executive vice president  and matthew g 
mcdevitt  our executive vice president  real estate 
among the reasons that messrs 
gold  griffin  lubushkin  kreitzer and mcdevitt are important to our success are that they have extensive real estate and finance experience  and strong reputations within the life science industry 
our management team has developed informal relationships through past business dealings with numerous members of the scientific community  life science investors  current and prospective life science industry tenants and real estate brokers 
we expect that their reputations will continue to attract business and investment opportunities before the active marketing of properties and will assist us in negotiations with lenders  existing and potential tenants  and industry personnel 
if we lost their services  our relationships with such lenders  existing and prospective tenants  and industry personnel could suffer 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
we may not be successful in acquiring and integrating properties that meet our investment criteria  which may impede our growth 
in addition to properties consisting of million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space we acquired in connection with our initial public offering in august  as of december   we had acquired or had acquired an interest in properties consisting of an additional million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space net of property dispositions 
we continue to evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist 
changing market conditions  including competition from others  may diminish our opportunities for acquiring a desired property on favorable terms or at all 
even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties  these agreements are subject to customary conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction 
we also may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all  including continued access to our unsecured line of credit  which may be necessary or desirable to fund property acquisitions 
we may not be able to quickly and efficiently integrate any properties that we acquire into our organization and manage and lease the new properties in a way that allows us to realize the financial returns that we expect 
in addition  we may incur unanticipated costs to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties 
furthermore  our efforts to integrate new property acquisitions may divert management s attention away from or cause disruptions to the operations at our existing properties 
if we fail to successfully acquire new properties or integrate them into our portfolio  or if newly acquired properties fail to perform as we expect  our results of operations  financial condition and ability to pay distributions could suffer 
the geographic concentration of our properties in boston  california and maryland makes our business particularly vulnerable to adverse conditions affecting these markets 
as of december   our boston properties represented of our annualized base rent and of our total leased square footage 
as of december   our california properties located in san francisco and san diego represented of our annualized base rent and of our total leased square footage 
as of december   our maryland properties represented of our annualized base rent and of our total leased square footage 
because of this concentration in three geographic regions  we are particularly vulnerable to adverse conditions affecting boston  california and maryland  including general economic conditions  increased competition  a downturn in the local life science industry  real estate conditions  terrorist attacks  earthquakes and wildfires and other natural disasters occurring in these regions 
in addition  we cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science industry 
the performance of the life science industry 
table of contents and the economy in general in these geographic markets may affect occupancy  market rental rates and expenses  and thus may affect our performance and the value of our properties 
we are also subject to greater risk of loss from earthquakes or wildfires because of our properties concentration in california 
the close proximity of our properties in san francisco to a fault line makes them more vulnerable to earthquakes than properties in many other parts of the country 
likewise  the wildfires occurring in the san diego area  most recently in and in  may make the properties we own in the san diego area more vulnerable to fire damage or destruction than properties in many other parts of the country 
our tax indemnification and debt maintenance obligations require us to make payments if we sell certain properties or repay certain debt  which could limit our operating flexibility 
in our formation transactions  messrs 
gold and kreitzer and certain other individuals contributed properties to our operating partnership 
if we were to dispose of these contributed assets in a taxable transaction  messrs 
gold and kreitzer and the other contributors of those assets would suffer adverse tax consequences 
in connection with these contribution transactions  we agreed to indemnify messrs 
gold and kreitzer and one other contributor against such adverse tax consequences for a period of ten years 
this indemnification will help those contributors to preserve their tax positions after their contributions 
the tax indemnification provisions were not negotiated in an arm s length transaction but were determined by our management team 
we have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts consistent with our fiduciary duties to maintain at least million of debt  some of which must be property specific  that these three contributors can guarantee in order to defer any taxable gain they may incur if our operating partnership repays existing debt 
these tax indemnification and debt maintenance obligations may affect the way in which we conduct our business 
during the indemnification period  these obligations may impact the timing and circumstances under which we sell the contributed properties or interests in entities holding the properties 
for example  these tax indemnification payments could effectively reduce or eliminate any gain we might otherwise realize upon the sale or other disposition of the related properties 
accordingly  even if market conditions might otherwise dictate that it would be desirable to dispose of these properties  the existence of the tax indemnification obligations could result in a decision to retain the properties in our portfolio to avoid having to pay the tax indemnity payments 
the existence of the debt maintenance obligations could require us to maintain debt at a higher level than we might otherwise choose 
higher debt levels could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
while we may seek to enter into tax efficient joint ventures with third party investors  we currently have no intention of disposing of these properties or interests in entities holding the properties in transactions that would trigger our tax indemnification obligations 
the involuntary condemnation of one or more of these properties during the indemnification period could  however  trigger the tax indemnification obligations described above 
the tax indemnity would equal the amount of the federal and state income tax liability the contributor would incur with respect to the gain allocated to the contributor 
the calculation of the indemnity payment would not be reduced due to the time value of money or the time remaining within the indemnification period 
the terms of the contribution agreements also require us to gross up the tax indemnity payment for the amount of income taxes due as a result of the tax indemnity payment 
messrs 
gold  and kreitzer are potential recipients of these indemnification payments 
because of these potential payments their personal interests may diverge from those of biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
risks related to the real estate industry our performance and value are subject to risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate assets and with factors affecting the real estate industry 
our ability to make expected distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders and biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses  our scheduled principal payments on debt and our capital expenditure requirements 
events and conditions that are beyond our control may decrease our cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include local oversupply  increased competition or reduced demand for life science office and laboratory space  inability to collect rent from tenants  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms  potential changes in us accounting standards regarding leases making leasing of our properties less attractive to tenants  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  
table of contents unanticipated delays in the completion of our development or redevelopment projects  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  including usage  zoning  environmental and tax laws  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing submarket demographics  and civil unrest  acts of war and natural disasters  including earthquakes  floods and fires  which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses 
in addition  we could experience a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases if any of the following occur future periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur 
any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock  ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
illiquidity of real estate investments may make it difficult for us to sell properties in response to market conditions and could harm our financial condition and ability to make distributions 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic or other conditions 
to the extent the properties are not subject to triple net leases  some significant expenditures such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should these events occur  our income and funds available for distribution could be adversely affected 
if any of the parking leases or licenses associated with our cambridge portfolio were to expire  or if we were unable to assign these leases to a buyer  it would be more difficult for us to sell these properties and would adversely affect our ability to retain current tenants or attract new tenants at these properties 
in addition  as a reit  biomed realty trust  inc may be subject to a tax on net income derived from the sale of property considered to be held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business 
we may seek to avoid this tax by complying with certain safe harbor rules that generally limit the number of properties we may sell in a given year  the aggregate expenditures made on such properties prior to their disposition  and how long we retain such properties before disposing of them 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will always be able to comply with these safe harbors 
if compliance is possible  the safe harbor rules may restrict our ability to sell assets in the future and achieve liquidity that may be necessary to fund distributions 
declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
we review the carrying value of our properties when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions including conditions resulting from the ongoing challenges facing the us and us economies  indicate potential impairment may exist 
we base our review on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
a worsening real estate market may cause us to reevaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
although we generally plan to own and operate our existing portfolio of properties over the long term  our ability and or our intent with regard to the operation of our properties may change to dictate an earlier sale date  and an impairment loss may be recognized in connection with such a proposed sale to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
such impairment charges could be material  and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and per share trading price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
during  we completed the exchange of a property for another real 
table of contents estate operating property  and the property disposed of was written down to its estimated fair value  less costs to sell  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
we may be unable to renew leases  lease vacant space or re lease space as leases expire  which could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
if we cannot renew leases  we may be unable to re lease our properties at rates equal to or above the current rate 
even if we can renew leases  tenants may be able to negotiate lower rates as a result of market conditions 
market conditions may also hinder our ability to lease vacant space in newly developed or redeveloped properties 
in addition  we may enter into or acquire leases for properties that are specially suited to the needs of a particular tenant 
such properties may require renovations  tenant improvements or other concessions in order to lease them to other tenants if the initial leases terminate 
any of these factors could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock  our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
significant competition may decrease or prevent increases in our properties occupancy and rental rates and may reduce our investment opportunities 
we face competition from various entities for investment opportunities in properties for life science tenants  including other reits  such as health care reits and suburban office property reits  pension funds  insurance companies  investment funds and companies  partnerships  and developers 
many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of its investments 
in the future  competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
further  as a result of their greater resources  those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants 
this could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock  ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders may be adversely affected 
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results  in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants 
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard setting by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission  which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies  may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
proposed changes include  but are not limited to  changes in lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fair value measures 
these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 
similarly  these changes could have a material impact on our tenants reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our tenants preferences regarding leasing real estate 
uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
we carry commercial general liability  all risk property insurance subject to policy terms  conditions  limitations and exclusions  including fire and extended coverage  terrorism and loss of rental income insurance  covering all of our properties under a blanket portfolio policy  with the exception of property insurance on our mckellar court  belward campus drive and shady grove road locations  which is carried directly by the tenants in accordance with the terms of their respective leases  and builders risk policies for any projects under construction 
in addition  we carry workers compensation coverage for injury to our employees 
we also carry environmental insurance for our properties 
this insurance  subject to certain exclusions and deductibles  covers the cost to remediate environmental damage caused by unintentional future spills or the historic presence of previously undiscovered hazardous substances  as well as third party bodily injury and property damage claims related to the release of hazardous substances 
we intend to carry similar insurance with respect to future acquisitions as appropriate 
a substantial portion of our properties are located in areas subject to earthquake loss  such as san diego and san francisco  california and seattle  washington 
although we presently carry earthquake insurance on our properties  the amount of earthquake insurance 
table of contents coverage we carry may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake  terrorism  windstorm or other insurance  or may elect not to procure such insurance  on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of the premiums for any of these policies exceeds  in our judgment  the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
the financial condition of one or more of these insurance companies could significantly deteriorate to the point that they may be unable to pay future insurance claims 
this risk has increased as a result of the current economic environment and ongoing disruptions in the financial markets 
the inability of any of these insurance companies to pay future claims under our policies may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving the presence  discharge or threat of discharge of hazardous or toxic substances  which could adversely affect our operations  the value of our properties  and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local laws  a current or previous owner  operator or tenant of real estate can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence  discharge or threat of discharge of hazardous or toxic substances 
liabilities can include the cost to investigate  clean up and monitor the actual or threatened contamination and damages caused by the contamination or threatened contamination 
environmental laws typically impose such liability on the current owner regardless of the owner s knowledge of the contamination  the timing of the contamination  the cause of the contamination  or the party responsible for the contamination 
the liability under such laws may be strict  joint and several  meaning that we may be liable regardless of whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of the contaminants  and the government entity or private party may seek recovery of the entire amount from us even if there are other responsible parties 
liabilities associated with environmental conditions may be significant and can sometimes exceed the value of the affected property 
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral 
some of our properties have had contamination in the past that required cleanup 
in most cases  we believe the contamination has been effectively remediated  and that any remaining contamination either does not require remediation or that the costs associated with such remediation will not be material to us 
however  we cannot guarantee that additional contamination will not be discovered in the future or any identified contamination will not continue to pose a threat to the environment or that we will not have continued liability in connection with such prior contamination 
our kendall square properties  in cambridge  massachusetts  are located on the site of a former manufactured gas plant 
various remedial actions were performed on these properties  including soil stabilization to control the spread of oil and hazardous materials in the soil 
another of our properties  elliott avenue  has known soil contamination beneath a portion of the building located on the property 
based on environmental consultant reports  management does not believe any remediation of the elliott avenue property would be required unless major structural changes were made to the building that resulted in the soil becoming exposed 
in addition  the remediation of certain environmental conditions at off site parcels located in cambridge  massachusetts  which was an assumed obligation of one of our joint ventures with prudential real estate investors or prei  prei ii llc  had been substantially completed as of december  we do not expect these matters to materially adversely affect such properties value or the cash flows related to such properties  but we can provide no assurances to that effect 
environmental laws also may require the removal or upgrade of underground storage tanks  regulate the discharge of storm water  wastewater and other pollutants  regulate air pollutant emissions  
table of contents regulate hazardous materials generation  management and disposal  and regulate workplace health and safety 
life science industry tenants  our primary tenant industry focus  frequently use hazardous materials  chemicals  heavy metals  and biological and radioactive compounds 
our tenants controlled use of these materials subjects us and our tenants to laws that govern using  manufacturing  storing  handling and disposing of such materials and certain byproducts of those materials 
we are unaware of any of our existing tenants violating applicable laws and regulations  but we and our tenants cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials 
if our properties become contaminated  or if a party is injured  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
such liability could exceed our resources and any environmental remediation insurance coverage we have  which could adversely affect our operations  the value of our properties  and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
licensing requirements governing use of radioactive materials by tenants may also restrict the use of or ability to transfer space in buildings we own 
we could incur significant costs related to governmental regulation and private litigation over environmental matters involving asbestos containing materials  which could adversely affect our operations  the value of our properties  and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of acms and may impose fines and penalties  including orders prohibiting the use of the affected property by us or our tenants  if we fail to comply with these requirements 
failure to comply with these laws  or even the presence of acms  may expose us to third party liability 
some of our properties contain acms  and we could be liable for such fines or penalties  as described above in item business regulation environmental matters 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem  which could adversely affect the value of the affected property and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing because exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability to our tenants  their or our employees  and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada and similar laws may require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures 
all of our properties are required to comply with the ada 
the ada requires that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ada  we have not conducted an audit of all of such properties to determine compliance 
if one or more properties are not in compliance with the ada  then we would be required to bring the non compliant properties into compliance 
compliance with the ada could require removing access barriers 
non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages and or attorneys fees to private litigants  or both 
additional federal  state and local laws also may require us to modify properties or could restrict our ability to renovate properties 
complying with the ada or other legislation could be very expensive 
if we incur substantial costs to comply with such laws  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock  our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders and biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders could be adversely affected 
we may incur significant unexpected costs to comply with fire  safety and other regulations  which could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  and ability to make distributions 
our properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and safety requirements  building codes and land use regulations 
failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to governmental fines or private litigant damage awards 
in addition  we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements  including any requirements that may emerge from pending or future climate change legislation  will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow

risks related to our capital structure a downgrade in our investment grade credit rating could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in april  we received investment grade corporate credit ratings from two rating agencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings 
any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by either or both of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital  which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and a material adverse effect on the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
debt obligations expose us to increased risk of property losses and may have adverse consequences on our business operations and our ability to make distributions 
we have used and will continue to use debt to finance property acquisitions 
our use of debt may have adverse consequences  including the following we may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt 
if we cannot repay  refinance or extend our debt at maturity  in addition to our failure to repay our debt  we may be unable to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders at expected levels or at all 
even if we are able to refinance or extend our existing debt  the terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt 
if the refinancing involves a higher interest rate  it could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to unitholders and stockholders 
required payments of principal and interest may be greater than our cash flow from operations 
we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties  possibly on disadvantageous terms  to make payments on our debt 
one or more lenders under our million unsecured line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail  and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms  or at all 
if we default on our debt obligations  the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans 
further  if we default under a mortgage loan  we will automatically be in default on any other loan that has cross default provisions  and we may lose the properties securing all of these loans 
a foreclosure on one of our properties will be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt 
if the outstanding balance of the secured debt exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure without realizing any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax or to make distributions based on reit taxable income 
as of december   we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately million  excluding approximately million of debt premium  million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the exchangeable senior notes due  or the exchangeable senior notes  million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the unsecured senior notes due  or the notes due  excluding approximately million of debt discount  million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the unsecured senior notes due  or the notes due  excluding approximately million of debt discount  million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes due  excluding approximately million of debt discount  approximately million in outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior term loan  million in outstanding borrowings under our million unsecured line of credit  and million of borrowings under a secured loan representing our proportionate share of indebtedness in our unconsolidated partnerships 
we expect to incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of debt that we may incur 
as of december   the principal payments due for our consolidated indebtedness were million in  million in and million in our consolidated indebtedness that matures in includes a mortgage secured by our center for life science boston property 
given current economic conditions including  but not limited to  the ongoing challenges impacting the global financial system  we may be unable to refinance these obligations when due  which may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 

table of contents disruptions in the financial markets and the downturn of the broader us economy could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms  or at all  and have other adverse effects on us 
in recent years  the us credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for some borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on reasonable terms or at all  which may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations  make acquisitions and fund current and future development and redevelopment projects 
in addition  if the financial position of the lenders under our unsecured line of credit worsened they could default on their obligations to make available to us the funds under that facility 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors could make it more difficult for us to sell properties or adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
adverse events in the credit markets could also have an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states and globally  including the stock markets  which could make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities 
reduced access to liquidity could have a negative impact on the us economy  affecting consumer confidence and spending and negatively impacting the volume and pricing of real estate transactions 
if there were a downturn in the national economy  the value of our properties  as well as the income we receive from our properties  could be adversely affected 
disruptions in the financial markets could also have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally  which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt obligations and our ability to pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments  adversely affecting our ability to service our debt obligations and pay distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
interest we pay could reduce cash available for payments with respect to distributions 
additionally  if we incur variable rate debt  including borrowings under our million unsecured line of credit  to the extent not adequately hedged  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs 
these increased interest costs would reduce our cash flows and our ability to make payments with respect to distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders and biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
in addition  if we need to repay existing debt during a period of rising interest rates  we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments 
the terms governing our unsecured line of credit  notes due  notes due and notes due include restrictive covenants relating to our operations  which could limit our ability to respond to changing market conditions and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
the terms of our unsecured line of credit impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt  including financial covenants relating to the minimum amounts of net worth  fixed charge coverage  unsecured debt service coverage  overall leverage and unsecured leverage ratios  the maximum amount of secured indebtedness and certain investment limitations 
the indentures governing the notes due  the notes due and the notes due also contain financial and operating covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to take specific actions  even if we believe them to be in our best interest  including restrictions on our ability to consummate a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness 
the covenants relating to our unsecured line of credit  the notes due  the notes due and the notes due may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating plans 
our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions relating to our credit agreement governing our unsecured line of credit and the indentures governing the notes due  the notes due and the notes due may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in general business and economic conditions  adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness  which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay it  pursue our business plan or make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
if we fail to obtain external sources of capital  which is outside of our control  we may be unable to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders  maintain our reit qualification  or fund growth 

table of contents in order to maintain biomed realty trust  inc s qualification as a reit and to avoid incurring a nondeductible excise tax  we are required  among other things  to distribute annually at least of biomed realty trust  inc s reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of biomed realty trust  inc s net taxable income  including any net capital gains 
because of these distribution requirements  we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including any necessary acquisition financing  from operating cash flow 
consequently  we rely on third party sources to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain financings on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  with respect to acquisition financing  the market s perception of the value of the properties to be acquired  our current debt levels  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock 
our inability to obtain capital from third party sources will adversely affect our business and limit our growth 
without sufficient capital  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
we have and may continue to engage in hedging transactions  which can limit our gains and increase exposure to losses 
we have and may continue to enter into hedging transactions to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt 
our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements  or other interest rate exchange contracts 
hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection 
the duration or the amount of the hedge may not match the duration or amount of the related liability 
the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay 
the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction 
the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our stockholders equity 
hedging involves risk and typically involves costs  including transaction costs  that may reduce our overall returns on our investments 
these costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
these costs will also limit the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions 
the reit qualification rules may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by requiring us to limit our income from hedges 
if we are unable to hedge effectively because of the reit rules  we will face greater interest rate exposure than may be commercially prudent 
risks related to our organizational structure biomed realty trust  inc s charter and maryland law contain provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 

table of contents biomed realty trust  inc s charter  including the articles supplementary with respect to its preferred stock  contains ownership limits that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
biomed realty trust  inc s charter  with certain exceptions  authorizes biomed realty trust  inc s directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve its qualification as a reit 
unless exempted by its board of directors  no person may own more than of the value of biomed realty trust  inc s outstanding shares of capital stock or more than in value or number whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of its common stock or series a preferred stock 
the board may not grant such an exemption to a person whose ownership in excess of of biomed realty trust  inc s outstanding shares would result in biomed realty trust  inc s failure to qualify as a reit 
these restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors determines that it is no longer in biomed realty trust  inc s best interests to qualify as a reit 
the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders 
biomed realty trust  inc could authorize and issue stock without stockholder approval that may delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
biomed realty trust  inc s charter authorizes it to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of its common stock or preferred stock 
in addition  biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
the board may also  without stockholder approval  amend biomed realty trust  inc s charter to increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock that it may issue 
the board of directors could establish a class or series of common stock or preferred stock that could  depending on the terms of such class or series  delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders 
certain provisions of maryland law could delay  defer or prevent a change of control transaction 
certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or the mgcl  may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control 
in some cases  such an acquisition or change of control could provide biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of their shares 
these mgcl provisions include business combination provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for certain periods 
an interested stockholder is generally any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of biomed realty trust  inc s outstanding voting shares or an affiliate or associate of ours who  at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of biomed realty trust  inc s then outstanding stock 
a person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder 
business combinations with an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
after that period  the mgcl imposes two super majority voting requirements on such business combinations  and control share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of biomed realty trust  inc acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding interested shares 
control shares are voting shares that  when aggregated with all other shares owned by the stockholder or in respect of which the stockholder is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors 
a control share acquisition is the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares 
in the case of the business combination provisions of the mgcl  we opted out by resolution of biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors with respect to any business combination between us and any person provided such business combination is first approved by biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person 
in the case of the control share provisions of the mgcl  we opted out pursuant to a provision in biomed realty trust  inc s bylaws 
however  biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors may by resolution elect to opt in to the business combination provisions of the mgcl 
further  we may opt in to the control share provisions of the mgcl in the future by amending biomed realty trust  inc s bylaws  which biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors can do without stockholder approval 
the partnership agreement of biomed realty  lp  maryland law  and biomed realty trust  inc s charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders 
biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors may amend our investing and financing policies in a manner that could increase the risk we default under our debt obligations or that could harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors has adopted a policy of targeting our indebtedness at approximately of our total asset book value 
however  our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of debt that we may incur  nor do they limit the types of properties we may acquire or develop 
biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing or investing at any time without stockholder approval 
changes in our strategy or in our investment or leverage policies could expose us to greater credit risk and interest rate risk and could also result in a more leveraged balance sheet 
these factors could result in an increase in our debt service and could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to biomed realty  lp s unitholders or biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
higher leverage also increases the risk we could default on our debt 
we may invest in properties with other entities  and our lack of sole decision making authority or reliance on a co venturer s financial condition could make these joint venture investments risky 
we have in the past and may continue in the future to co invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities 
we may acquire non controlling interests or share responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
in such events  we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property or entity 
investments in entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved 
these risks include the possibility that partners or co venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 
such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers if we structure a joint venture or conduct business in a manner that is deemed to be a general partnership with a third party  in which case we could be liable for the acts of that third party  third party managers incur debt or other liabilities on behalf of a joint venture which the joint venture is unable to pay  and the joint venture agreement provides for capital calls  in which case we could be liable to make contributions as set forth in any such joint venture agreement  or we agree to cross default provisions or to cross collateralize our properties with the properties in a joint venture  in which case we could face liability if there is a default relating to those properties in the joint venture or the obligations relating to those properties 
we have investments in joint ventures with prei  which were formed in the second quarter of while we  as managing member  are authorized to carry out the day to day management of the business and affairs of the prei joint ventures  prei s prior written consent is required for certain decisions  including decisions relating to financing  budgeting and the sale or pledge of interests in the properties owned by the prei joint ventures 
risks related to biomed realty trust  inc s reit status biomed realty trust  inc s failure to qualify as a reit under the code would result in significant adverse tax consequences to us and would adversely affect our business 
we believe that we have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner intended to allow biomed realty trust  inc to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a seemingly minor technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize biomed realty trust  inc s reit status 
biomed realty trust  inc s reit status depends upon various factual matters and circumstances that may not be entirely within our control 
for example  in order for biomed realty trust  inc to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources  and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets 
also  biomed realty trust  inc must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of biomed realty trust  inc s reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
in addition  new 
table of contents legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions  each of which could have retroactive effect  may make it more difficult or impossible for biomed realty trust  inc to qualify as a reit  or could reduce the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that biomed realty trust  inc qualifies as a reit  and the statements in this report are not binding on the irs or any court 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that biomed realty trust  inc has qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit 
if biomed realty trust  inc fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will face serious adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and for distribution to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
if biomed realty trust  inc 
fails to qualify as a reit we would not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we could also be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  biomed realty trust  inc could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year in which biomed realty trust  inc was disqualified 
in addition  if biomed realty trust  inc fails to qualify as a reit  we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders  however  distributions to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders would be subject to tax as corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
as a result of all these factors  biomed realty trust  inc s failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
to maintain biomed realty trust  inc s reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions to make distributions to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders 
for biomed realty trust  inc to qualify as a reit  we generally must distribute to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders at least of our reit taxable income each year  determined by excluding any net capital gain  and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than of our reit taxable income each year 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
to maintain biomed realty trust  inc s reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements 
these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes  the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves  or required debt or amortization payments 
we may need to borrow funds at times when the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowing 
these borrowings could increase our costs or reduce our equity and adversely affect the value of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock 
to maintain biomed realty trust  inc s reit status  we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
for biomed realty trust  inc to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders and the ownership of biomed realty trust  inc s stock 
we may be required to make distributions to biomed realty trust  inc s stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
risks related to the ownership of biomed realty trust  inc stock the market price and trading volume of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock may be volatile 

table of contents the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock has recently been  and may continue to be  volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in biomed realty trust  inc s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
we cannot assure you that the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect biomed realty trust  inc s share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions  changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates  publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of biomed realty trust  inc s shares to demand a higher yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur or acquisitions we make in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional stockholders  speculation in the press or investment community  the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this report  and general market and economic conditions 
broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
the stock market has experienced continuing significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of the securities of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations could reduce the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations 
either of these factors could lead to a material decline in the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock 
one of the factors that will influence the price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock will be the dividend yield on such stock as a percentage of the price of the stock relative to market interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or preferred stock to expect a higher dividend yield  and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and preferred stock to fall 
our distributions to unitholders and stockholders may decline at any time 
we may not continue our current level of distributions to unitholders and stockholders 
biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors will determine future distributions based on a number of factors  including cash available for distribution  operating results  our financial condition  especially in relation to our anticipated future capital needs  then current expansion plans  
table of contents the distribution requirements for reits under the code  and other factors our board deems relevant 
in april  in an effort to maintain financial flexibility in light of the current capital markets environment  we reset our annual dividend rate on shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock and the annual distribution rate on biomed realty  lp s op units to per share or unit  starting in the second quarter of we subsequently increased these rates periodically and declared dividends and distributions equal to an annualized rate of per share or unit  starting in the fourth quarter of the decision to declare and pay dividends on shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or distributions to biomed realty  lp s op units in the future  as well as the timing  amount and composition of any such future dividends  will be at the sole discretion of biomed realty trust  inc s board of directors in light of conditions then existing  including our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  debt maturities  the availability of debt and equity capital  applicable reit and legal restrictions and the general overall economic conditions and other factors 
any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
the number of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
we cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
as of december    shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock were issued and outstanding  as well as biomed realty lp s operating partnership units and ltip units which may be exchanged for  and  shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock  respectively  based on the number of shares of common stock  operating partnership units and ltip units outstanding as of december  in addition  as of december   we had reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance under our incentive award plan  and  shares potentially issuable upon exchange of the exchangeable senior notes based on the exchange rate as of december  
sales of substantial amounts of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock in the public market  or upon exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units  or the exchangeable senior notes  or the perception that such sales might occur  could adversely affect the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
furthermore  under the rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission regarding registration and offering procedures  if we meet the definition of a well known seasoned issuer under rule of the securities act  we are permitted to file an automatic shelf registration statement that will be immediately effective upon filing 
on august   we filed such an automatic shelf registration statement which may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities to the extent necessary or advisable to meet our liquidity needs 
any of the following could have an adverse effect on the market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock the exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units or the exchangeable senior notes  additional grants of ltip units  restricted stock or other securities to our directors  executive officers and other employees under our incentive award plan  additional issuances of preferred stock with liquidation or distribution preferences  and other issuances of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock 
additionally  the existence of operating partnership units  ltip units or the exchangeable senior notes and shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of operating partnership units  ltip units or the exchangeable senior notes and under our incentive award plan may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
in addition  future sales of shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
from time to time we also may issue shares of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or biomed realty  lp operating partnership units in connection with property  portfolio or business acquisitions 
we may grant additional demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances 
sales of substantial amounts of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock  or the perception that these sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price of biomed realty trust  inc s common stock or may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 

table of contents risks related to international operations our ownership of granta park in the united kingdom and future activities outside the united states may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations 
in june  we acquired granta park  comprising eleven laboratory and office buildings and a total of approximately  square feet of space  as well as approximately  square feet of development and expansion rights  in cambridge  united kingdom 
the purchase price for the property was million  or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect as of june   excluding transaction costs 
in addition to granta park  in the future we may underwrite and acquire other properties or interests in real estate related entities in international markets that are new to us 
our international investments  consisting only of granta park  constituted of our total gross assets as of december  international development  ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations 
these risks include but are not limited to our limited knowledge of and relationships with sellers  tenants  contractors  suppliers or other parties in these markets  challenges in managing and integrating international operations  development and redevelopment  including difficulty in hiring qualified management  sales and construction personnel and service providers in a timely fashion  changes in foreign political  regulatory and economic conditions  including regionally  nationally and locally  challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  including those relating to real estate  corporate governance  operations  taxes  employment and legal proceedings  establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations  adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies  challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings  differences in lending practices  and differences in languages  cultures and time zones 
the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we acquired granta park in june  and may acquire additional properties in the united kingdom or in other countries where the us dollar is not the local currency 
as a result  we are subject to international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
a significant decrease in the value of the british pound or other currencies in countries where we may have an investment could materially affect our results of operations 
we may attempt to mitigate such effects by borrowing in the local foreign currency in which we invest and  under certain circumstances  by hedging exchange rate fluctuations  however  access to capital may be more restricted  or unavailable on favorable terms or at all  in certain locations  and we cannot assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks 
in addition  any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the gross income test or the gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 
risks related to our other investments we face risks associated with our investment in a construction loan secured by a property under development and future investments in loans  including a failure of an underlying property to perform to expectations and potential principal losses on our investment 

table of contents in may  we purchased a million interest in a million construction loan  or the construction loan  secured by first priority mortgages on the properties owned and under development by the borrower located in boston  massachusetts  and may make similar investments in the future 
we began funding the construction loan in monthly draws starting in the fourth quarter of and expect to fund the full balance of the construction loan by the first quarter of we face risks associated with our investment in the construction loan and other similar investments that we may undertake in the future  including the following a loan may become non performing or sub performing for a variety of reasons outside of our control  including  without limitation  because the underlying property is too highly leveraged  the borrower falls upon financial distress or the property fails to perform as expected  resulting in the borrower being unable to meet its debt service obligations to us 
a non performing or sub performing loan may require a substantial amount of workout negotiations and or restructuring  which may divert the attention of our management from other activities and entail  among other things  a substantial reduction in the interest rate  capitalization of interest payments and a substantial write down of the principal of the loan 
if we find it necessary or desirable to foreclose on one or more loans we acquire  the foreclosure process may be lengthy and expensive  with an uncertain outcome  and the underlying property s value may deteriorate as a result 
as is the case with our investment in the construction loan  we may co invest in mortgage loans with other investors 
as a result  we may lack sole decision making authority  rely on co investors financial condition and or have disputes between us and other co investors 
in addition  such co investors may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  or take actions contrary to our policies or objectives 
the realization of any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
external factors may adversely impact the valuation of our investments in publicly traded companies  privately held companies and venture capital funds 
we hold investments in certain publicly traded companies  privately held companies and venture capital funds primarily involved in the life science industry 
the valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our control  including  but not limited to  market prices  economic conditions  prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results  the availability of financing sources  legislative developments  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
unfavorable developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our investments

overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership of which biomed realty trust  inc is the parent company and general partner  which may be referred to herein as the operating partnership 
biomed realty trust  inc conducts its business and owns its assets through the operating partnership and operates as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit 
the operating partnership is focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san francisco  maryland  san diego  new york new jersey  pennsylvania and seattle 
we were formed on april  and completed biomed realty trust  inc s initial public offering on august  at december   we owned or had interests in a portfolio of properties with an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet 
factors which may influence future operations our long term corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   our total operating portfolio was  leased on a weighted average basis  to tenants 
as of december   our total operating portfolio was  leased on a weighted average basis  to tenants 
the increase in the leased percentage was due to an increase in leased square feet related to increased leasing activity  a fully leased property placed into service from redevelopment and acquisitions of highly leased properties 
our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing vacant space  negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
we may proceed with additional new developments and acquisitions  as real estate and capital market conditions permit 
as of december   leases representing  of our leased square feet are scheduled to expire during the success of our leasing and development strategy depends on  among other things  the general economic conditions  real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in our target markets in the united states and united kingdom 
as a result of changing market conditions and the recent economic recession  we believe that the fair values of some of our properties may have declined below their respective carrying values 
however  to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
during the year ended december   we disposed of one property in an exchange with a third party for another operating property 
as the carrying value of the property disposed of was less than the consideration received in exchange  an impairment loss was recorded 
we presently have the ability and intent to continue to own and operate our existing portfolio of properties and estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation of the properties are expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying value of each property 
accordingly  we do not believe that the carrying value of any of our other properties is impaired 
if our ability and or our intent with regard to the operation of our properties otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an additional impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material 
lease expirations the following is a summary of lease expirations over the next ten calendar years for leases in place at december  this table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights  if any  at or prior to the scheduled expirations 
table of contents current percent of annualized percent of current current base rent leased leased annualized annualized per leased year of lease expiration square feet square feet base rent base rent square feet in thousands month to month thereafter total portfolio weighted average the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and life science industry trends in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san francisco  maryland  san diego  new york new jersey  pennsylvania and seattle and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements remaining useful life  not to exceed years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income 
if expected useful lives of our investments in real estate were shortened  we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period  resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis 

table of contents management must make significant assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities acquired 
the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase cost of the acquired properties could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
the fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  buildings and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements are recorded based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes and insurance  and the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period see discussion of the recognition of acquired above market and below market leases in the section entitled revenue recognition  operating expenses and lease terminations below 
the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination is determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
costs incurred in connection with the development or construction of properties and improvements are capitalized 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other direct costs incurred during the period of development 
we capitalize costs on land and buildings under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy 
the determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
we consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction 
costs associated with acquisitions are charged to expense as incurred 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long term  if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
revenue recognition  operating expenses and lease terminations we commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors 
in most cases  revenue recognition under a lease begins when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased asset 
generally  this occurs on the lease commencement date 
in determining what constitutes the leased asset  we evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements 
if we are the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements  then the leased asset is the finished space and revenue recognition begins when the lessee takes possession of the finished space  typically when the improvements are substantially complete 
if we conclude that we are not the owner  for accounting purposes  
table of contents of the tenant improvements the lessee is the owner  then the leased asset is the unimproved space and any tenant improvement allowances funded under the lease are treated as lease incentives  which reduce revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining non cancelable term of the respective lease 
in these circumstances  we begin revenue recognition when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for the lessee to construct improvements 
the determination of who is the owner  for accounting purposes  of the tenant improvements determines the nature of the leased asset and when revenue recognition under a lease begins 
we consider a number of different factors to evaluate whether we or the lessee is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes 
these factors include whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent  whether the tenant or landlord retain legal title to the improvements  the uniqueness of the improvements  the expected economic life of the tenant improvements relative to the length of the lease  the responsible party for construction cost overruns  and who constructs or directs the construction of the improvements 
the determination of who owns the tenant improvements  for accounting purposes  is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination we consider all of the above factors 
however  no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
existing leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired property 
an identifiable lease intangible asset or liability is recorded based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination were determined to be likely eg  in the case of a tenant bankruptcy prior to its contractual expiration  amortization of the related unamortized above or below market lease intangible would be accelerated and such amounts written off 
rental operations expenses  consisting of real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  are subject to recovery from tenants under the terms of our lease agreements 
amounts recovered are dependent on several factors  including occupancy and lease terms 
revenues are recognized in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recorded in revenues as tenant recoveries  and the expenses are recorded in rental operations expenses  as the company is generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the credit risk 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the recoverability of tenant balances  including rents receivable  straight line rents receivable  tenant improvements  deferred leasing costs and any acquisition intangibles 
when it is determined that the recoverability of tenant balances is not probable  an allowance for expected losses related to tenant receivables  including straight line rents receivable is recorded as a charge to earnings 
upon the termination of a lease  the amortization of tenant improvements  deferred leasing costs and acquisition intangible assets and liabilities is accelerated to the expected termination date as a charge to their respective line items and tenant receivables are written off as a reduction of the allowance in the period in which the balance is deemed to be no longer collectible 
for financial reporting purposes  a lease is treated as terminated upon a tenant filing for bankruptcy  when a space is abandoned and a tenant ceases rent payments  or when other circumstances indicate that termination of a tenant s lease is probable eg  eviction 
lease termination fees are recognized in other revenue when the related leases are canceled  the amounts to be received are fixed and determinable and collectability is assured  and when we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
investments in partnerships and limited liability companies we evaluate our investments in limited liability companies and partnerships to determine whether such entities may be a variable interest entity  or vie  and  if a vie  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
generally  an entity is determined to be a vie when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the 
table of contents equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance including  but not limited to  the ability to direct financing  leasing  construction and other operating decisions and activities 
in addition  we consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions  to replace or remove the manager of the entity and to liquidate or sell the entity 
the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits when a reporting entity is affiliated with a vie must be based on ownership  contractual  and or other pecuniary interests in that vie 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in six vies  consisting of single tenant properties in which the tenant has a fixed price purchase option  which are consolidated and reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the above conditions do not apply  we consider whether a general partner or managing member controls a limited partnership or limited liability company  respectively 
the general partner in a limited partnership or managing member in a limited liability company is presumed to control that limited partnership or limited liability company  as applicable 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners or members have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or limited liability company  as applicable  or otherwise remove the general partner or managing member  as applicable  without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners or members with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s or limited liability company s business  as applicable  and thereby preclude the general partner or managing member from exercising unilateral control over the partnership or limited liability company  as applicable 
if these criteria are met and we are the general partner or the managing member  as applicable  the consolidation of the partnership or limited liability company is required 
except for investments that are consolidated  we account for investments in entities over which we exercise significant influence  but do not control  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity in the investment is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and its share of net income or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated partnerships or limited liability companies may be impaired on a more than temporary basis 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment on a more than temporary basis 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
management does not believe that the value of any of our unconsolidated investments in partnerships or limited liability companies was impaired as of december  assets and liabilities measured at fair value we measure financial instruments and other items at fair value where required under gaap  but have elected not to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value as permitted under fair value option accounting guidance 
fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  there is a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 

table of contents we have used interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk 
the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves 
the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts 
the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
derivative instruments we record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
in determining the fair value of our derivatives  we consider our credit risk and that of our counterparties 
these counterparties are generally larger financial institutions engaged in providing a variety of financial services 
these institutions generally face similar risks regarding adverse changes in market and economic conditions  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates  equity and commodity prices and credit spreads 
the ongoing disruptions in the financial markets have heightened the risks to these institutions 
while management believes that our counterparties will meet their obligations under the derivative contracts  it is possible that defaults may occur 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
if charges relating to the hedged transaction are being deferred pursuant to redevelopment or development activities  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative are also deferred in other comprehensive income  and are amortized to the income statement once the deferred charges from the hedged transaction begin again to affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives that are not classified as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized directly in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions 
we principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities 
we manage economic risks  including interest rate  liquidity  and credit risk primarily by managing the amount  sources  and duration of our debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments 
specifically  we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known or expected cash amounts  the value of which are determined by interest rates 
our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount  timing  and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to our investments and borrowings 
our primary objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during the years ended december   and  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and future variability in the interest related cash flows from forecasted issuances of debt see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we formally document the hedging relationships for all derivative instruments  have historically accounted for our interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  and do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents results of operations leasing activity during the year ended december   we executed leasing transactions representing approximately million square feet  including new leases totaling approximately million square feet and leases were amended to extend their terms totaling  square feet

leases on space which  in management s evaluation  require significant improvements to prepare or condition the premises for its intended purpose or enhance the value of the property 
this generally includes capital expenditures for development  redevelopment or repositioning a property 
leases which are not considered by management to be first generation leases 
the following table summarizes our leasing activity and associated leasing costs for the year ended december  
table of contents number of leases square feet tenant improvement costs per square foot lease commission costs per square foot tenant concession costs per square foot renewals  amendments  and extensions new leases first generation new leases second generation total weighted average includes both rent concessions due to free or discounted rent periods and lease incentives paid to tenants 
renewals  amendments and extensions were leased at a weighted average current annualized base rent of per square foot  representing an increase of over the previously expiring rents on a gaap basis  excluding renewals of leases with tenants experiencing financial difficulties for which we were not previously recognizing revenue  or tenants that have been given concessions on a temporary basis as they are relocated into new leases at other properties 
redevelopment development activity we are actively engaged in the redevelopment and development of certain properties in our portfolio 
we believe that these activities will ultimately result in a return on our additional investment once the redevelopment and development activities have been completed and the properties are leased 
however  redevelopment and development activities involve inherent risks and assumptions relating to our ability to fully lease the properties 
our objective is to have these properties fully leased upon completion of the construction activities 
however  our ability to fully lease the properties may be adversely affected by changing market conditions  including periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for life science office and laboratory space  local oversupply of real estate assets  or competition from others  any of which may diminish our opportunities for leasing the property on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may fail to retain tenants that have leased our properties  or may face significant monetary penalties  if we do not complete the construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants specifications 
further  our competitors with greater resources may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract tenants to their properties  which could put pressure on our ability to attract tenants at rental rates that will provide an expected return on our additional investment in these properties 
as a result  we may be unable to fully lease some of our redevelopment development properties in a timely manner upon the completion of major construction activities 
we also rely on external sources of debt and equity funding to provide capital for our redevelopment and development projects 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient borrowing capacity and will be able to obtain additional funding as necessary  we may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all or we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  which may require us to adjust our business and construction plans accordingly 
further  we may spend more time or money than anticipated to redevelop or develop our properties due to delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations or other unanticipated delays in the construction
