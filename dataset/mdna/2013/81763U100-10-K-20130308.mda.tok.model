overview we are the global leader in recurring revenue management  partnering with technology and technology enabled companies to optimize maintenance  support and subscription revenue streams  while also improving customer relationships and loyalty 
we deliver these results via a cloud application with a suite of managed services through dedicated service teams  leveraging benchmarks and best practices derived from our rich database of service and renewal behavior 
by integrating software  managed services and data  we provide end to end management and optimization of the service contract renewals process  including data management  quoting  selling and recurring revenue business intelligence 
our business is built on our pay for performance model  whereby customers pay us a commission based on renewal sales that we generate on their behalf  enabling a success driven  shared risk partnership with our customers 
we recently began to unbundle our renewal management software and offer as a software as a service saas solution to customers 
we believe selling software subscription as a stand alone saas offering will be an important part of our business over time 
as of december   we managed over engagements across more than customers  representing over billion in service revenue opportunity under management 
we were formed in november as a limited liability company  and shortly thereafter we purchased certain assets of a business originally started by service sales representatives from a major technology company 
since then we have refined our business model  developed and expanded our service sales teams  and our suite of 
table of contents cloud based applications  and opened additional sales centers in the united states  europe and asia and a global sales operations center in kuala lumpur  malaysia 
we broadened our customer focus from technology companies to also include technology enabled healthcare and life sciences and industrial systems companies 
we have experienced rapid growth in our operations in recent periods  as indicated by the following our revenue has increased from million in to million in  representing an increase of 
our engagements have grown from approximately as of december  to over as of december  over the past several quarters  we have invested a substantial portion of our research and development resources toward the development of renew ondemand  a cloud application purpose built to maximize recurring revenues 
total spending on research and development  including amounts capitalized as internal use software  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently derive a small portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our legacy cloud applications 
with the launch of renew ondemand  we have gone to market with two distinct offerings 
first  our renew ondemand saas solution and its cloud applications 
and second  a menu of services  including data services  enablement services  selling services and support services which customers can attach to their saas subscription 
we believe our strategy of combing subscriptions to our cloud applications with a suite of managed services provides our customers with software and services needed to maximize renewals of subscriptions  maintenance and support contracts 
to date  a limited number of customers are using our renew ondemand platform to manage their recurring revenues 
as a result  renew ondemand is largely unproven and we have little experience implementing it with customers 
accordingly  we intend to control the pace of customer deployments in the first half of to ensure the successful rollout of our cloud applications 
as the year progresses  we expect most new engagements will have a renew ondemand commercial subscription relationship even for customers that continue to choose our full pay for performance offering 
as we move to an unbundled solution of software and services  we anticipate significant investments in implementation resources as well as support and training functions  all of which will adversely impact our gross profit in the near term 
we also expect to incur additional expenses as a result of running dual technology platforms for the next several quarters as we move toward broad adoption of renew ondemand while also maintaining our legacy technology platform 
in addition  we anticipate our our total spending on research and development will increase in absolute dollars in relative to as we invest in our suite of cloud application 
key business metrics in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of business metrics in addition to the financial metrics discussed below under  basis of presentation 
these key metrics include service revenue opportunity under management and number of engagements 
service revenue opportunity under management 
at december   we estimated our opportunity under management to be over billion 
service revenue opportunity under management opportunity under management is a forward looking metric and is our estimate  as of a given date  of the value of all end customer service contracts that we will have the opportunity to sell on behalf of our customers over the subsequent twelve month period 
opportunity under management is not a measure of our expected revenue 
in addition  opportunity under management reflects our estimate for a forward twelve month period and should not be used to estimate our opportunity for any particular quarter within that period 
the value of end customer 
table of contents contracts actually delivered during a twelve month period should not be expected to occur in even quarterly increments due to seasonality and other factors impacting our customers and their end customers 
we estimate the value of such end customer contracts based on a combination of factors  including the value of end customer contracts made available to us by customers in past periods  the minimum value of end customer contracts that our customers are required to give us the opportunity to sell pursuant to the terms of their contracts with us  periodic internal business reviews of our expectations as to the value of end customer contracts that will be made available to us by customers  the value of end customer contracts included in the spa and collaborative discussions with our customers assessing their expectations as to the value of service contracts that they will make available to us for sale 
while the minimum value of end customer contracts that our customers are required to give us represents a portion of our estimated opportunity under management  a significant portion of the opportunity under management is estimated based on the other factors described above 
as our experience with our business  our customers and their contracts has grown  we have continually refined the process  improved the assumptions and expanded the data related to our calculation of opportunity under management 
when estimating service revenue opportunity under management  we must  to a large degree  rely on the assumptions described above  which may prove incorrect 
these assumptions are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
our estimates therefore may prove inaccurate  causing the actual value of end customer contracts delivered to us in a given twelve month period to differ from our estimate of opportunity under management 
these factors include the extent to which customers deliver a greater or lesser value of end customer contracts than may be required or otherwise expected  roll overs of unsold service contract renewals from prior periods to the current period or future periods  changes in the pricing or terms of service contracts offered by our customers  increases or decreases in the end customer base of our customers  the extent to which the renewal rates we achieve on behalf of a customer early in an engagement affect the amount of opportunity that the customer makes available to us later in the engagement  customer cancellations of their contracts with us  and changes in our customers businesses  sales organizations  management  sales processes or priorities 
our revenue also depends on our close rates and commissions 
our close rate is the percentage of opportunity under management that we renew on behalf of our customers 
our commission rate is an agreed upon percentage of the renewal value of end customer contracts that we sell on behalf of our customers 
our close rate is impacted principally by our ability to successfully sell service contracts on behalf of our customers 
other factors impacting our close rate include the manner in which our customers price their service contracts for sale to their end customers  the stage of life cycle associated with the products and underlying technologies covered by the service contracts offered to the end customer  the extent to which our customers or their competitors introduce new products or underlying technologies  the nature  size and age of the service contracts  and the extent to which we have managed the renewals process for similar products and underlying technologies in the past 
in determining commission rates for an individual engagement  various factors  including our close rates  as described above  are evaluated 
these factors include historical  industry specific and customer specific renewal rates for similar service contracts  the magnitude of the opportunity under management in a particular engagement  the number of end customers associated with these opportunities  and the opportunity to receive additional performance commissions when we exceed certain renewal levels 
we endeavor to set our commission rates at levels commensurate with these factors and other factors that may be relevant to a particular engagement 

table of contents accordingly  our commission rates vary  often significantly  from engagement to engagement 
in addition  we sometimes agree to lower commission rates for engagements with significant opportunity under management 
number of engagements 
we track the number of engagements we have with our customers 
we often have multiple engagements with a single customer  particularly where we manage the sales of service renewals relating to different product lines  technologies  types of contracts or geographies for the customer 
when the set of renewals we manage on behalf of a customer is associated with a separate customer contract or a distinct product set  type of end customer contract or geography and therefore requires us to assign a service sales team to manage the renewals  we designate the set of renewals  and associated revenues and costs to us as a unique engagement 
for example  we may have one engagement consisting of a service sales team selling maintenance contract renewals of a particular product for a customer in the united states and another engagement consisting of a sales team selling warranty contract renewals of a different product for the same customer in europe 
these would count as two engagements 
we had approximately  and engagements as of december   and  respectively 
factors affecting our performance sales cycle 
we sell our integrated solution through our sales organization 
at the beginning of the sales process  our quota carrying sales representatives contact prospective customers and educate them about our offerings 
educating prospective customers about the benefits of our solution can take time  as many of these prospects have not historically relied upon integrated solutions like ours for service revenue management  nor have they typically put out a formal request for proposal or otherwise made a decision to focus on this area 
as part of our sales process  we utilize our solutions design team to perform a service performance analysis spa of our prospect s service revenue 
the spa includes an analysis of best practices and benchmarks the prospect s service revenue against industry peers 
through the spa process  which typically takes several weeks  we are able to assess the characteristics and size of the prospect s service revenue  identify potential areas of performance improvement  and formulate our proposal for managing the prospect s service revenue 
the length of our sales cycle for a new customer  inclusive of the spa process and measured from our first formal discussion with the customer until execution of a new customer contract  is typically longer than six months and has increased in recent periods 
we generally contract with new customers to manage a specified portion of their service revenue opportunity  such as the opportunity associated with a particular product line or technology  contract type or geography 
we negotiate the engagement specific terms of our customer contracts  including commission rates  based on the output of the spa  including the areas identified for improvement 
once we demonstrate success to a customer with respect to the opportunity under contract  we seek to expand the scope of our engagement to include other opportunities with the customer 
for some customers  we manage all or substantially all of their service contract renewals 
implementation cycle 
after entering into an engagement with a new customer  and to a lesser extent after adding an engagement with an existing customer  we incur sales and marketing expenses related to the commissions owed to our sales personnel 
the commissions are based on the estimated total contract value  with a material portion of the commission expensed upfront with the remaining portion expensed over a period of eight to fourteen months 
we also make upfront investments in technology and personnel to support the engagement 
these expenses are typically incurred one to three months before we begin generating sales and recognizing revenue 
accordingly  in a given quarter  an increase in new customers  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in engagements with existing customers  or a significant increase in the contract value associated with such new customers and engagements  will negatively impact our gross margin and operating margins until we begin to achieve anticipated sales levels associated with the new engagements  which is typically two to three quarters after we begin selling contracts on behalf of our customers 
although we expect new customer engagements to contribute to our operating profitability over time  in the initial periods of a customer relationship  the near term impact on our profitability can be negatively impacted by 
table of contents slower than anticipated growth in revenues for these engagements as well as the impact of the upfront costs we incur  the lower initial level of associated service sales team productivity and lack of mature data and technology integration with the customer 
as a result  an increase in the mix of new customers as a percentage of total customers may initially have a negative impact on our operating results 
similarly  a decline in the ratio of new customers to total customers may positively impact our operating results 
contract terms 
substantially all of our revenue comes from our pay for performance model 
under our pay for performance model  we earn commissions based on the value of service contracts we sell on behalf of our customers 
in some cases  we earn additional performance based commissions for exceeding pre determined service renewal targets 
since  our new customer contracts have typically had a term of approximately months  although we sometimes have contract terms of up to months 
our contracts generally require our customers to deliver a minimum value of qualifying service revenue contracts for us to renew on their behalf during a specified period 
to the extent that our customers do not meet their minimum contractual commitments over a specified period  they may be subject to fees for the shortfall 
our customer contracts are cancelable on relatively short notice  subject in most cases to the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the amount of this fee is based on the length of the remaining term and value of the contract 
we invoice our customers on a monthly basis based on commissions we earn during the prior month  and with respect to performance based commissions  on a quarterly basis based on our overall performance during the prior quarter 
amounts invoiced to our customers are recognized as revenue in the period in which our services are performed or  in the case of performance commissions  when the performance condition is determinable 
because the invoicing for our services generally coincides with or immediately follows the sale of service contracts on behalf of our customers  we do not generate or report a significant deferred revenue balance 
however  the combination of minimum contractual commitments  our success in generating improved renewal rates for our customers  our customers historical renewal rates and the performance improvement potential identified by our spa process  provides us with revenue visibility 
m a activity 
our customers  particularly those in the technology sector  participate in an active environment for mergers and acquisitions 
large technology companies have maintained active acquisition programs to increase the breadth and depth of their product and service offerings and small and mid sized companies have combined to better compete with large technology companies 
a number of our customers have merged  purchased other companies or been acquired by other companies 
we expect merger and acquisition activity to continue to occur in the future 
the impact of these transactions on our business can vary 
acquisitions of other companies by our customers can provide us with the opportunity to pursue additional business to the extent the acquired company is not already one of our customers 
similarly  when a customer is acquired  we may be able to use our relationship with the acquired company to build a relationship with the acquirer 
in some cases we have been able to maintain our relationship with an acquired customer even where the acquiring company handles its other service contract renewals through internal resources 
in other cases  however  acquirers have elected to terminate or not renew our contract with the acquired company 
for example  oracle terminated our contracts with sun microsystems effective as of september  and had previously terminated our contract with another customer  bea systems  in april economic conditions and seasonality 
an improving economic outlook generally has a positive  but mixed  impact on our business 
as with most businesses  improved economic conditions can lead to increased end customer demand and sales 
in particular  within the technology sector  we believe that the recent economic downturn led many companies to cut their expenses by choosing to let their existing maintenance  support and subscription agreements lapse 
an improving economy may have the opposite effect 
however  an improving economy may also cause companies to purchase new hardware  software and other technology products  which we generally do not sell on behalf of our customers  instead of purchasing 
table of contents maintenance  support and subscription services for existing products 
to the extent this occurs  it would have a negative impact on our opportunities in the near term that would partially offset the benefits of an improving economy 
we believe the current uncertainty in the economy  combined with shifting market forces toward subscription based models  is impacting a number of our customers and prospective customers  particularly in the traditional enterprise software and hardware segments 
these forces have placed pressure on end customer demand for their renewal contracts and also have led to some slower decision making in general 
this economic and industry environment has adversely affected the conversion rates for end customers and contracts 
to the extent these conditions continue they will impact our future revenues 
certain new engagements we entered into in the fourth quarter of and during and have not yet fully ramped up to performance levels we anticipate achieving 
as a result  our revenues have not reflected  and are not expected in the first half of to reflect  the full revenue and operating margin potential from these customers 
in addition to the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment  we experience a seasonal variance in our revenue typically for the third quarter of the year as a result of lower or flat renewal volume corresponding to the timing of our customers product sales 
the impact of this seasonal fluctuation can be amplified if the economy as a whole is experiencing disruption or uncertainty  leading to deferral of some renewal decisions 
adoption of software as a service solutions 
within the software industry  there is a growing trend toward providing software to customers using a software as a service saas model 
under this model  saas companies provide access to software applications to customers on a remote basis  and provide their customers with a subscription to use the software  rather than licensing software to their customers 
saas companies face a distinct set of challenges with respect to customer renewals  given the potentially lower switching costs for customers utilizing their solutions  and are more reliant on renewals for their long term revenues than traditional software companies 
given the strategic importance of renewals to their model  saas companies may be less inclined than traditional software companies to rely on third party solutions such as ours to manage the sale of renewals of subscription contracts 
we have tailored our solution to address the needs of saas companies in this area and expect to continue to develop and enhance our solution as this market grows  especially with our renew ondemand application suite 
in connection with our purpose built saas offering to manage and maximize recurring revenue  we intend to significantly increase our investment in our customer support  training and professional services organizations to support deployments of renew ondemand 
we anticipate that the cost of providing professional services  support and training will be significant and that our gross profit will be adversely affected as we build out these functions 
basis of presentation net revenue substantially all of our net revenue is attributable to commissions we earn from the sale of renewals of maintenance  support and subscription agreements on behalf of our customers 
we generally invoice our customers for our services in arrears on a monthly basis for sales commissions  and on a quarterly basis for certain performance sales commissions  accordingly  we typically have no deferred revenue related to these services 
we do not set the price  terms or scope of services in the service contracts with end customers and do not have any obligations related to the underlying service contracts between our customers and their end customers 
we also earn revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our cloud based applications 
to date  subscription revenue has been insignificant 
however  we expect revenues generated from subscriptions to renew ondemand to increase in subscription fees are accounted for separately from commissions and they are billed on either a monthly or quarterly basis in advance and revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription term 

table of contents we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten customers in each period accounted for   and of our net revenue  respectively 
one customer accounted for more than of our revenues in  and and another customer represented more than of our revenues in our business is geographically diversified 
during  of our net revenue was earned in north america and latin america nala  in europe  middle east and africa emea and in asia pacific japan apj 
net revenue for a particular geography generally reflects commissions earned from sales of service contracts managed from our sales centers in that geography 
predominantly all of the service contracts sold and managed by our sales centers relate to end customers located in the same geography 
cost of revenue and gross profit our cost of revenue expenses include compensation  technology costs  including those related to the delivery of our cloud based solutions  and allocated overhead costs 
compensation includes salary  bonus  benefits and stock based compensation for our dedicated service sales teams 
our allocated overhead includes costs for facilities  information technology and depreciation  including amortization of internal use software associated with our service revenue technology platform and cloud applications 
allocated costs for facilities consist of rent  maintenance and compensation of personnel in our facilities departments 
our allocated costs for information technology include costs associated with third party data centers where we maintain our data servers  compensation of our information technology personnel and the cost of support and maintenance contracts associated with computer hardware and software 
to the extent our customer base or opportunity under management expands  we may need to hire additional service sales personnel and invest in infrastructure to support such growth 
we currently expect that our cost of revenue will fluctuate significantly and may increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue in the near term  including for the reasons discussed above under  factors affecting our performance implementation cycle and as a result of our near term plans to run dual technology platforms for several quarters as we commence the launch of renew ondemand while maintaining our existing technology platform 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of compensation and sales commissions for our sales and marketing staff  allocated expenses and marketing programs and events 
we sell our solutions through our global sales organization  which is organized across three geographic regions nala  emea and apj 
our commission plans provide that payment of commissions to our sales representatives is contingent on their continued employment  and we recognize expense over a period that is generally between twelve and fourteen months following the execution of the applicable contract 
we currently expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue in the near term based on commissions earned on customer contracts entered into in prior periods  as well as continued investments in sales and marketing personnel and programs as we expand our business domestically and internationally and pursue new sales initiatives 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation  allocated costs and the cost of third party service providers 
we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products  including renew ondemand  our next generation technology platform  and adding new features to our existing technology platform 
in connection with the development and enhancements of our saas applications  we capitalize certain expenditures related to the development and enhancement of internal use software related to our technology platform 
we expect research and development spending to increase on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue in the near term as we continue to invest in enhancement to our renew ondemand platform and our expectation that future capitalization of internal use software costs will be insignificant 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for our executive  human resources  finance and legal functions  and related expenses for professional fees for 
table of contents accounting  tax and legal services  as well as allocated expenses 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute basis to support our anticipated growth 
other income expense  net other income expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with borrowings under our credit facility  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and interest income 
income tax provision benefit we account for income taxes using an asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our taxable subsidiaries assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
we account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an income tax liability  if any  for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns 
to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate

our revenue performance was driven by a combination of growth in opportunity from new and existing customers  as well as strong performance across all of our service sales centers around the world in closing service revenue renewals 
the increase in number of customer engagements resulted from expansion of customer engagements with certain existing customers due to the success of our solution with these customers as well as new customer acquisitions due to our investments in our sales organization 
these increases were partially offset by a few customers in nala and apj where the scope of our services was reduced as well as the impact of customer terminations in emea in the last half of the increase in net revenue reflects revenue growth in all geographies  particularly nala and apj  due to an increase in the number and value of service contracts sold on behalf of our customers and the ramp of new engagements entered into in cost of revenue and gross profit years ended december  change change in thousands cost of revenue includes stock based compensation of gross profit gross profit percentage the increase in our cost of revenue in reflected an increase in the number of service sales and sales operational personnel  primarily in apj  resulting in a million increase in compensation and temporary labor  a million increase in allocated costs for facilities  including incremental facility costs related to an expansion of an existing facility  and greater costs for information technology and depreciation 
the decrease in our gross profit was driven primarily by the slower ramp of new customers added in the last half of and during  technology costs associated with hosting our cloud applications and lower margins from professional service engagements associated with the deployment of our cloud applications 
for the next several quarters  we expect that our spending will reflect increased amounts to support our legacy service revenue platform in addition to our renew ondemand application suite as well as increased spending on customer support and training to support future deployments of our cloud applications

the increase was partially offset by capitalization of million of internal labor and third party costs for development of internal use software in compared to million of capitalized costs in we expect research and development expenditures to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues as we continue to enhance renew ondemand and our expectations that there will be an insignificant amount of capitalized costs in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses in reflected a million increase in compensation due to an increase in headcount in the general and administrative functions across all geographic segments

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations and commitments our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and computer equipment 
at december   the future minimum payments under these commitments were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years obligations under capital leases operating lease obligations the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding  which specify significant terms  including payment terms  related services and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from recurring revenue management 
other revenues  which have not been significant  include subscriptions to our cloud applications and professional services 

table of contents revenue from recurring revenue management consists of fees earned from the sales of services contracts on behalf of our customers or assisting our customers in their sales process 
our contract obligations include administering and managing the sales and or renewal process for our customer s service contracts  providing adequately trained staff  reporting  and holding periodic business reviews with our customers 
under our contracts  customers are obligated to provide us with a detailed listing of sales prospects  access to their databases or management systems  and sales and marketing materials 
our fees are generally calculated as a fixed percentage of the overall sales value associated with the successful renewal of service contracts sold on behalf of our customers 
in addition  many of our customer contracts include performance based fees determined by the achievement of specified performance metrics 
our recurring revenue management contracts typically entitle us to additional fees and adjustments resulting from instances where our customers fail to provide us with a specified minimum value of contract renewals or they fail to provide contract renewal data within the time frames specified in our contract 
we also receive fees in the event a customer cancels a contract without cause prior to its terminations date 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured from customers and we have no significant or unfulfilled obligations 
customer contracts are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
our contracts are generally cancellable by our customers for convenience  subject to termination fees  or can be cancelled by our customers without a termination fee if we fail to achieve certain performance levels 
recurring revenue management services are deemed delivered when our customers accept purchased orders from their end customers and we have no significant remaining obligations 
our fees from recurring revenue management services are recognized on a net basis since we act as an agent on behalf of our customers 
we do not perform the underlying services  determine pricing  terms or scope of services to our customer s end users 
performance incentive fees and early termination fees are recorded in the period when the performance criteria have been met 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term  commencing when our cloud applications are made available to our customers 
professional services are deemed delivered and revenue recognized when project milestones have been achieved and accepted by the customer 
we have entered into a limited number of multiple element arrangements wherein our customers utilize a combination of recurring revenue management services  subscriptions to our cloud applications and professional services 
we separate deliverables at the inception of the arrangement as if each deliverable has stand alone value to our customer 
arrangement consideration is allocated based on the relative selling prices of each deliverable 
however  substantially all fees earned from our recurring revenue management services are contingent in nature as the commissions we earn are based on our performance against the specific terms of each contract 
therefore  contingent fees from revenue management services are excluded from the allocation of relative selling prices at inception of our multiple element arrangements 
selling prices for each deliverable is determined based on the selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence tpe  and best estimated selling price besp 
we have not been able to establish vsoe for our deliverables due to the customer specific nature of our products and services 
also  we have not been able to reliably determine the stand alone selling prices of competitor s products and services  and as a result  we cannot rely on tpe for our deliverables 
therefore  we utilize estimates of besp to determine the selling prices of our deliverables 
besp is determined through consultation with management  taking into consideration our marketing and pricing strategies 
as these strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in the estimates used to estimate besp which could change the allocation of revenue for our multiple element arrangements 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock units  based on the grant date fair values of the awards 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price using historical volatility and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
the compensation expense of restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  and the expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
capitalized internal use software our software development costs relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our technology platforms  atlas and renew ondemand 
software development costs include employee salaries  benefits and third party contractor fees 
research and development costs  relating principally to the design and development of new products prior to the application development stage and the routine enhancement  and maintenance of existing products  are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize certain internal and external costs related to the development and enhancement of our internal use software when we enter the application development stage and until software is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use 
these capitalized costs include direct external costs of services utilized in developing or obtaining internal use software  compensation and related expenses of employees who are directly associated with  and who devote substantive time to  internal use software projects 
capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
the related costs are amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from to months 
capitalized internal use software development costs for projects not yet complete are included as construction in progress 
we initiate our review of potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the capitalized internal use software may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of the internal use software is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
there were no impairments to internal use software in  or income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our taxable subsidiaries assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning 
table of contents strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
we account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an income tax liability  if any  for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns 
to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
the reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate
