in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a  part i  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
we do not guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
overview revenues increased to million in compared to million as a result of increased sales in our probes segment 
income from continuing operations was million in compared to a loss from continuing operations in of million 
the loss from continuing operations in included the following charges in thousands restructuring charges factory moving and other project costs outlook for we begin coming off a record year for cascade microtech 
our revenue growth during of compared to was driven by demand for our probes products 
looking forward to  we expect continued growth as it appears that industry demand forecasted for our products will improve over the levels achieved in restructuring charges during  we took actions to reduce our overall cost structure 
we recorded restructuring charges in connection with employee severance benefits 
we also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities  net of estimated sublease income that we believe could be reasonably obtained 
if the real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional charges will be recognized in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit will be recognized 
we had no new restructuring charges in discontinued operations on september   we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to our sockets operations to r d sockets  inc for  in cash and a note receivable from the buyer for  which was paid in december in connection with the transaction  the buyer assumed our obligations under the lease agreement covering administrative offices and a manufacturing facility related to our sockets business

table of contents systems certain financial information which contributed to the systems revenue results was as follows compared to compared to percentage increase decrease in station unit sales percentage increase decrease in average sales price asp the decrease in systems revenue in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in asp as we sold fewer higher end mm and special application systems 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in unit sales of lower priced mm and mm stations 
the increase in systems revenue in compared to was the result of an increase in asp  offset partially by a decrease in unit sales of more compact mm manual stations 
asp in compared to asp in was positively affected by changes in sales mix  as a larger number of higher end mm and special application stations were sold relative to total unit sales 
sales of mm  cryogenic and high power systems collectively represented  and of total systems unit sales in  and  respectively 
probes the increase in probes revenue in compared to was primarily the result of increased unit sales of our engineering probes and production probe cards due to an increase in market share and customer demand 
the increase in probes revenue in compared to was primarily the result of higher unit sales of our production probe cards and engineering probes 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test  installation labor  overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
cost of sales information was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change cost of sales systems probes total year ended december  dollar change change cost of sales systems probes total cost of sales was affected by changes in sales as discussed above combined with the factors that caused fluctuations in our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue  as discussed below 

table of contents gross margins were as follows year ended december  gross margins systems probes overall systems the increase in systems gross margins in compared to was primarily due to decreased factory costs following our factory consolidation and restructuring activities during the second and third quarters of the increase in systems gross margins in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in inventory valuation charges 
inventory valuation charges totaled million in  primarily related to restructuring charges following our acquisition of suss test in january  compared to million in in addition  included million of purchase price allocation adjustments to value finished goods and work in process inventory acquired in connection with the suss test acquisition at their estimated selling price less cost to sell 
accordingly  when such inventory was sold  it resulted in near zero gross margins 
factory consolidation costs of approximately million were included in gross margin for other changes were attributable to sales mix  as a larger number of high end systems were sold in probes the increase in probes gross margins in compared to was primarily due to higher sales volumes  which resulted in lower unallocated fixed overhead costs recorded as period expenses in cost of sales 
the increase in probes gross margins in compared to was primarily due to decreased factory costs and higher sales volumes  which resulted in lower unallocated fixed overhead costs recorded as period expenses in cost of sales 
overall the overall increase in gross margins in compared to was attributable to the increase in gross margin of both operating segments 
overall changes in gross margins from to are primarily attributable to changes in systems gross margin as that segment represented greater than two thirds of total revenue and cost of sales in and research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
information regarding our research and development expense was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change research and development year ended december  dollar change change research and development 
table of contents the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily due to decreases in employee compensation 
the decrease in employee compensation was driven by decreases in headcount and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expense was flat in compared to as a result of a million increase in salary  benefits and incentive compensation being offset by a million increase in government grant reimbursements and a million decrease in project related expenses 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  manufacturers representative commissions  internally developed patent and trademark amortization and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company

the increase in compared to was primarily due to a million increase in restructuring charges and a million increase in salary  benefits and incentive compensation  partially offset by a million decrease in internal and external commissions due to changes in commissions programs and sales mix  and a million decrease in professional fees primarily due to the expense recognized in from the acquisition of suss test in january restructuring charges included in sg a during related to the abandonment of excess leased facilities in connection with the consolidation of our manufacturing operations and our corporate headquarters 
restructuring charges included in sg a in included charges related to our acquisition of suss test and the reorganization of our sockets business in minnesota  and primarily included termination and severance related charges 
other income expense other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense may also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 
other income expense  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  interest income  net foreign currency gains losses gains losses on foreign currency forward contracts other 
table of contents interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from a combination of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the net value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in yen  euro and other foreign currencies 
income taxes information regarding our income tax expense was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  income tax provision related to continuing operations income tax provision as a percentage of income loss from continuing operations generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates and changes in tax reserves 
our income tax provision primarily represents the estimated current tax expense on income in foreign tax jurisdictions  offset by a deferred tax benefit related to reserves and allowances in foreign jurisdictions 
our income tax provision primarily represents the estimated current tax expense on income in foreign tax jurisdictions  offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to a prior year tax position 
our income tax provision included tax expense due to taxable income in foreign tax jurisdictions  offset by a net benefit in germany that primarily related to the release of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of suss test in january liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was million and primarily consisted of our net income of million  net non cash expenses of million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable  net decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to improved collections of customer receivables 
inventories increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in inventory was primarily due to increased purchases of raw materials and build up of finished goods in preparation for orders expected to ship during the first half of this increase was partially offset by inventory charges of million in for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our actual results are significantly different than our current expectations for  we may incur additional charges to write down inventory in future periods 
prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to collection of value added tax vat receivables 
deferred revenue decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily due to a decrease in customer deposits 

table of contents accrued liabilities decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily due to decreases in accrued income taxes  sales taxes and vat 
other long term liabilities decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily due to the decrease in accrued lease abandonment costs 
fixed asset purchases of million in primarily related to production related equipment 
we anticipate fixed asset additions for to be approximately million  primarily for production related equipment  facility improvements  research and development tools  business information systems and information technology equipment 
in february  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of our common stock could be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during the period through june  pursuant to this plan  a total of  shares were repurchased at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million 
in november  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to million of our common stock could be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
through december   a total of  shares were repurchased at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million 
as of december   million remained available for repurchases 
this plan does not have an expiration date 
changes in our assets and liabilities as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows do not equal the changes in such assets and liabilities as calculated for our consolidated balance sheets due to the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which totaled million at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  includes earnings of million at foreign subsidiaries that is permanently reinvested 
we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisition and expansion and any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our cash and marketable securities or may result in the issuance by us of debt or equity securities 
issuances of debt securities would increase our leverage and interest exposure  issuances of equity securities could dilute the ownership interest of equity shareholders 
seasonality typically  our first quarter revenues are lower than our revenues from the preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
however  our seasonality can be affected by general economic trends and it should not be expected that historical revenue patterns will continue 

table of contents contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases purchase order commitments forward contracts purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have become increasingly difficult to make in the current economic environment 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers and distributors that do not have special acceptance criteria is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the price is fixed and determinable  the product is shipped  title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products with origin terms 
for any shipments with destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have special acceptance criteria is not recognized until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  is recognized when the services are performed 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components products  accessories  installation services  training and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in collectability 
the current economic environment has increased both the risk of bad debt and the difficulty in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost  computed on a first in  first out basis or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against 
table of contents the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory reserve charges are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales and create a new cost basis for the inventory 
goodwill impairment goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if a triggering event occurs 
we first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we then perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value  and  if an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill as determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
goodwill of million at december  and relates to our acquisition of suss test in january this goodwill relates to our systems segment and represents the value of assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition 
our goodwill assessment performed in the fourth quarter of  and did not indicate impairment of goodwill 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including our intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of discounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
during  we recorded million of write downs to property and equipment in connection with our restructuring activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges for long lived assets during or warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management cannot reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in  we decreased our valuation allowance by million related to decreases in deferred tax assets  primarily the utilization of nol carryforwards 
in  we increased our valuation allowance by million related to increases in deferred tax assets 
in  we increased our valuation allowance by million  which included increases for changes in our net deferred tax assets during 
table of contents  partially offset by a million reduction of our valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in germany in connection with our acquisition of suss test in january the valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   we had net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
our gross federal nol carryforward  before valuation allowance  totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in our financial statements if we determine that the positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within our financial statements 
at december   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of million 
all unrecognized tax benefits would have an impact on the effective tax rate if recognized 
the interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
recent accounting guidance see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward currency exchange contracts 
the purpose of these contracts is to reduce the risk that our earnings and future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific receivables or payables 
as of december   we had forward contracts outstanding for japanese yen and euro totaling approximately million  which mature through june historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

table of contents our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
based on the nature of our marketable securities  a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income  but would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur 
in addition  due to the nature of our marketable securities and cash equivalents  a decline in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our marketable securities or cash equivalents
