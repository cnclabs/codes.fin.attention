operations we have developed our website and related infrastructure with the goal of maximizing the availability of our platform to our members  enterprises and professional organizations 
our website and related infrastructure are hosted on a network located in multiple third party facilities 
our material data center facilities are provided by equinix operating co  inc equinix pursuant to a master service agreement with equinix dated february under this agreement  equinix provides us with data center space in various locations 
intellectual property we protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights  as well as contractual restrictions 
we control access to our proprietary technology  in part  by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
in addition to these contractual arrangements  we also rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark  trade dress  domain name and patents to protect our intellectual property 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states 
our registered trademarks in the united states include linkedin and the in design mark  as well as others  and as of december   we owned or had licenses to seven issued us patents related to online networking  which expire between and  and patent applications on file in the united states and internationally 
circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights 
for example  effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the united states or other countries in which our products and solutions are distributed 
also  the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective 
any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete 
also  protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming 
any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results 
companies in the internet  social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents  copyrights  and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements  threaten litigation  or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we face  and we expect to face in the future  allegations that we have infringed the trademarks  copyrights  patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  including our competitors and non practicing entities 
as we face increasing competition and as our business grows  we will likely face more intellectual property claims 
competition we face significant competition in all aspects of our business 
specifically  we compete for members  enterprises and professional organizations  the bases upon which we compete differ among these areas as discussed below 
members professional networks 
the market for online professional networks is new and rapidly evolving 
other companies such as facebook  google  microsoft and twitter are developing or could develop competing solutions 
further  some of these companies are partnering with third parties to offer products and services that could compete with ours 
we face competition from a number of smaller companies in international markets  such as xing in germany and viadeo in france  that provide online professional networking solutions  as well as internet companies in the customer relationship management market  such as salesforce 
com chatter and jigsaw 
additionally  we compete against smaller companies that focus on groups of professionals within a specific vertical or industry 
because membership on our website is available at no cost  we don t compete for members on the basis of price 
instead  we compete primarily on the basis of the value and relevance of the products for professionals  ease of use and availability of our website and our products and solutions  and the total number of professional members and relevant data available 
enterprises and professional organizations talent solutions 
with respect to our talent solutions  we compete with established online recruiting companies such as monster  careerbuilder  and indeed 
com and larger companies 
table of contents that are focusing on talent management and human resource services  such as oracle through its acquisition of taleo  sap through its acquisition of successfactors and ibm through its acquisition of kenexa  and traditional recruiting firms 
additionally  other companies  including newcomers to the recruiting industry  may partner with internet companies  including social networking companies  to provide services that compete with our solutions  either on their own or as third party applications  such as branchout 
in this area  we compete primarily on the basis of the efficiency and usefulness of our solutions for enterprises and professional organizations  which are influenced by the number and engagement of our members 
enterprises and professional organizations advertising and marketing 
with respect to our marketing solutions  we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers 
in this area  we compete to attract and retain advertisers by giving them access to the most relevant and targeted audiences for their products or services 
other companies that provide content for professionals could develop more compelling offerings that compete with our premium subscriptions and adversely impact our ability to sell and renew subscriptions to our members 
additionally  companies that currently focus primarily on social networking could expand into professional networking or users of social networks could choose to use  or increase the use of  those networks for professional networking 
we believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably in our markets 
however  our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive 
larger and more established companies may focus on professional networking and could directly compete with us 
smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly 
government regulation we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online  many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business 
in the united states and abroad  laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims  including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts  unfair competition  copyright and trademark infringement  and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched  the ads posted  or the content provided by users 
any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business 
in addition  rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct  such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information  money laundering or supporting terrorist activities may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our products or services  restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our service 
in the area of information security and data protection  most states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data  such as the amendment to california information practices act  or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement 
the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation 
furthermore  any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities 
we are also subject to federal  state  and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of member data 
we post on our website our privacy policy and user agreement  which describe our practices concerning the use  transmission and disclosure of member data 
any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others  which could harm our business 
in addition  the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws  and their application to the internet is unclear  evolving and in a state of flux 
there is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state  country to country  or region to region  and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices  or that new regulations will be enacted 
complying with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices 
further  any failure by us to adequately protect our members privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of members and customers  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  certain foreign jurisdictions have claimed and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws  including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity  employees  or infrastructure

some of our significant new products have been developed as a result of indays and hackdays 
information about segment and geographic revenue information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
seasonality our business is affected by both  cyclicality in business activity  and seasonal fluctuations in internet usage 
we believe our rapid growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business 
as our revenue growth rate slows  we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our business may become more pronounced and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate 
in particular  we expect sales of talent solutions to be weaker in the first quarter of the year due to budgetary cycles and sales of our marketing solutions to be weaker in the third quarter of the year as internet usage during the summer months generally slows

risk factors investing in our class a common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes  before deciding whether to purchase shares of our class a common stock 
if any of the following risks are realized  our business  operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in that event  the price of our class a common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history in a new and unproven market  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful 
we have a limited operating history in a new and unproven market that may not develop as expected  if at all 
this limited operating history makes it difficult to effectively assess or forecast our future prospects 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter or may encounter in this rapidly evolving market 
these risks and difficulties include our ability to  among other things hire  integrate and retain world class talent  continue to earn and preserve our members trust with respect to their professional reputation and information  develop a scalable  high performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased member usage globally while also implementing appropriate localization  as well as the deployment of new features and products  increase our number of registered members and member engagement  responsibly use the data that our members share with us to provide solutions that make our members more productive and successful and that are critical to the talent  marketing and sales needs of enterprises and professional organizations  process  store  protect and use personal data in compliance with governmental regulation  contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security  halt the operations of websites that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies  or copycat websites that have misappropriated our data  avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service or slower than expected load times for our services  increase revenue from the solutions we provide  successfully adapt to mobile markets and optimize services for mobile devices  successfully expand our business  especially internationally  successfully compete with other companies that are currently in  or may in the future enter  the online professional network space  and defend ourselves against litigation  regulatory  intellectual property  privacy or other claims 

table of contents if the market for online professional networks does not develop as we expect  or if we fail to address the needs of this market  our business will be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties or others  including those described elsewhere in these risk factors 
failure to adequately address these risks and difficulties could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
we may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our services and solutions are accessible within an acceptable load time 
additionally  natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences beyond our control could interfere with access to our services 
a key element to our continued growth is the ability of our members  users whom we define as anyone who visits one of our websites through a computer or application on a mobile device  regardless of whether or not they are a member  enterprises and professional organizations in all geographies to access our websites  services and solutions within acceptable load times 
we call this website performance 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  service disruptions  outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors  including infrastructure changes  human or software errors  capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our services simultaneously  and denial of service or fraud or security attacks 
in some instances  we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time 
it may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our website performance  especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases 
if our services are unavailable when users attempt to access them or they do not load as quickly as users expect  they may seek other websites or services to obtain the information for which they are looking  and may not return to our website or use our services as often in the future  or at all 
this would negatively impact our ability to attract members  enterprises and professional organizations and increase engagement of our members and users 
we expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and products 
to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints  upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology  our business and operating results may be harmed 
we have implemented a disaster recovery program  which allows us to move production to a back up data center in the event of a catastrophe 
although this program is functional  it does not yet provide a real time back up data center  so if our primary data center shuts down  there will be a period of time that our services will remain shut down while the transition to the back up data center takes place 
our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks and similar events 
our us corporate offices and certain of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the san francisco bay area and southern california  both regions known for seismic activity 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses  including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
if our security measures are compromised  or if our websites are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members or customers to access our solutions  or if our member data is compromised  members and customers may curtail or stop use of our solutions 
our solutions involve the collection  processing  storage  sharing  disclosure and usage of members and customers information and communications  some of which may be private 
we are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  phishing attacks  attempts to overload our servers with denial of service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems  any of which could lead to interruptions  delays  or website shutdowns  causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or other confidential information  such as credit card information 
for example  in june  we learned that approximately million of our members encrypted passwords were stolen and published on an unauthorized website 
if we experience compromises to our security that result in website performance or availability problems  the complete shutdown of our websites  or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  our members or customers may be harmed or lose trust and confidence in us  and decrease the use of our website and services or stop using our services in their entirety  we could be subject to liability and litigation  and we would suffer reputational and financial harm 
additionally  we are  and in the future could be  subject to regulatory investigations and litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue  and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches 
for example  we work with third party vendors to process credit card payments by our customers and are subject to payment card association operating rules 
if our security measures fail to protect this information adequately or we fail to 
table of contents comply with the applicable operating rules  we could be liable to both our customers for their losses  as well as the vendors under our agreements with them  we could be subject to fines and higher transaction fees  we could face regulatory action  and our customers and vendors could end their relationships with us  any of which could harm our business and financial results 
unauthorized parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees  members or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or our members or customers information or access this information through other means  or abuse our systems in ways that otherwise degrade our users experience with linkedin  such as sending numerous unsolicited emails 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems change frequently  often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world  we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new members and increase engagement by existing members  cause existing members to close their accounts or existing customers to cancel their contracts  subject us to third party lawsuits  regulatory fines or other action or liability  thereby harming our operating results 
our core value of putting our members first may conflict with the short term interests of our business 
one of our core values is to make decisions based on the best interests of our members  which we believe is essential to our success in increasing our member growth rate and engagement and in serving the best  long term interests of the company and our stockholders 
therefore  in the past  we have forgone  and may in the future forgo  certain expansion or short term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of our members  even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term 
in addition  as part of our philosophy of putting our members first  as long as our members are adhering to our terms of service  this philosophy may cause disagreements  or negatively impact our relationships  with our existing or prospective customers 
this could result in enterprises and professional organizations blocking access to our services or refusing to purchase our talent or marketing solutions or premium subscriptions 
our decisions may not result in the long term benefits that we expect  in which case our member engagement  business and operating results could be harmed 
the number of our registered members is higher than the number of actual members and a substantial majority of our page views are generated by a minority of our members 
our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and retain additional members who actively use our services 
in addition  the tracking of certain of our performance metrics is done with internal tools and is not independently verified 
the number of registered members in our network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations  other members have died or become incapacitated  and others may have registered under fictitious names 
given the challenges inherent in identifying these accounts  we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual members  and thus we rely on the number of registered members as our measure of the size of our network 
further  a substantial majority of our members do not visit our website on a monthly basis  and a substantial majority of our page views are generated by a minority of our members 
if the number of our actual members does not meet our expectations  if the rate at which we add new members slows or declines or if we are unable to increase the breadth and frequency of our visiting members  then our business may not grow as fast as we expect 
in addition  we track certain performance metrics with internal tools  which are not independently verified by any third party 
the information and the tracking have a number of limitations 
if our internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance  the data we report may not be accurate 
this may harm our operating and financial results and may cause our stock price to decline 
if our members profiles are out of date  inaccurate or lack the information that users and customers want to see  we may not be able to realize the full potential of our network  which could adversely impact the growth of our business 
if our members do not update their information or provide accurate and complete information when they join linkedin or do not establish sufficient connections  the value of our network may be negatively impacted because our value proposition as a professional network and as a source of accurate and comprehensive data will be weakened 
for example  customers of our talent solutions formerly hiring solutions may not find members that meet their qualifications or may misidentify a candidate as having such qualifications  which could result in mismatches that erode customer confidence in our solutions 
similarly  incomplete or outdated member information would diminish the ability of our marketing solutions customers to reach their target audiences and our ability to provide our customers with valuable insights 
therefore  we must provide features and products that demonstrate the value of our network to our members and motivate them to contribute additional  timely and accurate information to their profile and our network 
if we fail to successfully motivate our members to do so  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents we collect  process  store  share  disclose and use personal information and other data  which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy  and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 
we collect  process  store  share  disclose and use information about our members and users  including personal information and other data  and we enable our members to passively and proactively share their personal information with each other and with third parties and to communicate and share news and other information into and across our platform 
there are numerous federal  state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection  storing  sharing  using  processing  disclosing and protecting of personal information and other member data  the scope of which are changing  subject to differing interpretations  and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules 
we generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy related obligations to third parties including voluntary third party certification bodies such as truste 
we strive to comply with all applicable laws  policies  legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection  to the extent possible 
however  it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways and or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted 
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies  our privacy related obligations to users or other third parties  or our privacy related legal obligations  or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information  which may include personally identifiable information or other member data  may result in governmental enforcement actions  litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our members and customers to lose trust in us  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  if third parties we work with  such as customers  vendors or developers  violate applicable laws or our policies  such violations may also put our members information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business 
public scrutiny of internet privacy issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards  which could deter or prevent us from providing our current products and solutions to our members and customers  thereby harming our business 
the regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future 
practices regarding the collection  use  storage  display  processing  transmission and security of personal information by companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny 
the us government  including the white house  the federal trade commission and the department of commerce  are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services  including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices 
the ftc in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number on line  social media companies 
similar actions may also impact linkedin directly 
the white house recently published a report calling for a consumer privacy bill of rights that could impact the collection of data  and the department of commerce seeks to establish a consensus driven do not track standard that could impact on line and mobile advertising 
in addition  the european union is in the process of promulgating a new general data protection regulation  which would apply across the entire eu and may result in significantly greater compliance burdens for companies with users and operations in europe 
various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 
recently  the state of california and several other states have adopted privacy guidelines with respect to mobile application 
our business  including our ability to operate and expand internationally  could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted  interpreted  or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices  the design of our websites  mobile applications  products  features or our privacy policy 
in particular  the success of our business has been  and we expect will continue to be  driven by our ability to responsibly use the data that our members share with us 
therefore  our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws  regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the use or disclosure of data our members choose to share with us  or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained 
such changes may require us to modify our products and features  possibly in a material manner  and may limit our ability to develop new products and features that make use of the data that we collect about our members 
our business is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws  many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of laws in the united states and abroad  including laws regarding privacy  data protection  data security  data retention and consumer protection and the provision of online payment services that are continuously evolving and developing 
the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting  particularly laws outside the united states 
for example  laws relating to the liability of providers of online 
table of contents services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims  including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts  unfair competition  copyright and trademark infringement  and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched  the ads posted  or the content provided by users 
in addition  regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection and other matters that may be applicable to our business 
it is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our solutions are used in a greater number of countries  we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions 
further  as our services and solutions expand to include more content  additional laws and regulations may become applicable to our products and offerings 
users of our site and our solutions could also abuse or misuse our products in ways that violate laws 
it is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws to which we may become subject 
if we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations  we could be directly harmed  and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions  which would negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business 
any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results 
many individuals are using devices other than personal computers to access online services 
if users of these devices do not widely adopt solutions we develop for these devices  our business could be adversely affected 
the number of people who access online services through devices other than personal computers  including smart phones  handheld tablets and mobile telephones has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase 
if the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet the needs of our users  users may reduce their usage of our platform and our business could suffer 
additionally  as new devices and new platforms are continually being released  it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices  and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation  support  and maintenance of such devices 
growth in access to linkedin services through mobile devices as a substitute for access on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results 
because access to online services through mobile devices is growing  our members are increasingly accessing linkedin on mobile devices 
while many of our members who use our online services on mobile devices also access linkedin through personal computers  as we have developed our mobile solutions  we have seen substantial growth in mobile usage  and we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to grow 
advertising is a source of revenue for us  and it is not clear that we will be able find ways for our marketing solutions product to be effectively used on mobile devices 
accordingly  if our members increasingly use mobile devices as a substitute for access to our online services as opposed to personal computers  and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our solutions on mobile devices  if these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers  or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort  our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis  which may result in a decline in our stock price if such fluctuations result in a failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and may fail to match our past performance because of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control 
any of these events could cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate 
factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include our ability to increase our member base and member engagement  disruptions or outages in the availability of our websites or services  actual or perceived breaches of privacy  and compromises of our member data  our commitment to putting our members first even if it means forgoing short term revenue opportunities  shifts in the way members and users access our websites and services from personal computers to mobile devices  the unproven nature of our business model  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  our ability to increase sales of our products and solutions to new customers and expand sales of additional products and solutions to our existing customers  the size and seasonal variability of our customers recruiting and marketing budgets  the extent to which existing customers renew their agreements with us and the timing and terms of those renewals  
table of contents macroeconomic changes  in particular  deterioration in labor markets  which would adversely impact sales of our talent solutions  or economic growth that does not lead to job growth  for instance increases in productivity  the cost of investing in our technology infrastructure  product initiatives and international expansion may be greater than we anticipate  expenses related to hiring and retaining employees  the timing and costs of expanding our field sales organization and delays or inability in achieving expected productivity  the timing of certain expenditures  including hiring of employees and capital expenditures  the entrance of new competitors in our market whether by established companies or the entrance of new companies  and general industry and macroeconomic conditions 
given our limited operating history and the rapidly evolving market of online professional networks  our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results 
we believe our rapid growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business 
as our revenue growth rate slows  we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our business may become more pronounced and may in the future cause our operating results to fluctuate 
in particular  we expect sales of talent solutions to be weaker in the first quarter of the year due to budgetary cycles and sales of our marketing solutions to be weaker in the third quarter of the year as use of online services during the summer months generally slows 
in addition  global economic concerns continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability and add risk to our future outlook 
sovereign debt issues and economic uncertainty in the united states  europe and around the world raise concerns in markets important to our business 
an economic downturn in any particular region in which we do business or globally could result in reductions in sales of our talent solutions and marketing solutions  decreased renewals of existing arrangements and other adverse effects that could harm our operating results 
we expect our revenue growth rate to decline  and  as our costs increase  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability over the long term 
from to  our annual net revenue grew from million to million  which represents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
as our net revenue has increased to higher levels  our revenue growth rate has slowed  and we expect that it will continue to decline over time 
we also expect that the growth rates of each of our three primary business lines will fluctuate and the business lines may not grow at the same rate 
as with  our philosophy in is to continue to invest for future growth 
we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on our technology infrastructure  including architecture  development tools scalability  availability  performance and security  as well as disaster recovery measures  product development  including investments in our product development team and the development of new features for both members and customers  sales and marketing  including a significant expansion of our field sales organization  international expansion in an effort to increase our member base  engagement and sales  and general administration  including legal and accounting expenses related to being a public company with an expanding global presence 
these investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business  and will increase our expenses 
if we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business  our operating results and business would be harmed 
we expect to face increasing competition in the market for online professional networks from social networking sites and internet search companies  among others  as well as continued competition for customers of our talent solutions and marketing solutions 
we face significant competition in all aspects of our business  and we expect such competition to increase  particularly in the market for online professional networks 
our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive 
larger and more established companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us 
smaller companies  including application developers  could also launch new products and services that compete with us and that could gain market acceptance quickly 
we also expect our existing competitors in the markets for talent solutions and marketing solutions to continue to focus on these areas 
a number of these companies may have greater resources than us  which may enable them to compete more effectively 
additionally  users of social networks may choose to use  or increase their use of  those networks for professional purposes  which may result in those users decreasing or eliminating their use of linkedin 
companies that currently focus on social networking could also expand their focus to professionals 
we and other companies have historically established alliances and relationships with some of these companies to allow broader exposure to users and access to data on the internet 
we may also  in the future  establish 
table of contents alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors 
to the extent companies terminate such relationships and establish alliances and relationships with others  our business could be harmed 
specifically  we compete for members  enterprises and professional organizations as discussed below 
members professional networks 
the market for online professional networks is new and rapidly evolving 
other companies such as facebook  google  microsoft and twitter are developing or could develop competing solutions 
further  some of these companies are partnering with third parties to offer products and services that could compete with ours 
we face competition from a number of smaller companies in international markets  such as xing in germany and viadeo in france  that provide online professional networking solutions  as well as internet companies in the customer relationship management market  such as salesforce 
com chatter and jigsaw 
additionally  we compete against smaller companies that focus on groups of professionals within a specific industry or vertical 
our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of members and customers  such as mobile access 
any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure  loss of market share or decreased member engagement  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely affect our ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results 
enterprises and professional organizations talent solutions 
with respect to our talent solutions  we compete with established online recruiting companies  such as monster  careerbuilder  and indeed 
com  talent management companies and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services  such as oracle through its acquisition of taleo  sap through its acquisition of successfactors and ibm through its acquisition of kenexa  and traditional recruiting firms 
additionally  other companies  including newcomers to the recruiting industry  may partner with internet companies  including social networking companies  to provide services that compete with our solutions  either on their own or as third party applications  such as branchout 
if the efficiency and usefulness of our products to enterprises and professional organizations do not continue to exceed those provided by competitors  which factors are influenced by the number and engagement of our members  we will not be able to compete successfully 
enterprises and professional organizations marketing solutions 
with respect to our marketing solutions  we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers 
to the extent competitors are better able to provide customers with cost effective access to attractive demographics  either through new business models or increased user volume  we may not be successful in retaining our existing advertisers or attracting new advertisers  and our business would be harmed 
finally  other companies that provide content for professionals could develop more compelling offerings that compete with our premium subscriptions and adversely impact our ability to sell and renew subscriptions to our members 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations  which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure 
as of december   approximately of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately for less than two years 
as we continue to grow  we must effectively integrate  develop and motivate a large number of new employees in various countries around the world  and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture 
in particular  we intend to continue to make substantial investments to expand our engineering  research and development  field sales  and general and administrative organizations  and our international operations 
to attract top talent  we have had to offer  and believe we will need to continue to offer  highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees 
we face significant competition for talent from other internet and high growth companies  which include both publicly traded and privately held companies 
as we have transitioned from a private company to a public company  this competition has become even more acute in assessing appropriate compensation packages  particularly  determining the mix of cash and equity compensation 
the risks of over hiring especially given overall macroeconomic risks or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base into our corporate culture are exacerbated by our international expansion  and because of our growth  we have significantly expanded our operating lease commitments  which has increased our expenses 
additionally  we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs 
if we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires  our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale  productivity and retention could suffer  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
additionally  if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations  the quality of our solutions could suffer  which could negatively affect our brand  operating results and overall business 
further  we have made changes in the past  and will in the future make changes  to our features  products and services that our members or customers may not like  find useful or agree with 
we may also decide to discontinue certain features  products or services  or charge for certain features  products or services that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features  products or services 
if members or 
table of contents customers are unhappy with these changes  they may decrease their engagement on our site  or stop using features  products or services or the site generally 
they may  in addition  choose to take other types of action against us such as organizing petitions or boycotts focused on our company  our website or any of our services  filing claims with the government or other regulatory bodies  or filing lawsuits against us 
any of these actions could negatively impact our member growth and engagement and our brand  which would harm our business 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  and our reporting systems and procedures by  among other things improving our information technology infrastructure to maintain the effectiveness of our solutions  enhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of members  enterprises and professional organizations  enhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations  and appropriately documenting our information technology systems and our business processes 
these systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources 
if we fail to implement these improvements effectively  our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired 
our international operations are subject to increased challenges and risks 
we have offices around the world and our websites and mobile applications are available in numerous other languages 
we expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future by opening offices in new jurisdictions and expanding our offerings in new languages 
however  we have limited operating history as a company outside the united states  and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages  cultures  customs  legal systems  alternative dispute systems  regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures 
international expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources 
operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face  including risks associated with recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices  providing solutions across a significant distance  in different languages and among different cultures  including potentially modifying our solutions and features to ensure that they are culturally relevant in different countries  which may include modifying content in certain jurisdictions if it may be considered objectionable  increased competition from local websites and services  that provide online professional networking solutions  such as germany based xing and france based viadeo  and online recruitment services  such as australia based seek and japan based recruit  who have and may continue to expand their geographic footprint  differing and potentially lower levels of member growth and engagement in new and nascent geographies  compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations  including potential risk of penalties to individual members of management if our practices are deemed to be out of compliance  longer payment cycles in some countries  credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud  compliance with anti bribery laws including  without limitation  compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk anti bribery act  currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the united states  foreign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations and bank accounts before monetizing certain geographic territories  political and economic instability in some countries  specifically in ireland  double taxation of our non us earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the united states or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate  and higher costs of doing business internationally 
if our revenue from our international operations  and particularly from our operations in the countries and regions on which we have focused our spending  do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our business and operating results will suffer 
in addition  as our member base expands internationally  members in certain geographies may have lower levels of engagement with our website and services 

table of contents our business depends on a strong and trusted brand  and any failure to maintain  protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of members  enterprises and professional organizations  our ability to increase their level of engagement and our ability to attract and retain high level employees 
we have developed a strong and trusted brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business 
our brand is predicated on the idea that individual professionals will trust us and find immense value in building and maintaining their professional identities and reputations on our platform 
if our members or potential members determine that they can use other platforms  such as social networks  for the same purposes as or as a replacement for our network  or if they choose to blend their professional and social networking activities  our brand and our business could be harmed 
maintaining  protecting and enhancing the linkedin brand is critical to expanding our base of members  enterprises  advertisers  corporate customers and other partners  and increasing their engagement with our services  and will depend largely on our ability to maintain member trust  be a technology leader and continue to provide high quality solutions  which we may not do successfully 
for example  members or customers could find that new products or features that we introduce are difficult to use or may feel that they degrade their experience on linkedin  which could harm our reputation for delivering high quality products 
our brand is also important in attracting and maintaining high performing employees 
if we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand  our business could be harmed 
we may not be able to halt the operations of online services that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies  including social networks  or copycat online services that have misappropriated our data in the past or may misappropriate our data in the future 
these activities could harm our brand and our business 
from time to time  third parties have used data from our networks through scraping  robots or other means and aggregated this data on their online services with other data 
in addition  copycat online services have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our services 
these activities could degrade our brand  negatively impact our website performance and harm our business 
when we have become aware of such online services  in many instances we have employed contractual  technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt unauthorized activities 
in addition  if our customers do not comply with our terms of service  they also may be able to abuse our products and services and provide access to our solutions to unauthorized users 
however  we may not be able to detect any or all of these types of activities in a timely manner and  even if we could  technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations 
in some cases  particularly in the case of online services operating from outside of the united states  our available legal remedies may not be adequate to protect our business against such activities 
regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against these online services  any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources 
failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results 
we regard the protection of our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  trade dress  databases  domain names and patents as critical to our success 
we strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights and other rights provided under foreign laws  as well as through contractual restrictions 
we have a practice of entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors  and often enter into confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to  and disclosure and use of  our proprietary information 
however  these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information  infringement of our intellectual property rights or deter independent development of similar or competing technologies by others 
obtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property rights is expensive  including the costs of defending our rights 
we are seeking to protect our trademarks  patents  and domain names in a number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and may not be successful in all jurisdictions for every such right or which we may not pursue in every location 
in particular  we believe it important maintain  protect and enhance the linkedin brand 
accordingly  we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks  and service marks in the united states and in certain locations outside the united states 
we have already and may  over time  increase our investment in protecting innovations through investments in patents and similar rights that is expensive and time consuming 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our proprietary rights or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 
any litigation of this nature  regardless of outcome or merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our linkedin brand and other valuable trademarks and service marks 

table of contents in addition  we have chosen to make certain of our technology available under open source licenses that allow others to use the technology without payment to us 
while we hope to benefit from these activities by receiving useful open source technology in return under open source licenses  there is no assurance that we will receive the business benefits we expect 
if we fail to maintain  protect and enhance our intellectual property rights  our business and operating results may be harmed  and the market price of our class a common stock could decline 
we are  and may in the future be  subject to legal proceedings and litigation  including intellectual property and privacy disputes  which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results 
we are party to lawsuits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
these matters are often expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
we are currently facing  or may face in the future  allegations  lawsuits and regulatory inquiries  audits and investigations regarding data privacy  security and intellectual property infringement  including claims related to privacy  patents  publicity  trademarks  copyrights and other rights 
litigation and regulatory proceedings  and particularly the patent infringement and class action matters we are facing or may face  may be protracted and expensive  and the results are difficult to predict 
over the last year  we have experienced an increase in patent litigation involving non practicing entities  which are expensive to defend 
additionally  as certain litigation matters mature  costs related to those matters increase 
adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments  penalties and fines  or require us to modify our products and features while we develop non infringing substitutes or require us to stop offering certain features 
additionally  we could become subject to mandatory periodic audits as a result of regulatory proceedings  which would likely increase our regulatory compliance costs  and may require us to change our business practices  which could negatively impact our revenue growth 
managing legal proceedings and litigation  even if we achieve favorable outcomes  is time consuming and diverts management attention from our business 
in addition  we use open source software in our solutions and plan to use open source software in the future 
from time to time  we may face claims from others claiming ownership of open source software  or breach of open source license terms  including a demand for release of material portions of our source code or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license 
these claims could also result in litigation  require us to purchase a costly license  require us to establish specific open source compliance procedures  or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions  any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and determining reserves for pending litigation requires significant judgment  we do not believe that the final outcome of any individual matter that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  there can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct  and even if these matters are not resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements  these matters  and the time and resources necessary to litigate or  resolve them  could harm our business  our operating results  our reputation or the market price of our class a common stock 
if we do not continue to attract new customers  or if existing customers do not renew their subscriptions  renew on less favorable terms  or fail to purchase additional solutions  we may not achieve our revenue projections  and our operating results would be harmed 
in order to grow our business  we must continually attract new customers  sell additional solutions to existing customers and reduce the level of non renewals in our business 
our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and even when we do  they can generally terminate their relationship with us 
we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals  upgrades and expansions  so we may not accurately predict future trends for any of these metrics 
furthermore  unlike traditional software companies  the nature of our products and solutions is such that customers may decide to terminate or not renew their agreements with us without causing significant disruptions to their own businesses 
we must demonstrate that our talent solutions are an important recruiting tool for enterprises and professional organizations and that our marketing solutions provide them with access to an audience of one of the most influential  affluent and highly educated audiences on the internet 
however  potential customers may not be familiar with our solutions or may prefer other more traditional products and services for their talent  advertising and marketing needs 
the rate at which we expand our customer base or increase our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors  including the prices of our solutions  the prices of products and services offered by our competitors  reduced hiring by our customers or reductions in their talent or marketing spending levels due to macroeconomic or other factors and the efficacy and cost effectiveness of our solutions 
if we do not attract new customers or if our customers do not renew their 
table of contents agreements for our solutions  renew on less favorable terms  or do not purchase additional functionality or offerings  our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline 
ultimately  attracting new customers and retaining existing customers requires that we continue to provide high quality solutions that our customers value 
in particular  our talent solutions customers will discontinue their purchases of our solutions if we fail to effectively connect them with the talent they seek  and our premium subscribers will discontinue their subscriptions if they do not find the networking and business opportunities that they value 
similarly  customers of our marketing solutions will not continue to do business with us if their advertisements do not reach their intended audiences 
therefore we must continue to demonstrate to our customers that using our marketing solutions is the most effective and cost efficient way to maximize their results 
even if our marketing solutions are providing value to our customers  advertisers are sensitive to general economic downturns and reductions in consumer spending  among other events and trends  which generally results in reduced advertising expenditures and could adversely affect sales of our marketing solutions 
if we fail to provide high quality solutions and convince customers of our value proposition  we may not be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers  which would harm our business and operating results 
because we recognize most of the revenue from our talent solutions and our premium subscriptions over the term of the agreement  a significant downturn in these businesses may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 
we recognize revenue from sales of our talent solutions and premium subscriptions over the terms of the agreements  which is typically months 
as a result  a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from agreements entered into during previous quarters 
consequently  a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not significantly impact our revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue 
accordingly  the effect of significant declines in the sales of these offerings may not be reflected in our short term results of operations 
we depend on world class talent to grow and operate our business  and if we are unable to hire  retain and motivate our personnel  we may not be able to grow effectively 
our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain world class talent 
our ability to execute efficiently is dependent upon contributions from all of our employees  in particular our senior management team 
key institutional knowledge remains with a small group of long term employees and directors whom we may not be able to retain 
we may not be able to retain the services of any of our long term employees or other members of senior management in the future 
we do not have employment agreements other than offer letters with any key employee  and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee 
in addition  from time to time  there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business 
if our senior management team  including any new hires that we may make  fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis  our business could be harmed 
our growth strategy also depends on our ability to expand and retain our organization with world class talent 
identifying  recruiting  training and integrating qualified individuals will require significant time  expense and attention 
in addition to hiring new employees  we must continue to focus on retaining our best talent 
competition for these resources is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
we may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity for new employees and we may never realize returns on these investments 
if we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent  our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted  and our business will be harmed 
we believe that our culture has the potential to be a key contributor to our success 
from to  we increased the size of our workforce by more than  and we expect to continue to hire aggressively as we expand 
if we do not continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve  including maintaining our culture of transparency with our employees  it could harm our ability to foster the innovation  creativity and teamwork we believe we need to support our growth 
in addition  we completed our initial public offering in may as a result  employees who have been with us for longer than two years have been able to and may continue to realize substantial financial gains in connection with the sales of their shares from the exercise of their vested options  which could result in a loss of employees 
there will likely be disparities of wealth between those of our employees whom we hired prior to our initial public offering in may and those who joined us after we became a public company  which could adversely impact relations among employees and our culture in general 
the effectiveness of our marketing solutions depends in part on our relationships with advertising serving technology companies 
we rely  in part  on advertising serving technology companies to deliver our marketing solutions product 
our agreements with these companies may not be extended or renewed after their respective expirations  or we may not be able to 
table of contents extend or renew our agreements on terms and conditions favorable to us 
if these agreements are terminated  we may not be able to enter into agreements with alternative companies on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both  which could negatively impact revenue from our marketing solutions 
enterprises or professional organizations  including governmental agencies  may restrict access to our services  which could lead to the loss or slowing of growth in our member base or the level of member engagement 
our solutions depend on the ability of our members to access the internet and our services 
enterprises or professional organizations  including governmental agencies  could block or restrict access to our online services  website or the internet generally for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons  or they may adopt policies that prohibit listing the employers names on the employees linkedin profiles in order to minimize the risk that employees will be contacted and hired by other employers 
in some cases  certain governments may seek to restrict the internet or our service providers websites  services and solutions and the performance of our websites  services and solutions could be suspended  blocked in whole or part or otherwise adversely impacted in these jurisdictions 
for example  the government of the people republic of china has blocked access to many social networking and other sites  including ours  and certain self regulatory organizations have policies that could result in access to our content  services or features being blocked 
any restrictions on the use of our services by our members and users could lead to the loss or slowing of growth in our member base or the level of member engagement 
if internet search engines methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons  our member engagement could decline 
we depend in part on various internet search engines  such as google  bing and yahoo  to direct a significant amount of traffic to our website 
similarly  we depend on providers of mobile application store fronts to allow users to locate and download our mobile applications that enable our service 
our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our website and users of our online services is not entirely within our control 
our competitors search engine optimization  or seo  efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours  or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in an attempt to improve their search results  which could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking 
if search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our new user growth or in ways that make it harder for our members to use our website  or if our competitors seo efforts are more successful than ours  overall growth in our member base could slow  member engagement could decrease  and we could lose existing members 
these modifications may be prompted by search engine companies entering the online professional networking market or aligning with competitors 
our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past  and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future 
any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites would harm our business and operating results 
our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our members on personal computers and mobile devices 
if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change or internet access providers are able to block  degrade  or charge for access to certain of our products and services  we could incur additional expenses and the loss of members and customers 
our products and services depend on the ability of our members and customers to access the internet through their personal computers and mobile devices 
currently  this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace  including incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  mobile communications companies  and government owned service providers  any of whom could take actions that degrade  disrupt  or increase the cost of user access to our products or solutions  which would  in turn  negatively impact our business 
further  the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth  popularity or use of the internet  including laws limiting internet neutrality  could decrease the demand for our subscription service or the usage of our services and increase our cost of doing business 
our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with various third parties  including technology and content providers to grow our business 
identifying  negotiating and maintaining relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources  as does integrating third party content and technology 
our agreements with technology and content providers and similar third parties are typically non exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services 
our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to these parties to favor their solutions or may prevent us from developing strategic relationships with these parties 
in addition  these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them  and we have had  and may in the future have  disagreements or 
table of contents disputes with these parties  which could negatively affect our brand and reputation 
it is possible that these third parties may not be able to devote the resources we expect to the relationship or they may terminate their relationships with us 
further  as users increasingly access our services through mobile devices  we are becoming more dependent on the distribution of our mobile applications through third parties  and we may not be able to access their application program interfaces 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties  our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our business could be impaired  and our operating results would suffer 
even if we are successful  these relationships may not result in improved operating results 
if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future  the results of our operations  which are reported in us dollars  could be adversely affected 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non us locations in the local currency  and accept payment from customers in currencies other than the us dollar 
since we conduct business in currencies other than us dollars but report our financial results in us dollars  we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
consequently  exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability 
although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure  significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income 
additionally  hedging programs rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the intended tax efficiency of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business  and changes to our effective tax rate could adversely impact our results 
our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements  including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions  are intended to reduce our worldwide effective tax rate 
the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions  including the united states and the other jurisdictions in which we operate  to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements 
the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements  including our transfer pricing 
in particular  our international headquarters outside of the united states is located in dublin  ireland  but tax authorities in other jurisdictions where we operate  and specifically other countries in europe  may make a determination that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences  which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several other factors  many of which are outside of our control  such as increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  the tax effects of restructuring charges or purchase accounting for acquisitions  changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets  including those related to other than temporary impairment  and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
further  we are subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities 
any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the us taxation of international business activities  the adoption of other tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies in jurisdictions outside the united states could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
members of the us house of representatives and the us senate have released draft proposals to reform the us system for taxing cross border income 
provisions that would tighten tax laws with respect to international operations have been part of every obama administration budget and the president economic recovery advisory board perab has issued a report that includes an extensive discussion of international tax reform options perab 
possible future changes to us tax laws  including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the united states are repatriated to the united states  as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future  could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings 
additionally  changes in tax laws or regulations in jurisdictions outside the united states  including countries in europe  could materially impact our business 
due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities  any changes in the us or international taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we may require additional capital to support business growth  and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges  including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing solutions  improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
accordingly  we may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our class a common stock 
any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired  and our business may be harmed 
acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties  dilution  and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we have acquired several private companies in the last few years 
while these acquisitions were primarily to acquire talent and technology  we may engage in larger acquisitions in the future and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
we also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions 
the process of integrating an acquired company  business  or technology has created  and will continue to create  unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
the areas where we face risks include loss of key employees of the acquired company and other challenges associated with integrating new employees into our culture  diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges  implementation or remediation of controls  procedures  and policies at the acquired company  integration of the acquired company accounting  human resource  and other administrative systems  and coordination of product  engineering  and sales and marketing function  assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us  require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability  failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology  and liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including patent and trademark infringement claims  violations of laws  commercial disputes  tax liabilities  and other known and unknown liabilities 
these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments  incur unanticipated liabilities  and adversely affect our business generally 
future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses  or write offs of goodwill  any of which could harm our financial condition 
also  the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize 
risks related to our class a common stock the dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering  including our founders and our executive officers  employees and directors and their affiliates  and limiting our other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters 
our class b common stock has votes per share  and our class a common stock has one vote per share 
stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock  including our founders  and our executive officers  employees and directors and their affiliates  together held approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of december  our co founder and chair  reid hoffman  controlled approximately of our outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock  representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of december  therefore  mr 
hoffman has significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets 
mr 
hoffman will continue to have significant influence over these matters for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in addition  the holders of class b common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
because of the to voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock  the holders of our class b common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of class b common stock represent as little as of the combined voting power of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock 
this concentrated control will limit the ability of our class a stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future  and  as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock  which will have the effect  over time  of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term 
if  for example  mr 
hoffman retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time  he could  in the future  control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock 
as a board member  mr 
hoffman owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders 
as a stockholder  even a controlling stockholder  mr 
hoffman is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests  which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may be subject to volatility in the future 
the trading price of our class a common stock has been volatile historically  and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for example  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us or in valuation metrics  such as our price to earnings ratio  could impact our stock price 
additionally  the stock markets have at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and might in the future affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations have  in some cases  been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
further  the trading prices of publicly traded shares of companies in our industry have been particularly volatile and may be very volatile in the future 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes  international currency fluctuations or political unrest  may negatively impact the market price of our class a common stock 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention from other business concerns  which could harm our business 
there may be a limited market for investors in our industry 
there are few publicly traded companies in the social and professional networking and related industries at this time  and  in fact  we were among the first social networking companies to go public 
investors may have limited funds to invest in the social and professional networking sector  and as publicly traded securities in these industries become more available  investors who have purchased or may in the future purchase securities in this sector may choose to sell linkedin securities that they have already purchased in favor of other companies  and or choose to invest in other companies  including our competitors 
as a result  demand for our class a common stock could decline  which would result in a corresponding decline in our stock price 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult  limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our class a common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue  without further action by the stockholders  up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent  specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors  the chair of our board of directors  or our chief executive officer  establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting  including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors  establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes  class i  class ii and class iii  with each class serving three year staggered terms  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  provide that our directors may be removed only for cause  
table of contents provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office  even though less than a quorum  require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  and reflect two classes of common stock  as discussed above 
these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
in addition  institutional shareholder representative groups  shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices  including our dual class structure and the other anti takeover provisions  such as those listed above 
we generally will consider recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups  but we will make decisions based on what our board and management believe to be in the best long term interests of our company and stockholders 
our dual class structure concentrates the voting power of our stock in a small group of stockholders who would have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote 
additionally  these groups could make recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our positions 
finally  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  or publish negative reports about our business  our share price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our class a common stock depends  to some extent  on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares  our share price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources  divert management attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 
we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act  the dodd frank act  the listing requirements of the nyse and other applicable securities rules and regulations 
compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  make some activities more difficult  time consuming or costly  and increase demand on our systems and resources 
we have and will continue to consume management resources and incur significant expenses for section compliance on an ongoing basis 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies  stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs  pay fines  settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed 
as a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations  we may find that it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers 

table of contents we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their class a common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments

however  we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with such new or expanded facilities 
item legal proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  certain pending patent and privacy matters  including class action lawsuits  as well as inquiries  investigations  audits and other regulatory proceedings 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we do not believe that the final disposition of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages  and include claims for injunctive relief 
over the last year  we have experienced an increase in patent litigation involving non practicing entities  which are expensive to defend 
additionally  as certain litigation matters mature  costs related to those matters increase 
other regulatory matters could result in fines and penalties being assessed against us  and we may become subject to mandatory periodic audits  which would likely increase our regulatory compliance costs  and may require us to change our business practices  which could negatively impact our revenue growth 
we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
periodically  we evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued  if any  and make adjustments as appropriate 
significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being  and the estimated amount of  a loss related to such matters  and our judgment may be incorrect 
the outcome of any proceeding is not determinable in advance 
until the final resolution of any such matters that we may be required to accrue for  we may be exposed to loss in excess of the amount accrued  and such amounts could be material
