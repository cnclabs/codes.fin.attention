table of contents business overview air products and chemicals  inc and its subsidiaries serve energy  electronics  chemicals  metals  and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products  services  and solutions that include atmospheric  process and specialty gases  performance materials  equipment  and technology 
geographically diverse  with operations in over countries  in we had sales of billion  assets of billion  and a worldwide workforce of approximately  employees 
we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases  tonnage gases  electronics and performance materials  and equipment and energy 
refer to note  business segment and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments 
in summary in  we achieved both sales and earnings growth 
our results did fall short of the expectations we set at the beginning of the year as a result of slower than expected global economic growth 
global manufacturing grew approximately for the year and limited the opportunities for growth  particularly in our europe and asia merchant gases and electronics businesses 
overall  sales increased by resulting from acquisitions and higher energy cost pass through 
our underlying sales were higher on strength in our tonnage gases businesses  higher performance materials volumes  and lng equipment activity partially offset by weakness in our electronics equipment area 
the impact from winding down our pui business decreased underlying sales by 
our operating income and diluted earnings per share both increased versus the prior year 
while the difficult global economic environment persisted  we took actions to offset this weakness and to improve results in the future 
we delivered significant cost savings from the european focused reorganization and committed to additional actions aimed at reducing costs through product exits and asset rationalizations  as well as organizational improvements 
the additional actions are focused on improving our electronics business  restructuring our global operations function  and further optimizing our cost structure in europe 
finally  we remain on track to exit our pui business in fiscal year as we continue to manage our business portfolio 
highlights for sales of  increased  or  as acquisitions and higher energy contractual cost pass through to customers were partially offset by lower volumes from our previously announced decision to exit the pui business 
operating income of  increased  or on a non gaap basis  operating income of  increased  or  with acquisitions and favorable volume mix partially offset by higher energy and distribution costs and higher operating costs  including pensions 
income from continuing operations of  increased  or  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of increased  or 
on a non gaap basis  income from continuing operations of  increased  or  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of increased  or 
a summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share  including a non gaap reconciliation  is presented below 
capital spending was  for the year ended september on a non gaap basis  capital spending of  decreased  primarily from the prior year acquisition of indura sa we purchased million of our outstanding shares at a cost of we increased our quarterly dividend by from

we expect that the us will grow as it continues to face unresolved fiscal challenges  weak job growth  low consumer confidence  and lower global demand 
we are hopeful that an economic recovery will begin in europe with growth of 
in asia  we expect a gradual acceleration in growth  particularly in china  of 
in south america  we expect growth of  which is largely dependent on global demand driving exports 
we anticipate higher earnings in from new plant onstreams  higher lng activity  and volume loading on existing assets  recognizing that the last factor will be most influenced by the economy 
pension expense should be lower as a result of higher interest rates 
these positive impacts will be partially offset by higher maintenance expense and more shares outstanding 
we also expect lower earnings from the shutdown of our pui business 
the cost reduction actions implemented in and should provide benefits in and beyond 
outlook by segment in merchant gases  volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy 
we have available capacity in each region and expect that an improving economy will increase loading on these assets and drive growth 
we expect each region of the business to benefit from the cost reduction actions 
tonnage gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams supported by long term take or pay contracts 
however  we also expect higher planned plant maintenance costs from scheduled customer outages and the unfavorable impact of our exit from the pui business 

table of contents we expect that electronics growth will begin to rebound in following a weak and overall  we expect silicon growth of in additionally  we expect the business to benefit from the cost reduction actions and product line restructuring 
for performance materials  we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of  with volume growth improving due to a better economy 
equipment and energy results are expected to improve due to continued higher activity in our lng equipment business

on april  we entered into a five year  revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks the credit agreement  under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program 
we entered into this agreement to increase the previously existing facility by  extend the maturity date to april  and modify the financial covenant 
the company s only financial covenant is a 
table of contents maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization of 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of september the credit agreement terminates and replaces the company s  revolving credit agreement dated july  as subsequently amended  which was to mature june and had a financial covenant of long term debt divided by the sum of long term debt plus equity of no greater than 
no borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination  and no early termination penalties were incurred 
effective june  we entered into an offshore chinese renminbi rmb syndicated credit facility of rmb  million  maturing in june there are rmb million in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at september additional commitments totaling are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries  of which was borrowed and outstanding at september an acquisition financing facility was arranged with banco santander  chile to provide the initial financing required for the indura sa business combination 
this was a chilean peso clp committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of clp billion 
of this facility  clp billion was drawn on july to fund the business combination and related expenses  and the balance of the commitment was cancelled 
this facility was fully repaid on august  primarily with proceeds from us commercial paper issuance 
a portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the senior fixed rate note issued on september that matures on october as of september  we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 
as of september  we classified of commercial paper as long term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our  committed credit facility maturing in our current intent is to refinance this debt via the us public or private placement markets 
on september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal year  million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of at september  in share repurchase authorization remains 
outlook cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we project a modest need to access the long term debt markets in  primarily to refinance commercial paper 
we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
also  we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short term debt markets 
dividends on march  the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share 
dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts  such as debt agreements  lease agreements  unconditional purchase obligations  and other long term obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of september payments due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital leases operating leases pension obligations unconditional purchase obligations discontinued operations total contractual obligations 
table of contents long term debt obligations the long term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long term debt  including current portion  and the related contractual interest obligations 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt  which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest 
we had  of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at september  excluding fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate debt 
the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at september variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us short term tax exempt interest rates 
leases refer to note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities 
refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements 
these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates  plan demographics  actual return on plan assets  continuation or modification of benefits  and other factors 
such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 
unconditional purchase obligations approximately of our long term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and syngas facilities 
the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas 
however  long term take or pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply 
due to the matching of most long term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts  we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations 
the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations  which are primarily pass through contracts with our customers 
in addition  purchase commitments to spend approximately for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in we also purchase materials  energy  capital equipment  supplies  and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations 
the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy  which are obtained under requirements type contracts at market prices 
in total  we purchase approximately billion annually  including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
income tax liabilities noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of september were tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of september were these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table  as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates  and our operating results 
in addition  there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities 
refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
discontinued operations payables and accrued liabilities as of september include for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our homecare business 
refer to note  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents put options we currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our air products san fu company  ltd 
and indura sa subsidiaries 
the put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing  we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table 
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees 
the principal defined benefit pension plans the us salaried pension plan and the us pension plan were closed to new participants in and were replaced with defined contribution plans 
over the long run  the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 
for  the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to  from  in the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was  and  in and  respectively 
refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 
pension expense pension expense special terminations  settlements  and curtailments included above weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average expected rate of compensation increase vs 
the increase in pension expense  excluding special items  was primarily attributable to the bp decrease in weighted average discount rate  resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses 
the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in special items of primarily included for pension settlement losses and for special termination benefits relating to the business restructuring and cost reduction plan 
vs 
pension expense in  excluding special items  was comparable to expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year 
outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately to  excluding special items  in  a decrease of to from  resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates  partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions 
pension settlement losses of to are expected  dependent on the timing of retirements 
in  pension expense will include approximately for amortization of actuarial losses compared to in net actuarial gains of were recognized in  resulting primarily from an approximately bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns 
actuarial gains losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses 
future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets  different from expected returns  would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans  which are primarily non qualified plans 
with respect to funded plans  our funding policy is that contributions  combined with appreciation and earnings  will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 
in addition  we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions 
with the assistance of third party actuaries  we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan  which help guide the level of contributions 
during and  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were and  respectively 
contributions for include voluntary contributions for us plans of us 
table of contents for  cash contributions to defined benefit plans  including benefit payments for unfunded plans  are estimated to be to contributions to unfunded plans are dependent upon the timing of retirements 
actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation  discount rates  investment performance  plan design  and various other factors 
refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page for a projection of future contributions 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla the federal superfund law  resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation 
our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled   and in   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards 
future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
although precise amounts are difficult to determine  we estimate that we spent in both and on capital projects to control pollution 
capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately in both and we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from to a reasonably possible upper exposure of the consolidated balance sheets at september and included an accrual of and  respectively 
the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace  florida  piedmont  south carolina  paulsboro  new jersey  and pasadena  texas  locations is included in these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 
some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme and california s cap and trade scheme  mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta  canada  and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario  canada  and south korea 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities 
at the us state level  california s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted  and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began january we have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 
increased public awareness and concern may result in more international  us federal  and or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power  hydrogen production  and fluorinated gases production 
we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms  but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long term impact on us 
any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us 
we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption  improve efficiency  and lower emissions 
we are also 
table of contents developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere  enable cleaner transportation fuels  and facilitate alternate fuel source development 
in addition  the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen  one of our main products  and our proprietary technology for delivering low cost oxygen 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
related party transactions our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business 
we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm s length with clearly independent parties 
inflation we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates 
the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost 
accordingly  depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
however  application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at september totaled  and depreciation expense totaled during plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
assumptions on the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  market demand  competitive position  raw material availability  and geographic location 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technology  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
we have numerous long term customer supply contracts  particularly in the gases on site business within the tonnage gases segment 
these contracts principally have initial contract terms of to years 
there are also long term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment 
these contracts principally have initial terms of to years 
additionally  we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily to years 
the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to years for certain redeployable assets 
depreciable lives of the production assets related to long term contracts are matched to the contract lives 
extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term 
as contract terms are extended  the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term  as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 

table of contents the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally years 
customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment  where there is not an associated long term supply agreement  range from to years 
these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances  potential obsolescence  competitors actions  etc 
management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 
a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below decrease life by year increase life by year merchant gases electronics and performance materials impairment of assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset grouping  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition  a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping  or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset group is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value 
an estimate of the asset group s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce  inflation  etc 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity 
goodwill  including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of  was  as of september the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 
goodwill increased in  primarily as a result of the epco and wcg acquisitions in merchant gases during the third quarter 
disclosures related to goodwill are included in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists 
the tests are done at the reporting unit level  which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly 
currently  we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units 
reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 
as part of the goodwill impairment testing  and as permitted under the accounting guidance  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit  or if the 
table of contents initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  additional quantitative testing is required 
the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we primarily use an income approach valuation model  representing the present value of future cash flows 
our valuation model uses a five year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple 
management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business  long term contractual nature of the business  relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units  and limited comparables within the industry 
the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  and exit multiple 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions 
also  the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption  which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
if the first step of the quantitative test indicates potential impairment  the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill would be compared to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill was greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
during  there were no events or changes in circumstances identified that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment utilizing the quantitative approach 
we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value  and therefore there were no indications of impairment 
intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives at september totaled and consisted primarily of customer relationships  purchased patents and technology  and land use rights 
these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long lived asset grouping impairment tests 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 
indefinite lived intangible assets at september totaled and consisted of trade names and trademarks 
indefinite lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying value prior to performing the additional quantitative testing 
to determine fair value  we utilize an income approach  the royalty savings method 
this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and determined that the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value 
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled  at september the majority of our investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business 
summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements 
equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment loss would be recognized 
management s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee 
changes in key 
table of contents assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate 
at september  accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to and  respectively 
tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of september were  excluding interest and penalties 
income tax expense for the year ended september was disclosures related to income taxes are included in note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 
a point increase decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease increase net income by approximately pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 
actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans 
these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis  therefore  the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increase 
note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans 
the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover rates 
we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality  and turnover 
one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate 
this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans 
the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
this rate will change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the discount rate decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long term returns of major asset classes and the historical 
table of contents performance of plan assets 
in determining asset class returns  we take into account historical long term returns and the value of active management  as well as the interest rate environment 
asset allocation is determined based on long term return  volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes  the profiles of the plans liabilities  and acceptable levels of risk 
lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
we use a market related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans 
investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five year period from the year in which they occur  which reduces year to year volatility 
the market related value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value 
expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets 
the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption 
we determine this rate based on review of the underlying long term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience  as well as comparison to peer companies 
a bp increase decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases decreases pension expense by approximately per year 
loss contingencies in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies  ie  situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us 
we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters  for which our accounting policy is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and particulars are provided in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated 
these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies 
revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted 
for example  due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures  a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated  the scope of remediation is increased  or our proportionate share is increased 
similarly  a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 
we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies  see note  major accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
additionally  we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass through contracts with customers and price increases 
our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt including current portion  interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange forward contracts 
the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 
at september and  the net financial instrument position was a liability of  and  respectively 
the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long term debt excluding exchange rate impacts 
the increase in book value was primarily driven by the issuance of a eurobond for million on august that matures on august and the classification of of commercial paper as long term debt due to our ability and intent to refinance the debt under our  committed credit facility maturing in the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates  spot and forward exchange rates  and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 
interest rate risk our debt portfolio  including swap agreements  as of september primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars and euros  including the effect of currency swaps 
this debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous bp move in interest rates from the level at september  with all other variables held constant 
a bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
a bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 

table of contents based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio  including the interest rate swap agreements  a bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional and of interest incurred per year at the end of september and  respectively 
a bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by and per year at september and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at september and  with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase  respectively  of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the euro versus the pound sterling 
foreign currency debt  cross currency interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
