item business overview on january   we began operating as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes  specializing in group oriented  destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on that portion of our capital gain or ordinary income from our reit operations that is distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially will eliminate the federal double taxation on earnings from our reit operations  or taxation once at the 
table of contents corporate level and again at the stockholder level  that generally results from investment in a regular c corporation 
our non reit operations  which consist of the activities of our taxable reit subsidiaries trss that lease or sublease our hotels from our qualified reit subsidiaries  as well as businesses within our opry and attractions segment  will continue to be subject  as applicable  to federal and state corporate income taxes 
our owned assets include a network of four upscale  meetings focused resorts totaling  rooms that are managed by world class lodging operator marriott international  inc marriott under the gaylord hotels brand 
these four resorts  which we refer to as our gaylord hotels properties  consist of the gaylord opryland resort convention center in nashville  tennessee gaylord opryland  the gaylord palms resort convention center near orlando  florida gaylord palms  the gaylord texan resort convention center near dallas  texas gaylord texan and the gaylord national resort convention center near washington dc gaylord national 
other owned assets managed by marriott include gaylord springs golf links gaylord springs  the wildhorse saloon  the general jackson showboat general jackson and the inn at opryland  a room overflow hotel adjacent to gaylord opryland 
we also own and operate a number of media and entertainment assets including the grand ole opry  the legendary weekly showcase of country music s finest performers for nearly years  the ryman auditorium  the storied former home of the grand ole opry located in downtown nashville  and wsm am  the opry s radio home 
our operations are organized into three principal business segments i hospitality  which includes our hotel properties and the results of hotel operations  ii opry and attractions  which includes our grand ole opry assets  wsm am and our nashville attractions  and iii corporate and other  which includes corporate expenses 
these three business segments hospitality  opry and attractions  and corporate and other represented approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues for financial information by industry segment and for each of our gaylord hotels properties as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended appears in item  selected financial data  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in the financial reporting by business segments note note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our strategic plan our goal is to become the nation s premier hospitality reit for group oriented meetings hotel assets located in urban and resort markets 
existing hotel property design 
our hotel properties focus on the large group meetings market in the united states and incorporate meeting and exhibition space  signature guest rooms  food and beverage offerings  fitness and spa facilities and other attractions within a large hotel property so attendees needs are met in one location 
this strategy creates a better experience for both meeting planners and guests  and has led to our current hotel properties claiming a place among the leading convention hotels in the country 
expansion of hotel asset portfolio 
while we intend our short term capital allocation strategy to focus on paying cash dividends to stockholders and our announced plan to engage in stock repurchases  part of our long term growth strategy includes acquisitions of other hotels  particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry  either alone or through joint venture or alliances with one or more third parties 
we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters  specifically  group oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal 
we are interested in highly accessible upper upscale assets with over hotel rooms in urban and resort group destination markets 
we also consider assets that possess or are located near convention centers that present a repositioning opportunity and or would significantly benefit from capital investment in additional rooms or meeting space 
we plan to expand the geographic diversity of our existing asset portfolio through acquisitions 
as a reit  we no longer view independent  large scale development of resort and convention hotels as part of our long term growth strategy 
leverage brand name awareness 
we believe the grand ole opry is one of the most recognized entertainment brands in the united states 
we promote the grand ole opry name through various media  including our wsm am radio station  the internet and television  and through performances by the grand ole opry s members  many of whom are renowned country music artists 
as such  we have alliances in place with multiple distribution partners in an effort to foster brand extension 
we are continuously exploring additional products  such as television specials and retail products  through which we can capitalize on our brand affinity and awareness 
we believe that licensing our brand for products may provide an opportunity to increase revenues and cash flow with relatively little capital investment 

table of contents the convention hotel segment of the lodging industry our gaylord hotels properties compete in the convention hotel segment of the lodging industry in the united states and are designed to appeal to meeting planners who arrange large group meetings 
according to the february study  the economic significance of meetings to the us economy  conducted by pricewaterhousecoopers and published by the convention industry council  in  convention hotels that attract larger group meetings typically have more than  guest rooms and  on average  contain approximately  square feet of exhibit space and approximately meeting rooms 
the study reports that the group meetings market was comprised of approximately million events in  of which approximately were corporate meetings and approximately were conventions  trade shows  incentive and other meetings 
of the largest hotels with meeting space  as tracked by smith travel research  over half of the hotels contain over  square feet of meeting and exhibit space 
conversely  only of these properties feature  square feet or more to host the nation s largest groups 
examples of industries participating in larger meetings include health care  home furnishings  computers  sporting goods and recreation  education  building and construction  industrial  agriculture  food and beverage  boats and automotive 
conventions and association sponsored events  which draw a large number of attendees requiring extensive meeting space and room availability  account for over half of total group spending and economic impact 
because groups  associations and trade shows generally select their sites two to six years in advance and group customers enter into contracts that provide for minimum spending on stays and cancellation and attrition fees  we believe the convention hotel segment of the lodging industry is more predictable than the general lodging industry 
based on our information and information and data obtained from smith travel research  the top hotels within the united states with the greatest levels of self contained exhibit and meeting space as of january are as follows facility location hotel rooms total exhibit and meeting space sq

marriott assumed the day to day management of our gaylord hotels properties beginning october   and the inn at opryland beginning december  we expect  among other things  that our gaylord hotels properties will generate increased revenues as marriott will deliver new customer flows through their expansive sales force and popular frequent traveler program  as well as their ability to manage group business

beginning october   marriott assumed the management of the day to day operations of the wildhorse saloon 
wsm am 
wsm am commenced broadcasting in the involvement of ryman s predecessors with country music dates back to the creation of the radio program that became the grand ole opry  which has been broadcast live on wsm am since wsm am is broadcast from the gaylord opryland complex in nashville and has a country music format 
wsm am is one of the nation s clear channel stations  meaning that no other station in a mile radius uses the same frequency for night time broadcasts 
as a result  the station s signal  transmitted by a  watt transmitter  can be heard at night in much of the united states and parts of canada 
corporate and other segment our corporate and other segment includes operating and selling  general and administrative expenses related to the overall management of the company which are not allocated to the other reportable segments  including costs for our retirement plans  equity based compensation plans  information technology  human resources  accounting  and other administrative expenses  and formerly included our ownership interests in certain investments 
corporate history and structure we were originally incorporated in and were reorganized in connection with a corporate restructuring 
in  we completed restructuring transactions intended to facilitate our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  which included the merger  effective on october   of our predecessor  gaylord  with and into its wholly owned subsidiary  ryman  with ryman surviving the merger  at which time it succeeded to and began conducting  directly or indirectly  all of the business conducted by gaylord immediately prior to the merger 
prior to marriott s assumption of the day to day management of our hotels and certain of our nashville attractions  we managed such assets 
all of our assets are held by  and all of our operations are conducted through  rhp hotel properties  lp  a delaware limited partnership the operating partnership 
in the future  we may amend the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership to provide that its partnership units will be convertible on a one for one basis for shares of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  we may issue such partnership units as consideration to acquire hotel properties 
by offering partnership units  the seller of such hotel property could defer federal income tax on any of the seller s gains on sale  and this tax advantage may enable us to acquire hotel properties in the future which otherwise may not be available for sale 
as a reit  at least of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived from rents from real property or other income permitted by the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
to meet this requirement  our hotel properties are owned or leased by certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership  which are disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes  and these subsidiaries lease or sublease our hotels to our trss pursuant to leases that contain economic terms which are similar to leases between unrelated parties 
the rent that we receive from our trs lessees qualifies as rents from real property as long as the property is operated on behalf of our trs lessees by a person who qualifies as an independent contractor as defined in the code and who is  or is related to a person who is  actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities as defined in the code for any person unrelated to us and our trs lessees an eligible independent contractor 
our trs lessees have engaged marriott to manage the day to day operations of our hotels as an eligible independent contractor 

table of contents in addition  we own our opry and attractions businesses in trss  and certain of those trss have engaged marriott to manage their assets  as described above 
tax status as a reit  we generally are not subject to corporate federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders 
in addition to the requirement that of our gross income for each taxable year be derived from rents from real property discussed above  we are subject to other organizational and operational requirements including the requirement that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year and the requirement that no more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include various kinds of entities 
we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year  or to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income 
we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes until the fifth year following the year in which qualification is lost 
our non reit operations  which consist of the activities of our trss that lease or sublease our hotels from our qualified reit subsidiaries  as well as businesses within our opry and attractions segment  will continue to be subject  as applicable  to federal and state corporate income taxes 
employees as of february   we had approximately full time and part time and temporary employees 
of these  approximately full time and part time employees were employed in our opry and attractions segment  and approximately full time and part time employees were employed in our corporate and other segment 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
effective october   we transferred our former employees involved in the day to day operations of our gaylord hotels  as well as the general jackson  gaylord springs and wildhorse saloon businesses  to marriott  and effective december   we transferred our former employees involved in the day to day operations of the inn at opryland 
on those respective dates  marriott assumed responsibility for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of these properties 
competition hospitality our current hotel properties compete with numerous other hotels throughout the united states and abroad  particularly the approximately convention hotels that  on average  have over  rooms and a significant amount of meeting and exhibit space 
we believe that competition among convention hotels is based on  among other things i the hotel s reputation  ii the quality of the hotel s facility  iii the quality and scope of a hotel s meeting and convention facilities and services  iv the desirability of a hotel s location  v travel distance to a hotel for meeting attendees  vi a hotel facility s accessibility to a recognized airport  vii the amount of entertainment and recreational options available in and in the vicinity of the hotel  viii service levels at the hotel  and ix price 
our hotels also compete against large municipal convention centers  including orlando  chicago  atlanta  nashville and washington dc the hotel business is management and marketing intensive 
our current hotel properties compete with other hotels throughout the united states for high quality management and marketing personnel 
we believe that marriott s international brand  marketing scale and ability to manage group business will improve our hotels competitive position in hotel management and marketing 
however  there can be no assurance that marriott will be able to attract and retain employees with the requisite managerial and marketing skills 
additionally  as a reit  we compete for investment opportunities in the hospitality industry  particularly the group oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry  with entities that may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
these entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage 
our focus on acquiring hotels in the large group meetings sector of the hospitality industry and the competition in this sector may generally limit the number of hotel properties that we are able to acquire 
this competition may also increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell to us  making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms 

table of contents opry and attractions the grand ole opry and our other attractions businesses compete with all other forms of entertainment and recreational activities 
the success of the opry and attractions group is dependent upon certain factors beyond our control  including economic conditions  the amount of available leisure time  transportation cost  public taste and weather conditions 
our radio station competes with numerous other types of entertainment businesses  and success is often dependent on taste and fashion  which may fluctuate from time to time 
management agreements our subsidiaries are parties to management agreements with marriott under which marriott assumed the day to day management of our gaylord hotels properties beginning october   the inn at opryland beginning december   and the general jackson  the wildhorse saloon  and gaylord springs beginning october  gaylord hotels

if one or more of our gaylord hotels properties were not a pooled hotel ie  if we cease to own the hotel or we lease the hotel to a third party  the thresholds used to calculate the incentive fee in the pooling agreement will be adjusted  and the incentive fee for the non pooled hotel will be based on such hotel s performance 
the management agreements and pooling agreement also contain certain restrictions on our incurring indebtedness that encumbers our gaylord hotels properties on an individual or aggregate basis 
the management agreements may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur  including the failure of marriott to satisfy certain performance standards 
the management agreements prohibit us from selling the gaylord hotels properties to certain persons  including any person who does not  in marriott s reasonable judgment  have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the management agreements  or any person who owns a controlling interest in a hotel brand eg  hilton  hyatt totalling at least ten full service hotels that are not affiliated with a brand but that are marketed and operated as a collective group  if such brand or group of hotels compete with marriott

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following specific risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k as these are important factors  among others  that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results 
it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties 
some statements in the business section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements and are qualified by the cautionary language regarding such statements 
see forward looking statements above 
if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit  we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income 
pursuant to our restructuring  we took the steps necessary to elect to be treated as a reit for tax purposes  effective for the taxable year ending december  to qualify as a reit  we plan to hold our non qualifying reit assets in one or more trss 
these non qualifying reit assets consist principally of non real estate assets related to our hospitality segment and the assets related to our opry and attractions segment as historically structured and operated 
if  in any taxable year  we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit  and are not entitled to relief under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we would be subject to federal and state income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes 
this adverse impact could last for five or more years because  unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would be taxable as a c corporation  beginning in the year in which the failure occurs  and we would not be allowed to re elect to be taxed as a reit for the following four years 
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit  we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate certain assets to pay any additional tax liability 
accordingly  funds available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be reduced 
reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code to our operations  as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions 
although we plan to operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules  we cannot assure you that we will so qualify or remain so qualified 
as a reit  failure to make required distributions to our stockholders would subject us to federal and state corporate income tax 
prior to  we had not paid a cash distribution on our common stock since we intend to declare regular quarterly distributions commencing with the first quarter of  the amount of which will be determined  and will be subject to adjustment  by 
table of contents our board of directors 
our board of directors has approved a dividend policy pursuant to which we will pay a quarterly cash dividend in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least of adjusted funds from operations as defined by us or of reit taxable income on an annual basis  whichever is greater 
this dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors and certain provisions of our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the policy 
to qualify and be taxed as a reit  we are generally required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our stockholders 
if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates  we may be unable to maintain the proposed quarterly distributions that approximate our taxable income  and may fail to qualify for taxation as a reit 
in addition  our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal and state income tax purposes  or the effect of nondeductible expenditures 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our reit taxable income  we will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code 
covenants in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy 
our million credit facility imposes  and future financing agreements are likely to impose  operating and financial restrictions on our activities  including restrictions on the payment of dividends 
these restrictions may prevent us from making distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy 
we may be required to borrow funds  sell assets  or issue equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements or maintain the asset ownership tests 
to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit  we may need to borrow funds  sell assets or issue equity  even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings  sales or offerings 
any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short and long term debt  to sell assets  or to offer equity securities to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit 
furthermore  the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures  future growth and expansion initiatives 
this would increase our total leverage 
in addition  if we fail to comply with certain reit asset ownership tests at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct the failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification 
as a result  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive assets 
these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 
complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock 
thus  compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments  including the purchase of non qualifying assets  the expansion of non real estate activities  and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss  and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 
furthermore  acquisition opportunities may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing 
in addition  as a reit  we may face investor pressures to not pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 
we conduct a significant portion of our business activities  including those currently operated within our opry and attractions segment  through trss 
under the code  no more than of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other non qualifying assets 
this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our opry and attractions segment as historically structured and operated or in other non reit qualifying operations or assets 
to meet our annual distribution requirements  we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations  including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt  and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds  sell assets or issue equity to fund these distributions  even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings  sales or offerings 

table of contents our planned use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us  and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement 
however  there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment 
in particular  if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss and certain other non qualifying assets to exceed of the fair market value of our assets  we would fail to qualify as a reit 
if our leases of our hotel properties to trs lessees are not true leases for federal income tax purposes  we may fail to qualify as a reit 
in order for the lease payments by our trs lessees to our property owning subsidiaries to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests  the lease or sublease must be considered a true lease for federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as a service contract  joint venture  or some other type of arrangement 
we believe we have structured our leases and subleases of our hotel properties to our trs lessees so that the leases will be considered true leases for federal income tax purposes  but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with this characterization 
if marriott or any future third party hotel manager fails to qualify as an eligible independent contractor  or if our hotels are not qualified lodging facilities  we will fail to qualify as a reit 
rent paid by a lessee or sublessee that is a related party tenant of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to reits 
an exception is provided  however  for leases of qualified lodging facilities to a trs so long as the hotels are managed by an eligible independent contractor and certain other requirements are satisfied 
we lease or sublease our hotel properties to trs lessees  and such trs lessees have engaged marriott as a third party hotel manager 
we believe marriott and any other third party hotel manager that our trs lessees may engage in the future will qualify as eligible independent contractors for federal income tax purposes 
among other requirements  to qualify as an eligible independent contractor  the third party hotel manager must not own  directly or through its stockholders  more than of our outstanding shares  and no person or group of persons can own more than of our outstanding shares and the shares or ownership interest of the third party hotel manager  taking into account certain ownership attribution rules 
the ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these thresholds are complex  and monitoring actual and constructive ownership of our shares by the third party hotel manager and their owners may not be practical 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded 
in addition  for a third party hotel manager to qualify as an eligible independent contractor  such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities as defined below for one or more persons not related to the reit or its trss at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a trs lessee 
we believe that marriott operates qualified lodging facilities for certain persons who are not related to us or our trss  and marriott has agreed in the hotel management agreements that it  or its affiliates  are eligible independent contractors and will maintain such status 
however  no assurances can be provided that marriott or any other hotel managers that we may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement 
failure to comply with this requirement would require us to find other third party hotel managers for future contracts  and  if we hired a third party hotel manager without knowledge of the failure  it could jeopardize our status as a reit 
finally  each property with respect to which our trs lessees pay rent must be a qualified lodging facility 
a qualified lodging facility is a hotel  motel or other establishment more than one half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis  including customary amenities and facilities  provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility 
we believe that our current hotel properties are qualified lodging facilities 
although we intend to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of properties  reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for qualified lodging facilities  and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied 

table of contents our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 
a reit generally is required to distribute at least of its reit taxable income to its stockholders 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and plans for future acquisitions and divestitures 
our board of directors has approved a dividend policy pursuant to which we will pay a quarterly cash dividend based on an annualized amount of at least of adjusted funds from operations as defined by us or of reit taxable income on an annual basis  whichever is greater 
the dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors and certain provisions of our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends in accordance with the policy 
consequently  our distribution levels may fluctuate 
there are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special dividend paid on december  to qualify for taxation as a reit effective for the year ended december   we are required to distribute to our stockholders our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods ending prior to january  to satisfy this requirement  on november   our board of directors declared a special dividend in the amount of per share of common stock  or an aggregate of approximately million to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november   payable on december  in a combination of cash and stock  as elected by stockholders 
we believe that the total value of the special dividend was sufficient to fully distribute our accumulated earnings and profits and that a portion of the special dividend exceeded our accumulated earnings and profits 
however  the amount of our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits is a complex factual and legal determination 
we may have had less than complete information at the time we estimated our earnings and profits or may have interpreted the applicable law differently from the irs 
substantial uncertainties exist relating to the computation of our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits  including the possibility that the irs could  in auditing tax years through  successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased  which could increase our pre reit accumulated earnings and profits 
thus  we may fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our pre reit accumulated earnings and profits by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
moreover  although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre reit accumulated earnings and profits  we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact to us of doing so 
even if we qualify as a reit  certain of our business activities will be subject to corporate level income tax  which will continue to reduce our cash flows  and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state  and local taxes on our income and assets  including alternative minimum taxes  taxes on any undistributed income  and state or local income  franchise  property and transfer taxes 
in addition  we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax  which could be significant in amount  to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit 
our business related to the non real estate assets of our hospitality segment and the assets of our opry and attractions segment is conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate non qualifying reit income as historically structured and operated 
those trs assets and operations continue to be subject  as applicable  to federal and state corporate income taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 
any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 
in addition  net operating losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit  except for use against current or future taxable income in the trss 
we are also subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently on all or a portion of the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period generally  ten years after the reit conversion is completed  to the extent of the built in gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election in excess of our then tax basis 
that tax on subsequently sold assets will be based on the fair market value and built in gain of those assets as of january  gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax 
we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability 
we cannot  however  assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 
in addition  the irs and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit  in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties  if any 
moreover  any increase in taxable income for these pre reit periods will likely result in an increase in pre reit accumulated earnings and profits  which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination 

table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the costs of our hedging  and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 
the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge liabilities 
generally  income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to any non us operations do not constitute gross income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions  the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests 
as a result of these rules  we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a trs 
this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear 
we have little experience operating as a reit  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders 
our senior management team has little experience operating a reit 
we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to operate our company successfully as a reit 
failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy debt service obligations and make distributions to our stockholders 
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended 
federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process  the irs  the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities 
changes to the tax laws  regulations and administrative interpretations  which may have retroactive application  could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict with certainty whether  when  in what forms  or with what effective dates  the tax laws  regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that any such change will not significantly affect our ability to qualify for taxation as a reit or the federal income tax consequences to us of such qualification 
the ability of our board of directors to revoke our reit qualification  without stockholder approval  may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 
our charter provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate the reit election  without the approval of our stockholders  if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we cease to be a reit  we will not be allowed a tax deduction with respect to distributions to our stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes  which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders 
if our third party hotel managers do not manage our hotel properties or other businesses successfully  our financial condition  results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be negatively impacted 
due to federal income tax laws that restrict reits from operating and managing hotels  we do not operate or manage any of our hotel properties as a reit 
we lease or sublease our hotel properties to trss  and such trs lessees have engaged marriott as a third party hotel manager pursuant to hotel management agreements 
marriott assumed management of the day to day operations of our gaylord hotels properties effective october   and of the inn at opryland effective december  we will identify third party hotel managers to operate and manage any hotels that we acquire in the future 
our third party hotel managers will be responsible for the day to day management of our hotel properties  including  but not limited to  implementing significant operating decisions  setting rates for rooms and meeting space  controlling revenue and expenditures  collecting accounts receivable  and recruiting  employing and supervising employees at our hotel properties 
we will not have the authority to require our third party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties in a particular manner  although we will have consent and approval rights for certain matters under our hotel 
table of contents management agreements with marriott  subject to the limitations described therein 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders are largely dependent on the ability of our third party hotel managers to operate our hotel properties successfully 
any failure by our third party hotel managers to provide quality services and amenities or to maintain and protect a quality brand name and reputation could have a negative impact on their ability to operate and manage our hotel properties successfully and could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that our third party hotel managers will operate and manage our hotel properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under the hotel management agreements  that our third party hotel managers will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other criminal or fraudulent activity  or that they will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us 
even if we believe our hotel properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operational metrics  we will have limited ability to require our third party hotel managers to change their method of operation of our hotel properties 
we generally will attempt to resolve issues with third party hotel managers through discussions and negotiations 
however  if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations  we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third party dispute resolution or arbitration 
we would be able to seek redress only if a third party hotel manager violates the terms of the applicable hotel management agreement  and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the hotel management agreement 
additionally  in the event we need to replace any of our third party hotel managers  we may experience significant business disruptions at the affected hotel properties  and may be liable  under certain circumstances  for significant damages and or be required to make certain payments to our third party managers 
the operation and management of our current hotel properties  the operation of which generates substantially all our hospitality segment revenue  is concentrated in marriott 
our current hotel properties  the operation of which generates substantially all our hospitality segment revenue  are operated and managed by marriott 
as a result  our operational risk is concentrated in one third party hotel manager  which makes us more vulnerable economically to any weakness of marriott than if we entered into hotel management agreements with several third party hotel managers 
we cannot assure you that marriott will satisfy its obligations to us or successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties 
any adverse developments in marriott s business and affairs  financial strength or ability to operate and manage our current hotel properties successfully could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of distributions to our stockholders 
additionally  we rely on the resources of and financial information provided by marriott to report the financial results of our hotel properties 
a failure by marriott to accurately report the financial results of our hotel properties could materially affect our understanding of the hotel properties performance as well as our ability to accurately report on the hotel properties performance 
further  marriott now owns the gaylord hotels brand and trademarks  and a failure on their part to maintain quality standards could harm the brand and damage our business 
we may not realize revenue enhancements and cost synergies as a result of transitioning the management of our hotels to marriott to the degree or as soon as we anticipate 
revenue growth and cost synergies for our hotel operations are largely dependent on the efforts of marriott 
the results of marriott s efforts to leverage its rewards program  customer channels and brands  as well as its management of demand for rooms  meeting space and banquets  may not result in revenue growth to the extent or in the timeframe we anticipate 
in addition  marriott s efforts to reduce hotel level costs may not result in long term cost savings in the amounts that we anticipate 
further  we may not be able to identify additional opportunities to implement costs improvement strategies at the corporate level 
restrictive covenants and other provisions in our hotel management agreements with third party hotel managers could limit our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties or refinance our existing debt 
our hotel management agreements with marriott contain  and we anticipate that hotel management agreements with our future third party hotel managers will contain  restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility to sell or lease our hotel properties 
for example  we may not sell or lease our current hotel properties to a competitor of marriott as defined in our management agreements with marriott  and any purchaser or lessee must have  in marriott s judgment  sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the hotel management agreements 
such restrictions on our ability to sell or lease our hotel properties could negatively affect the marketability of our hotel properties and restrict our ability to refinance our existing debt secured by our hotel properties 

table of contents marriott and any future third party hotel manager may own or operate hotels that compete with our hotel properties 
our third party hotel managers may own or operate hotels that compete with our current hotel properties and any hotel properties that we acquire  which may result in a conflict of interest 
for example  marriott and its affiliates own  have invested in  operate  and have provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete or will compete with our current hotel properties  including the marriott orlando world center  which competes with gaylord palms  and the washington marriott marquis  a hotel currently under construction that will compete with gaylord national 
as a result  our third party hotel managers may make decisions regarding competing hotel properties that are not or would not be in our best interest 
in addition  such third party hotel managers operation of other hotels may divert attention away from the operation and management of our hotel properties 
our concentration in the hospitality industry  and in particular the group oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry  exposes us to certain risks outside of our and marriott s control 
our primary business is hotel related  and our current hotel properties  the operation of which generates substantially all our hospitality segment revenue  are concentrated in the group oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry 
therefore  a downturn in the lodging industry  in general  and the group oriented meetings sector  in particular  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
the ability of marriott to successfully operate and manage our current hotel properties and convention business is subject to factors beyond our and their control  which could reduce the revenue and operating income of these properties 
these factors include the desirability and perceived attractiveness of the nashville  tennessee  orlando  florida  dallas  texas  and washington dc areas as tourist and convention destinations  adverse changes in the national economy and in the levels of tourism and convention business that are affecting our current hotel properties  the level of governmental group business  which may decrease due to the uncertainty surrounding the us government budget  marriott s ability to attract group convention business  marriott s ability to contract for and collect attrition and cancellation fees from groups that do not fulfill minimum stay or spending requirements  the opening of other new hotels could impact the group convention business at our current hotel properties  the highly competitive nature of the hotel  tourism and convention business in which our hotel properties operate  including the fact that we compete for convention business with publicly financed civic convention centers  the susceptibility of group convention business to reduced levels of demand during the year end holiday periods  which marriott may not be able to offset by attracting sufficient general tourism guests  the financial condition of the airline and other transportation related industries and the resulting impact on travel  and organized labor activities  which could cause a diversion of business from our hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of group business 
these factors could reduce the revenues and net operating profits of our trs lessees  which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents due to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties  we are subject to a greater degree of risk to certain factors 
due to the geographic concentration of our current hotel properties  we are subject to a greater degree of risk to factors  including local economic and competitive conditions  natural and other disasters  a decline in air passenger travel due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel  a decline in the attractiveness of the areas in which our hotels are located as a convention and tourism destination  and a decrease in convention and meeting business at any of our properties 
any of these could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
there is no assurance that the recent reorganization within and downsizing of our executive management team will not adversely affect our operations 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our executive management team to manage our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
in connection with the reit conversion  we reorganized and reduced the number of members of our executive management team and other employees within the corporate and other segment to reflect the fact that we no longer operate or manage our hotel properties  which has resulted in our having a more streamlined corporate overhead and executive management structure 
there is no assurance that the reorganization and reductions will not adversely affect our operations following our conversion to a reit  including in connection with our opry and attractions segment  certain parts of which we will continue to operate and manage 
we may be unable to successfully identify and complete future acquisitions  and our previously announced developments will not be pursued in the form we previously anticipated 
acquisitions of other hotels  particularly in the group oriented meetings sector of the hospitality industry  either alone or through joint venture or alliances with one or more third parties  are part of our long term growth strategy 
we may be unable to successfully identify or complete future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms or  if we are able to find favorable acquisition targets  we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or secure beneficial joint ventures or alliances 
we will evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business  including those that could be material in size and scope 
in addition  we no longer view independent large scale development of resort and convention hotels as a means of our growth 
as a result  we will not proceed with our previously announced aurora  colorado and other potential development projects in the form we previously anticipated 
while we continue to view aurora as a viable market  we have concluded that if and when our participation in the project moves forward  it should proceed under the direction and leadership of an unrelated third party who will most likely use its own resources to complete the project 
the hotel business is capital intensive  and our inability to obtain financing or successfully complete acquisitions or capital improvements could limit our growth 
acquisitions of hotels will require significant capital expenditures  and hotels that we acquire may need renovations and capital improvements at the time of acquisition 
all of our hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive 
if any hotels that we acquire are subject to franchise agreements  the franchisors of these hotels may also require periodic capital improvements as a condition to our maintaining the franchise licenses 
we may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and net of capital gains each year to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  our ability to fund acquisitions or capital expenditures through any retained earnings will be limited 
consequently  we will rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and improvements 
our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing  which will depend on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms 

table of contents in addition  capital improvements may give rise to the following risks possible environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  the possibility that revenues will be reduced while rooms  restaurants or other facilities are out of service due to capital improvement projects  a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on attractive terms  and uncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun 
the costs of renovations and capital improvements could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
our trs lessee structure will subject us to the risk of increased hotel operating expenses and the inability of our trs lessees to make lease payments to us 
our leases with our trs lessees will require our trs lessees to make lease payments to us based in part on gross revenues from our hotel properties 
our operating risks will include decreases in revenues at our hotel properties and increases in operating expenses of our hotel properties 
decreases in revenues or increases in operating expenses could adversely affect our trs lessees ability to make lease payments due under the leases  including  but not limited to  increases in wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  property taxes  insurance costs  and other operating expenses 
increases in those operating expenses can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock  and our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  our trs lessees ability to make lease payments will be affected by factors beyond their control  such as changes in general economic conditions  the level of demand for hotels and the related services of our hotel properties  competition in the lodging and hospitality industry  the third party managers ability to maintain and increase gross revenue at our hotel properties and other factors relating to the operations of our hotel properties 
our substantial debt could reduce our cash flow and limit our business activities 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total debt  all of which is currently scheduled to mature in and on january   we redeemed all of our remaining senior notes at par at a cost of million 
we may incur additional debt in connection with our potential expansions of gaylord palms and or gaylord texan or any additional hotel acquisitions  development  renovations  or capital improvement 
our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt  thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to make distributions to our stockholders and to fund future capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the hospitality industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that are less leveraged  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity  and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for various projects  including possible expansions of our existing properties and acquisitions of additional properties 

table of contents in addition  the terms of our million credit facility allow  and instruments governing any new debt may allow  us to incur substantial amounts of additional debt subject to certain limitations 
any such additional debt could increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
although our earnings were sufficient to cover fixed charges in  our substantial leverage is evidenced by our earnings being insufficient to cover fixed charges by million and million in and  respectively 
at the time any principal amount of our indebtedness is due  we may not have cash available to pay this amount  and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms  or at all 
we will be required to refinance our debt before it matures and there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms 
our outstanding convertible senior notes mature on october  on or before the maturity date  we may or may not have cash available to pay amounts due  and we may be required to refinance the notes 
currently  the revolving loans  letters of credit and term loans under our million credit facility mature on august   and we will be required to refinance this facility prior to such date 
our ability to refinance our million credit facility and our outstanding convertible senior notes on acceptable terms will be dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our assets  borrowing restrictions which may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options  including agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms  selling one or more hotel properties at unattractive prices or on disadvantageous terms  or defaulting on mortgages and allowing our lenders to foreclose 
any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
to service our debt and pay other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash  which may not be available to us 
our ability to make payments on  or repay or refinance  our debt  including our obligations under our convertible senior notes and any future debt we may incur  and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash from operations 
our future performance  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants and financial ratios in our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements  including other agreements we may enter into in the future 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may not have future borrowings available to us under our credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our existing financial agreements  including our million credit facility impose  and future financing agreements are likely to impose  operating and financial restrictions on our activities  including our ability to make distributions to any stockholder 
our million credit facility currently requires us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios  including minimum consolidated tangible net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum implied debt service coverage ratio and maximum funded debt to asset value ratio  and our million credit facility limits or prohibits our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  create liens  redeem and or prepay certain debt  pay dividends on our stock to our stockholders or repurchase our stock or other equity interests  make certain investments  enter new lines of business  
table of contents engage in consolidations  mergers and acquisitions  and agree to restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us 
in addition  the indenture governing our convertible senior notes restricts mergers under specified circumstances  may require us to offer to purchase the convertible senior notes from the holders upon the occurrence of specified fundamental changes  and may require adjustments in the conversion ratio for the convertible senior notes as a result of dividends or specified make whole fundamental changes 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities 
we do not believe the reit conversion and the related transactions resulted in a fundamental change or a make whole fundamental change 
various risks  uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests and ratios 
failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross default provisions 
a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt  including  in the case of our existing credit facility  our gaylord hotels properties 
under these circumstances  we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations 
in addition  the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing and to make distributions to our stockholders in accordance with our announced intended dividend policy 
our indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of our assets 
subject to applicable laws and certain agreed upon exceptions  our million credit facility is secured by liens on the substantial majority of our assets  including mortgages on each of our gaylord hotels properties 
in the event of a default under our million credit facility  or if we experience insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the holders of our secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security  and only then would holders of our unsecured debt be entitled to payment from our remaining assets 
we are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a holding company and we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  including our trss 
as a result  our ability to meet our debt service obligations substantially depends upon our subsidiaries cash flows and payments of funds to us by our subsidiaries as dividends  loans  advances  leases or other payments 
the payment of dividends and or making of loans  advances  leases or other payments by our subsidiaries will be subject to the approval of those subsidiaries boards 
our subsidiaries ability to pay such dividends and or make such loans  advances  leases or other payments may also be restricted by  among other things  applicable laws and regulations  current and future debt agreements and management agreements into which our subsidiaries may enter 
we and our third party hotel managers will rely on information technology in our operations  and any material failure  inadequacy  interruption  or security failure of that technology could harm our business 
we and our third party hotel managers will rely on information technology systems  including networks and the internet  to process  transmit  and store electronic information  and to manage or support a variety of business processes  including financial transactions and records  personal identifying information  reservations  billing and operating data 
our businesses require collection of large volumes of internal and customer data  including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers 
the integrity and protection of customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
if that data is inaccurate or incomplete  we or the hotel managers could make faulty decisions 
customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information 
the regulatory environment surrounding information  security and privacy is also increasingly demanding 
our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations  or may require significant additional investments or time to do so 
despite implementation of various measures designed to protect our information systems and records  including those we maintain with our service providers  we or the hotel managers may be subject to security breaches  system failures  viruses  operator error or inadvertent releases of data 
a significant theft  loss  or fraudulent use of customer  employee  or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply with the various us and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data or with payment card industry data security standards  could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses  fines  or litigation 
a breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems  resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits 

table of contents our real estate investments are subject to numerous risks 
because we own hotels and attractions properties  we are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property 
real estate values are expected to be depressed until general economic conditions improve 
the investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties  as well as the expenses incurred 
in addition  a variety of other factors affect income from properties and real estate values  including governmental regulations  insurance  zoning  tax and eminent domain laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
for example  new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and or time consuming to develop real property or expand  modify or renovate properties 
when interest rates increase  the cost of acquiring  developing  expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases 
similarly  as financing becomes less available  it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property 
finally  governments can  under eminent domain laws  take real property 
sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth 
any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  equity real estate investments  such as the investments we hold and any additional properties that we may acquire  are relatively difficult to sell quickly 
if our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our income will be reduced 
our properties are subject to environmental regulations that could impose significant financial liability on us 
environmental laws  ordinances and regulations of various federal  state  local and foreign governments regulate certain of our properties and could make us liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in the properties we currently own or operate or those we previously owned or operated 
those laws could impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present  could jeopardize our ability to develop  use  sell or rent the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
if we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes  we could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility  even if we never owned or operated that facility 
other laws  ordinances and regulations could require us to manage  abate or remove lead or asbestos containing materials 
similarly  the operation and closure of storage tanks are often regulated by federal  state  local and foreign laws 
finally  certain laws  ordinances and regulations  particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands  coastal zones and threatened or endangered species  could limit our ability to develop  use  sell or rent our real property 
existing governmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations relating to climate change  air quality or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us  which could affect the operations of our hotels and or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
additionally  because we rely on third party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions  we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable environmental laws or regulations or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act could require us to incur substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act of  as amended the ada  all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada s requirements could require removal of access barriers  and non compliance could result in the us government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages 
although we believe that our hotel properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ada  we may be subject to audits or investigations of all of our hotels to determine our compliance  and one or more hotels may not be fully compliant with the ada 
noncompliance with the ada could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance 
the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our hotel properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
if we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotel properties  whether to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and amount of cash available for debt service or distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 
additionally  because we rely on third party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions  we have limited control over ensuring compliance at those locations with applicable ada requirements or approving certain remediation action taken by the manager to resolve such issues 

table of contents we have invested in  and in the future may invest in  joint ventures or certain minority equity interest over which we may not have significant control  to or for which we may owe significant obligations and for which there is no readily available market  and these investments may not be profitable 
we may invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities  by acquiring non controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
these types of investments may not be liquid and we may have little or no rights  or ability  to exercise the direction or control of the respective enterprises 
in connection with these investments  we may have obligations under certain guarantees related to such investments 
the ultimate value of any joint ventures or minority investments will be dependent upon the efforts of others over an extended period of time 
the nature of our interests and the absence of a readily available market for those interests restrict our ability to dispose of them 
our lack of control over the management of any business in which we are a joint owner or minority investor and the lack of a readily available market to sell our interest in these businesses may cause us to recognize a loss on our investment in these businesses or to incur costs or liabilities that we do not control  but for which we may be required to contribute capital or satisfy financial commitments 
these arrangements are subject to uncertainties and risks  including those related to conflicting joint venture partner interests and to our joint venture partners failing to meet their financial or other obligations 
as an owner of hotel properties and operator of leisure businesses  we are subject to risks relating to acts of god  terrorist activity and war 
our operating income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be reduced by acts of god  such as natural disasters or acts of terrorism  in locations where we own and or operate significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers 
gaylord opryland  which is located adjacent to the cumberland river and is protected by levees built to sustain a year flood  suffered flood damage on may  as the river rose to levels that over topped the levees 
in response to the flood  we have increased the per occurrence flood insurance limit for our gaylord opryland hotel to million 
we have also completed enhancements to the levees that protect the hotel to increase the height of the levees 
while we believe these steps are reasonable given the likelihood of flood damage at gaylord opryland  there can be no assurances that flooding will not occur at gaylord opryland in the future 
in addition  in january of  the army corps of engineers announced that the wolf creek dam on lake cumberland in kentucky was at risk for structural failure 
although the corps is taking action  including lowering the water level at lake cumberland and making structural repairs to the dam to reduce the chances of a dam breach  a significant portion of our gaylord opryland property in nashville is in the cumberland river flood plain and would be at risk if the dam should fail 
some types of losses  such as from flood  earthquake  terrorism and environmental hazards  may be either uninsurable  subject to sublimit  or too expensive to justify insuring against 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
similarly  wars including the potential for war  terrorist activity including threats of terrorist activity  political unrest and other forms of civil strife as well as geopolitical uncertainty  may cause our future results to differ materially from anticipated results 
we are subject to risks associated with our hotel managers employment of hotel personnel  particularly with hotels whose managers employ unionized labor  which could increase our hotels operating costs  reduce the flexibility of our third party hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotel properties and impair our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
our third party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotel properties 
although we do not employ or manage employees at our hotel properties  we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force  including at those of our hotels with unionized labor 
from time to time  hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes  lockouts  public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity 
we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events 
the resolution of labor disputes or re negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs  either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs 
furthermore  labor agreements may limit the ability of our third party hotel managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated between the third party hotel managers and labor unions 
we do not have the ability to control the outcome of these negotiations 

table of contents any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business 
the reputation and perception of our brands is critical to our success 
if our trademarks or intellectual property are copied or used without authorization  the value of our brands  their reputation  our competitive advantages and our goodwill could be harmed 
we regularly apply to register our trademarks in the united states 
however  we cannot assure you that those trademark registrations will be granted or that the steps we take to protect our trademarks or intellectual property in the united states will be adequate to prevent others  including third parties or former employees  from copying or using our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization 
our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries outside the united states  where local law may not adequately protect it 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
as we have in the past  we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights 
litigation of this type could be costly  force us to divert our resources  lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business 
any failure to maintain and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of our brands and harm our business 
in addition  third party infringement of the gaylord hotels marks now owned by marriott  or the failure to enforce rights to the marks  could be damaging to our business 
hospitality companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state law and other claims  and we may be subject to legal claims 
our operating income and profits may be reduced by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees  customers or other third parties 
in recent years  a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits  including class action lawsuits  alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and other alleged violations of law 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants 
similar lawsuits have been instituted against us from time to time  and we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type or other claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we rely on third party managers to operate our hotel properties and certain attractions  we have limited control over defending lawsuits of this type or other claims 
even as a reit  changes in federal  state  or local tax law  interpretations of existing tax law or agreements with tax authorities could affect our profitability and financial condition by increasing our tax costs 
we are subject to taxation at the federal  state and local levels in the united states 
our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
from time to time  the us federal  state and local governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application thereof  which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretations and could adversely impact profitability 
state and local tax authorities have increased their efforts to increase revenues through changes in tax law and audits 
such changes and proposals  if enacted  could increase our future effective income tax rates  as well as other taxes  including property taxes 
healthcare legislation could adversely affect our results of operations 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the health reform law  was enacted 
among other things  the health reform law contains provisions that affect employer sponsored health plans and impose excise and other taxes and fees with respect to certain plans 
pursuant to our management agreements  our third party managers may pass certain health care costs for employees working at our properties through to us 
as such  the provisions of the health reform law may significantly raise our and our third party managers employee health benefits costs and or alter the benefits we or our third party managers are required to provide to our respective employees 
we continue to review provisions of the health reform law and their impact on employer sponsored plans 
costs associated with compliance with the health reform law are currently difficult to estimate  but we anticipate increased expenses relating to our and our third party managers company sponsored plans 
if we or our third party hotel managers are not able to limit or offset future cost increases  those costs could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 

table of contents current economic conditions may reduce demand for hotel properties and adversely affect hotel profitability 
the performance of the lodging industry has historically been closely linked to the performance of the general economy and  specifically  growth in us gdp 
it is also sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels 
declines in corporate travel budgets and consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions  such as declines in us gdp  risks affecting or reducing travel patterns  lower consumer confidence or adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our hotel properties and therefore the net operating profits of our trs lessees to whom we lease our hotel properties 
the recent global economic downturn led to a significant decline in demand for products and services provided by the lodging industry  lower occupancy levels and significantly reduced room rates 
we anticipate that recovery of demand for products and services provided by the lodging industry will lag improvement in economic conditions 
we cannot predict how slow the global or domestic economic recovery will be or how slow the recovery in the lodging industry will be 
an ongoing period of economic weakness will diminish our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our operating results and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the lodging industry 
our hotel properties have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets  and a hotel reit is structured differently than many other types of reits 
a typical office property owner  for example  has long term leases with third party tenants  which provide a relatively stable long term stream of revenue 
our trs lessees  on the other hand  do not enter into a lease with a third party hotel manager 
instead  our trs lessees engage our third party managers pursuant to hotel management agreements and pay the third party hotel managers fees for managing our hotel properties 
the trs lessees receive all the operating profit or losses at our hotel properties  net of fees and reimbursements 
moreover  virtually all hotel guests stay at a hotel for only a few nights at a time  so the rate and occupancy at each of our hotel properties changes every day 
as a result  we may have highly volatile earnings 
in addition  our hotel properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry  many of which are beyond our or a manager s control  including the following competition from other hotel properties and publicly financed civic convention centers in our markets  over building of hotels in our markets  which could adversely affect occupancy and revenues at our hotel properties  dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism  increases in energy costs and other expenses affecting travel  which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  adverse effects of international  national  regional and local economic and market conditions  the impact of the use of internet travel intermediaries by consumers  unforeseen events beyond our control  such as terrorist attacks  travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as hn influenza swine flu  avian bird flu and sars  political instability  regional hostilities  imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities  travel related accidents and unusual weather patterns  including natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  
table of contents adverse effects of a downturn in the lodging industry  and risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate  as discussed in more detail below 
these factors could reduce the net operating profits of our trs lessees  which in turn could adversely affect the amount of frequency of distributions we make to our stockholders and our ability to service our debt 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties and harm our financial condition 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more of our hotel properties in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions may be limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in international  national  regional and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  which may result in uninsured losses  and acts of war or terrorism  including the consequences of the terrorist acts  such as those that occurred on september  we may decide in the future to sell one or more of our hotel properties 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property 
further  as a reit  we are subject to a excise tax on net income derived from prohibited transactions  including the sale of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course 
there can be no assurances that the irs will not contend that the sale of a hotel is subject to this excise tax 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a hotel property can be sold 
we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a hotel  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that hotel for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that hotel 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents our organizational documents and delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of our company or our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions impose restrictions on transfer and ownership of our common stock that are designed to assist us in maintaining our status as a reit  authorize us to issue blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors  without stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of common stock  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at meetings  provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our chairman or by a majority of the members of our board of directors  prohibit stockholder actions taken on written consent  and impose restrictions on ownership of common stock by certain persons including non united states persons due to our ownership of a radio station 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions under delaware law  which could also delay or prevent a change of control 
together  our charter  bylaws  and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock  and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover 
our charter permits our board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
as of the date hereof  we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
our board of directors also has the power  without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any new series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights  preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution  liquidation or winding up and other terms 
in the event that we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction favorable to our stockholders 
the ownership limitations in our charter may restrict or prevent stockholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 
to qualify and remain qualified as a reit  no more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include various kinds of entities during the last half of any taxable year 
to assist us in qualifying as a reit  our charter contains a share ownership limit 
generally  any of our shares owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the share ownership limit 
this share ownership limit provides that subject to certain exceptions no person may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than  in value or in number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the outstanding shares of our capital stock  or any class or series of our capital stock 
if anyone transfers shares in a manner that would violate the share ownership limit or prevent us from qualifying as a reit  those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the share ownership limit or we will consider the transfer to be null and void from the outset  and the intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares 

table of contents our charter also prohibits the ownership of shares by any person or entity if such would violate or otherwise be inconsistent with federal communications laws or regulations pertaining to the ownership of television or radio stations  cable television or other radio authorizations by i foreign persons or entities  ii persons or entities having interests in television or radio broadcast stations  newspapers or cable television systems  and iii entities seeking direct or indirect control of us without prior federal regulatory approval 
in the event of a transfer that would result in a violation or inconsistency with federal communications laws or regulations we may refuse to permit the transfer  suspend the rights of share ownership as necessary to prohibit the violation or inconsistency  or redeem the shares 
anyone who acquires shares in violation of the share ownership limit or the other restrictions on transfer in the our charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our shares falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale 
in addition  these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of us by a third party without the approval of our board of directors  even if our stockholders believe the change of control is in their interest 
the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in our stockholders interest 
our board of directors determines our major policies  including policies and guidelines relating to our acquisitions  leverage  financing  growth  qualification as a reit and distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders 
accordingly  our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we may not have sufficient funds to make cash distributions to stockholders at intended payment levels  and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future 
as a reit  we will generally be required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gains each year for us to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code  which requirement we currently intend to satisfy  and we must distribute of our reit taxable income  including capital gains  to eliminate federal corporate income tax liability 
to the extent we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than of our reit taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
subject to maintaining our reit qualification  we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders  but no assurances can be made as to the amount of distributions in the future 
we have also announced our intention to make distributions at specified minimum levels 
our board of directors may alter our dividend policy at any time and will have the sole discretion to determine the timing  form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders 
among the factors that could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders are our inability to invest our available cash  our inability to realize attractive risk adjusted returns on our investments  unanticipated expenses that reduce our cash flow or non cash earnings  defaults in our investment portfolio or decreases in the value of the underlying assets  and the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate  as actual results may vary from estimates 
as a result  no assurance can be given that the level of any distributions we make to our stockholders in the future will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time  any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  distributions that we make to our stockholders will generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income and will generally not be eligible for reduced rates applicable to qualified dividend income 
however  a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gains income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes 
a return of capital is not taxable  but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder s investment in our common stock 

table of contents the market price of our common stock may vary substantially 
the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates and other factors 
one of the factors that may influence the market price of our common stock is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates  or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders  may lead prospective purchasers of our shares to demand a higher annual yield and choose other investments  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
other factors that could affect the market price of our common stock include the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  changes in market valuations of companies in the hotel or real estate industries  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes  issuances of common stock or other securities in the future  dilution or potential or perceived dilution from our convertible notes  disputes with our hotel managers  the addition or departure of key personnel  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances  and unforeseen events beyond our control  such as terrorist attacks  travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics  such as hn influenza swine flu  avian bird flu and sars  political instability  regional hostilities  increases in fuel prices  imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities  travel related accidents and unusual weather patterns  including natural disasters  such as hurricanes  tsunamis or earthquakes 
conversion of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  and the market price of our common stock may be impacted by note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of the notes may remain or again become convertible in other future calendar quarters if the closing market price of our common stock exceeds of the then effective conversion price for at least trading days during the consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the beginning of such calendar quarter 
upon the conversion of our convertible senior notes  we may elect  at our option  to deliver shares of common stock  cash  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock in satisfaction of our conversion obligations 
we intend to settle the face value of any notes that are converted in cash 
any shares of common stock that we elect to issue upon conversion of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  and any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the conversion rate of our convertible senior notes will be adjusted in connection with any special or regular dividends we pay pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions of the indenture governing the convertible senior notes  which will result in additional shares of our common stock becoming issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes 

table of contents in addition  we entered into note hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes  intended to reduce potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes 
we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions 
the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants 
the number of shares covered by and the strike price of the options and warrants purchased and entered into in connection with the note hedge transactions may also be adjusted upon the payment of any special or regular dividends pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions 
in connection with establishing their initial hedge for the note hedge and warrant transactions  we believe that each of these financial institutions  or their affiliates  entered into their own various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock 
these financial institutions or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and or by purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions during the time the convertible senior notes are outstanding 
in addition  we will exercise options we hold under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted 
to unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options  we expect each of these financial institutions or its affiliates will likely sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during any settlement period for converted notes 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
based on the current market price for our common stock and the effective conversion price per share of the convertible notes  our note hedge and warrant transactions would be insufficient to prevent dilution to our stockholders if the notes are converted and we settle the face value of the notes in cash and the remainder of the value in shares of common stock 
if all of the notes were converted and we settled the face value of the notes in cash and the remainder of the value in shares of our common stock  we would be obligated to issue approximately million shares of common stock  net of the effect of our note hedge and warrant transactions  assuming a volume weighted average trading price of our common stock of per share for each day of the day settlement period for the notes preceding the settlement date and for each of the expiration dates for portions of the warrants

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on january   we began operating as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes  specializing in group oriented  destination hotel assets in urban and resort markets 
our owned assets include a network of four upscale  meetings focused resorts totaling  rooms that are managed by world class lodging operator marriott international  inc marriott under the gaylord hotels brand 
these four resorts  which we refer to as our gaylord hotels properties  consist of the gaylord opryland resort convention center in nashville  tennessee gaylord opryland  the gaylord palms resort convention center near orlando  florida gaylord palms  the gaylord texan resort convention center near dallas  texas gaylord texan and the gaylord national resort convention center near washington dc gaylord national 
our other owned assets managed by marriott include gaylord springs golf links gaylord springs  the wildhorse saloon  the general jackson showboat general jackson and the inn at opryland renamed from the radisson hotel at opryland  a room overflow hotel adjacent to gaylord opryland 
we also own and operate a number of media and entertainment assets including the grand ole opry  the legendary weekly showcase of country music s finest performers for nearly years  the ryman auditorium  the storied former home of the grand ole opry located in downtown nashville  and wsm am  the opry s radio home 
each of our award winning gaylord hotels properties incorporates not only high quality lodging  but also at least  square feet of meeting  convention and exhibition space  superb food and beverage options and retail and spa facilities within a single self contained property 
as a result  our gaylord hotels properties provide a convenient and entertaining environment for convention guests 
our gaylord hotels properties focus on the large group meetings market in the united states 
in  we completed restructuring transactions to facilitate our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our goal is to become the nation s premier hospitality reit for group oriented meetings hotel assets located in urban and resort markets 
our concentration in the hospitality industry  and in particular the large group meetings sector of the hospitality industry  exposes us to certain risks outside of our control 
recessionary conditions in the national economy have resulted in economic pressures on the hospitality industry generally  and on our properties 
however  beginning in  the trend began to reverse  and we have begun to see stabilization in our industry and specifically in our business 
in and  we have seen increases in group travel as compared to recessionary levels  as well as growth in outside the room revenue  indicating that not only are group customers traveling again  they are spending more on food and beverage and entertainment during their stay at our properties 
group customers typically book rooms and meeting space with significant lead times  sometimes several years in advance of guest arrival 
during an economic recovery  group pricing tends to lag transient pricing due to the significant lead times for group bookings 
group business booked in earlier periods at lower rates continues to roll off  and with improving group demand  is being replaced with bookings reflecting generally higher rates 
our attrition and cancellation levels have also decreased compared to recessionary levels 
as discussed below  on october   marriott assumed responsibility for managing the day to day operations of our gaylord hotels properties and other of our nashville attractions and began managing the inn at opryland on december  as a result  we now rely upon marriott to generate improvements in occupancy and revenue levels at our hotel properties 
however  there can be no assurance that marriott will be able to increase occupancy and revenue levels at our hotel properties 
see forward looking statements and risk factors under part i of this report for important information regarding forward looking statements made in this report and risks and uncertainties we face 
significant developments in reit conversion and marriott sale transaction after conducting a strategic review of our business  on may   our board of directors unanimously approved a plan to restructure our business operations to facilitate our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes the reit conversion 
we completed the reit conversion during and will elect to be taxed as a reit for the year ending december  as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on that portion of our capital gain or ordinary income from our reit operations that is distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially will eliminate the federal double taxation on earnings from our reit operations  or taxation once at the corporate level and again at the stockholder level  that generally results from investment in a regular c corporation 
our non reit operations  which consist of the activities of trss that will act as lessees of our hotels  as well as the businesses within our opry and attractions segment  will continue to be subject  as applicable  to federal corporate income taxes 
the steps we took during to effect the reit conversion are summarized below 

table of contents the merger 
under requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  reits are subject to ownership restrictions such that no more than of the value of the reit s outstanding common stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined by the code to include various kinds of entities during the second half of any calendar year 
to implement articles of incorporation that enabled us to satisfy the requirements under the code and otherwise to address concerns related to stock ownership  our predecessor  gaylord entertainment company  formerly a delaware corporation gaylord  formed and merged with and into ryman hospitality properties  inc formerly known as granite hotel properties  inc  a delaware corporation ryman  effective october  the merger 
the merger was approved by the stockholders of gaylord at a special meeting of stockholders held on september  as a result of the merger  the outstanding shares of gaylord s common stock converted into the right to receive the same number of shares of ryman s common stock  and ryman succeeded to and began conducting  directly or indirectly  all of the business conducted by gaylord immediately prior to the merger 
the rights of our stockholders are now governed by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation the charter and our amended and restated bylaws 
the charter generally prohibits any stockholder from owning more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any other class or series of our stock 
these ownership limitations are subject to waiver or modification by our board of directors 
the shares of our common stock are trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol rhp 
pursuant to rule g a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  shares of common stock of ryman  as successor to gaylord  are deemed to be registered under section b of the exchange act 
implementation of upreit and trs structure 
to facilitate our qualification as a reit  we underwent a reorganization of our operations and corporate structure 
we now operate as an umbrella partnership reit an upreit  which means that all of our assets are held by  and operations are conducted through  rhp hotel properties  lp  a subsidiary operating partnership the operating partnership that we formed in connection with the reit conversion 
in the future  we may amend the limited partnership agreement of the operating partnership to provide that its partnership units will be convertible on a one for one basis for shares of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  we may issue such partnership units as consideration to acquire hotel properties 
by offering partnership units  the seller of such hotel property could defer federal income tax on any of the seller s gains on sale  and this tax advantage may enable us to acquire hotel properties in the future which otherwise might not be available for sale 
as a reit  at least of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived from rents from real property or other income permitted by the code 
to meet this requirement  we implemented a structure under which our hotel properties are owned or leased by certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership  which are disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes  and these qualified reit subsidiaries lease or sublease our hotels to taxable reit subsidiaries each  a trs pursuant to leases that contain economic terms which are similar to a lease between unrelated parties 
the rent that we receive from our trs lessees qualifies as rents from real property as long as the property is operated on behalf of our trs lessees by a person who qualifies as an independent contractor as defined in the code and who is  or is related to a person who is  actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities as defined in the code for any person unrelated to us and our trs lessees an eligible independent contractor 
as described below  our trs lessees have engaged marriott to manage the day to day operations of our hotels as an eligible independent contractor 
in addition  we own our opry and attractions businesses in trss  and certain of those trss have engaged marriott to manage their assets  as described below 
marriott management 
on october   we completed the marriott sale transaction pursuant to that certain purchase agreement  dated may   by and among gaylord  gaylord hotels  inc  marriott hotel services  inc  and marriott  pursuant to which we sold the gaylord hotels brand and rights to manage our gaylord hotels properties for million in cash the marriott sale transaction 
in connection with the marriott sale transaction  each of our trs lessees for our gaylord hotels properties is now a party to a management agreement one for each of our gaylord hotels properties and a pooling agreement with marriott 
under the management agreements  on october   marriott assumed responsibility for managing the day to day operations of our gaylord hotels properties 
we do not have the authority to require marriott to operate our gaylord hotels properties in a particular manner  although we do have consent and approval rights for certain matters under the hotel management agreements  subject to the limitations described therein 
each of the management agreements has a term expiring in  with three automatic year renewal periods provided the applicable hotel has met certain performance thresholds 
each of the management agreements requires us to pay marriott a base management fee of of gross revenues from the applicable property for each fiscal year or portion thereof 
additionally  the pooling agreement requires us to pay marriott an incentive fee of i of pooled available cash flow which is generally operating profit for the pooled hotels less an owner s priority in each of and  ii of the first million 
table of contents of pooled available cash flow  plus of any additional pooled available cash flow over such threshold for  and iii of the first million of pooled available cash flow  plus of any additional pooled available cash flow over such threshold in or after the owner s priority is collectively million  plus certain additional amounts  including of certain non routine capital expenditures  conversion work  and non routine replacements of furniture  fixtures and equipment and routine capital expenditures in excess of a reserve 
if one or more of our gaylord hotels properties were not a pooled hotel ie  if we cease to own the hotel or we lease the hotel to a third party  the thresholds used to calculate the incentive fee in the pooling agreement will be adjusted  and the incentive fee for the non pooled hotel will be based on such hotel s performance 
the management agreements and pooling agreement also contain certain restrictions on our incurring indebtedness that encumber our gaylord hotels properties on an individual or aggregate basis 
the management agreements may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur  including the failure of marriott to satisfy certain performance standards 
the management agreements prohibit us from selling the gaylord hotels properties to certain persons  including any person who does not  in marriott s reasonable judgment  have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the management agreement  or any person who owns a controlling interest in a hotel brand eg hilton  hyatt totaling at least ten full service hotels or twenty five select service hotels  or in a group of hotels totaling at least ten full service hotels or twenty five select service hotels that are not affiliated with a brand but that are marketed and operated as a collective group  if such brand or group of hotels compete with marriott 
in addition  we may not sell a gaylord hotels property if we are then in breach of the applicable management agreement 
in addition to the marriott sale transaction  our trss entered into additional management agreements with marriott pursuant to which marriott assumed responsibility for managing the day to day operations of the general jackson showboat  gaylord springs and the wildhorse saloon beginning october   and the inn at opryland beginning december  internal reorganization 
in connection with our reit conversion  we transferred to marriott approximately  employees who worked at our various properties 
in addition  we began and continue to implement a reorganization within  and a reduction in the number of members of  our current executive management team and the other employees currently within the corporate and other segment 
in connection with the reorganization  we anticipate that our corporate overhead expenses within the corporate and other segment will be reduced 
we anticipate that we have or will terminate the employment of approximately employees within our corporate and other segment of whom approximately transitioned their employment to marriott 
the severance cost associated with these terminations  of which approximately million was accrued in  is included within our million estimate of severance and retention cost related to the reit conversion discussed further below 
costs related to reit conversion 
we have segregated all costs related to the foregoing transactions from normal operations and reported these amounts as reit conversion costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during  we incurred million of reit conversion costs  which includes million of non cash impairment charges 
excluding non cash impairment charges  we currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate of million in one time costs related to the reit conversion 
these costs would include approximately million in investment banking fees  million in other professional fees  million in employment  severance costs and retention costs  and million in various other transition costs 
we also estimate that we have incurred federal income taxes  including those associated with the receipt of the purchase price in the marriott sale transaction and other transactions related to the reit conversion  net of remaining net operating losses and credit carryforwards  of approximately million to million 
in addition  we anticipate stabilized future annualized costs synergies  net of management fees  of approximately million to million 
distribution of accumulated earnings and profits 
a reit is not permitted to retain earnings and profits accumulated during years when the company or its predecessor was taxed as a c corporation 
to qualify for taxation as a reit for the taxable year ending december   we are required to distribute to our stockholders on or before december   our undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods ending prior to january  to satisfy this requirement  on november   our board of directors declared a special dividend in the amount of per share of common stock  or an aggregate of approximately million to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november   payable on december  stockholders had the option to elect to receive the special dividend in cash or shares of common stock  with the total amount of cash payable to stockholders limited to of the total value of the special dividend  or approximately million 
cash elections exceeded the amount of cash available for distribution  and  therefore  the available cash was prorated among those stockholders that elected to receive cash  and the remainder of the special dividend was paid in shares of common stock 
on december   we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash and issued approximately million shares of common stock with a fair value of million in connection with the special dividend 
we believe that the total value of the special dividend was sufficient to fully distribute our accumulated earnings and profits  and that a portion of the special dividend exceeded our accumulated earnings and profits 
we have received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the special dividend was a taxable distribution to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes  without regard to the form of payment 
pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions in 
table of contents the indentures governing our convertible senior notes and in our call and warrant agreements  the dividend caused an adjustment to the conversion rate that was taxable to the holders of the convertible notes as of november   as well as an adjustment to the call and warrant exercise prices 
trt repurchase and public offerings on august   we entered into a repurchase agreement with our largest stockholder  trt holdings  inc trt holdings  pursuant to which we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock from trt holdings in a privately negotiated transaction for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share  which we funded with borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 
on august   trt holdings sold the remainder of its shares of our common stock  or  shares  in an underwritten secondary public offering to deutsche bank securities inc to be offered by the underwriter at a public offering price of per share 
as a result of its sale  trt holdings ceased to hold shares of our common stock 
we reimbursed of the underwriting discounts and commissions paid by trt holdings with respect to shares it sold in the secondary offering  or an aggregate of approximately million  and also paid all costs of effecting the registration for the secondary offering  other than the legal fees of trt holdings 
we did not receive any proceeds from the secondary offering 
however  in connection therewith  we granted deutsche bank securities inc the option to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock to be offered to the public at a price of per share 
deutsche bank securities inc exercised its option  and on august   we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million after the underwriter s discounts 
the repurchase agreement also contains several post closing obligations of the parties 
under a standstill provision in the repurchase agreement  trt holdings and affiliated parties of trt holdings have agreed not to take certain actions for a period of three years ending august   including acquiring beneficial ownership of any of our securities  indebtedness  or assets  making any take over bid  merger or tender offer involving us  seeking to influence or control management  our board of directors  or our policies  and participating in any proxy solicitation with respect to us 
in addition  under the repurchase agreement  we  trt holdings  and affiliated parties of trt holdings have agreed to a mutual non disparagement provision for the same period ending august  we  trt holdings  and affiliates of trt holdings have agreed to a general release of any or all past  existing  or future claims relating to matters  causes or things occurring or existing on or prior to august   subject to certain conditions contained in the repurchase agreement 
dividend policy  share repurchase program and senior note redemption on december   we announced that our board of directors approved our dividend policy  a share repurchase program and the redemption of our outstanding senior notes 
pursuant to our current dividend policy  we plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders in an amount equal to an annualized payment of at least of adjusted funds from operations as defined by ryman or of reit taxable income on an annual basis  whichever is greater 
the declaration  timing and amount of dividends will be determined by future action of our board of directors 
our dividend policy may be altered at any time by our board of directors 
on february   our board of directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share of common stock  or an aggregate of approximately million  payable on april  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march  we currently plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend of per share in july  october and january we also announced on december  that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock using cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 
the repurchases are intended to be implemented through open market transactions on us exchanges or in privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities laws  and any market purchases will be made during open trading window periods or pursuant to any applicable rule b trading plans 
the timing  prices  and sizes of repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices  general economic and market conditions and other considerations 
the repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of stock 
on january   we redeemed our remaining senior notes at par at a cost of million  which was funded using operational cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 

table of contents development update as a result of our decision to convert to a reit  we evaluated our plans and previously capitalized costs associated with potential new developments and expansions of our existing properties 
as a reit  we no longer view independent  large scale development of resort and convention hotels as a means of our growth 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements included herein  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of to write off previously capitalized costs associated with a potential future expansion of gaylord opryland and our previous development project in mesa  arizona as a result of our decision to abandon these projects 
in addition  in connection with the preparation of the financial statements included herein  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off capitalized costs associated with the previous development project in aurora  colorado 
while we continue to view aurora as a viable market  we have concluded that if and when our participation in the project moves forward  it should proceed under the direction and leadership of an unrelated third party who will most likely use its own resources to complete the project 
as such  we do not believe that we will be able to realize our previous investment in the project 
our investments in and consisted primarily of a new resort pool at gaylord texan  the renovation of the guestrooms  the addition of a sports bar entertainment facility and new resort pools at gaylord palms  the completion of the enhancement to our flood protection system at gaylord opryland and the grand old opry house  and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties 
our investments in are expected to consist primarily of ongoing maintenance capital expenditures for our existing properties  the renovation of a portion of the rooms at gaylord texan the remaining to be completed in  and the renovation of the suites at gaylord palms 
our current operations our ongoing operations are organized into three principal business segments hospitality  consisting of gaylord opryland  gaylord palms  gaylord texan  gaylord national and the inn at opryland 
beginning october   marriott assumed responsibility for the day to day management of our gaylord hotels properties 
effective december   under an additional management agreement  marriott assumed responsibility for managing the day to day operations of the inn at opryland 
opry and attractions  consisting of our grand ole opry assets  wsm am and our nashville attractions 
as a result of the reit conversion  we own our opry and attractions businesses in trss  which will conduct their business consistent with past practice  except for the management agreements for the general jackson  wildhorse saloon and gaylord springs discussed above 
corporate and other  consisting of our corporate expenses 
we anticipate that our corporate overhead expenses within our corporate and other segment will be reduced as a result of the reit conversion 
for the years ended december  our total revenues were divided among these business segments as follows segment hospitality opry and attractions corporate and other our goal is to become the nation s premier hospitality reit for group oriented meetings hotel assets located in urban and resort markets 
we intend to leverage our existing hotel properties that continue the all in one place self contained service offerings  as well as a longer term growth strategy that includes acquisitions of hotels  particularly in the group meetings sector of the hospitality industry  either alone or through joint venture or alliances with one or more third parties 
we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities which meet our acquisition parameters  specifically  group oriented large hotels and overflow hotels with existing or potential leisure appeal 

table of contents key performance indicators the operating results of our hospitality segment as managed by marriott are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our hotels and the quality of the customer mix at our hotels 
these factors impact the price that our third party managers can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities  such as food and beverage and meeting space 
key performance indicators related to revenue are hotel occupancy a volume indicator  average daily rate adr a price indicator calculated by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms sold  revenue per available room revpar a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing room revenue by room nights available to guests for the period  total revenue per available room total revpar a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of room  food and beverage and other ancillary service revenue by room nights available to guests for the period  and net definite room nights booked a volume indicator which represents the total number of definite bookings for future room nights at our hotels confirmed during the applicable period  net of cancellations 
hospitality segment revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale 
attrition fees  which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for  as well as cancellation fees  are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected 
almost all of our hospitality segment revenues are either cash based or  for meeting and convention groups meeting credit criteria  billed and collected on a short term receivables basis 
the hospitality industry is capital intensive  and we rely on the ability of our hotels to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing and fund maintenance capital expenditures 
the results of operations of our hospitality segment are affected by the number and type of group meetings and conventions scheduled to attend our hotels in a given period 
our hotels attempt to offset any identified shortfalls in occupancy by creating special events or offering incentives to groups in order to attract increased business during this period 
a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim period  including the nature and quality of the group meetings and conventions attending our hotels during such period  which meetings and conventions have often been contracted for several years in advance  the level of attrition our hotels experience  and the level of transient business at our hotels during such period

cash flows from financing activities 
during  our net cash flows used in financing activities continuing operations were million  primarily reflecting the payment of million related to the repurchase and retirement of million shares of our common stock from trt holdings  the payment of the cash portion of the special dividend paid to stockholders on december  of million  and million in net repayments under our million credit facility  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock in a public offering  and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchase plans

working capital as of december  we had total current assets of million and total current liabilities of million  which resulted in a working capital deficit of million 
a significant portion of our current liabilities consist of deferred revenues million at december   which primarily represent deposits received on advance bookings of hotel rooms 
while satisfaction of these deferred revenue liabilities will require the use of hotel resources and services  it does not require future cash payments by us 
in addition  as further described below  our convertible notes are currently convertible through march  based on our borrowing capacity under our million credit facility at december   million of these convertible notes has been classified as short term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
at this time  we have not processed any convertible notes for conversion 
we believe our current assets  cash flows from operating activities and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to repay our current liabilities as they become due 

table of contents liquidity as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and million available for borrowing under our million credit facility  which matures in during  we received million from the marriott sale transaction and received approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock 
these inflows  as well as the cash flows from operating activities discussed above  partially offset by the payment of million related to the repurchase and retirement of million shares of our common stock from trt holdings  capital expenditures of million  the payment of the cash portion of the special dividend paid to our stockholders on december  of million and the repayment of million under our million credit facility  were the primary factors in the increase in our cash balance from to we anticipate that i we will incur federal income taxes  including those associated with the receipt of the purchase price and other transactions related to the reit conversion  net of remaining net operating losses  of approximately million to million  and ii we will incur one time costs related to the reit conversion  including conversion  transaction  severance  and retention costs  but excluding non cash impairment costs  currently estimated to be million of which approximately million have already been incurred 
in addition  on january   we redeemed our remaining senior notes at par at a cost of million  which was funded using operational cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 
finally  on february   our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of per share of common stock  or an aggregate of approximately million  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march   payable on april  we currently plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend of per share in july  october and january as further described above  we anticipate investing in our operations during by spending between million and million in capital expenditures  which include million to million in ongoing maintenance capital in our hospitality segment  approximately million in ongoing maintenance capital in our opry and attractions segment  and approximately million in other projects 
in addition  on december   we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock using cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash from operations will be adequate to fund these short term commitments  as well as i normal operating expenses  ii interest expense on long term debt obligations  and iii capital lease and operating lease obligations 
if our existing cash and cash from operations were inadequate to fund such commitments  we could draw on our million credit facility  subject to the satisfaction of covenants in the credit facility 
we believe that drawing on this credit facility will not be necessary for general working capital purposes 
we may  however  draw on our million credit facility for operational and capital needs in the future 
our outstanding principal debt agreements  none of which mature prior to  are described below 
based on current projections for compliance under our financial covenants contained in the credit agreement for our million credit facility  we do not foresee a maturity issue prior to we may seek opportunities to refinance our indebtedness in if interest rates and terms are favorable

the million credit facility also includes an accordion feature that will allow us to increase the facility by a total of up to million  subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions 
the million credit facility matures on august  and bears interest at an annual rate of libor plus an adjustable margin based on our implied debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement the applicable margin  or the bank s base rate plus the applicable margin 
interest on our borrowings is payable quarterly  in arrears  for base rate loans and at the end of each interest rate period for libor based loans

the million credit facility is cross defaulted to our other indebtedness 
we refinanced our previous billion credit facility by entering into the million credit facility on august  as a result of the refinancing  we wrote off million of deferred financing costs  which are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the million credit facility  and the lending banks had issued million of letters of credit under the facility for us  which left million of availability under the credit facility 
during january  we drew million under the million credit facility in order to redeem at par all of our outstanding senior notes 

table of contents convertible senior notes 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes the convertible notes 
the convertible notes have a maturity date of october   and interest is payable semiannually in cash in arrears on april and october the convertible notes are convertible  under certain circumstances as described below  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock  at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
as a result of our declaration of the special dividend paid to stockholders on december   pursuant to anti dilution provisions included in the indenture for the convertible notes  the conversion rate of the convertible notes was adjusted to shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes on november   which is equivalent to a conversion price of per share 
we may elect  at our option  to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligations upon conversion of the convertible notes 
we intend to settle the face value of the convertible notes in cash 
in addition  in accordance with customary anti dilution provisions  the strike price of the call options we purchased was adjusted to per share of our common stock  which will enable us to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
further  the exercise price of the common stock purchase warrants we sold was adjusted to per share 
the convertible notes are convertible under any of the following circumstances during any calendar quarter ending after september  and only during such calendar quarter  if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the ten business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price as defined in the indenture per  principal amount of the convertible notes  as determined following a request by a convertible note holder  for each day in such five consecutive trading day period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate  subject to certain procedures  if specified corporate transactions or events occur  or at any time on or after july   until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding october  based on our stock price during the three months ended december   the first condition permitting conversion of the convertible notes was satisfied and  thus  the convertible notes are currently convertible through march  at this time  we have not processed any of the convertible notes for conversion 
based on our borrowing capacity under the million credit facility  million of the convertible notes has been classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on our december  closing stock price of  the if converted value of the convertible notes exceeds the face amount by million  however  after giving effect to the exercise of the call options and warrants associated with the convertible notes as described below  the incremental cash or share settlement in excess of the face amount would result in either a cash payment of million or a million net share issuance  or a combination of cash and stock  at our option 
based on our cash on hand and our availability under the million credit facility as of december   we do not expect any liquidity issues should the convertible notes be converted 
the convertible notes are general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness  which prior to january  included our senior notes  and senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness  if any 
the convertible notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 
the convertible notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that are borrowers under or guarantors of our credit facility 
each guarantee will rank equally in right of payment with such subsidiary guarantor s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness  if any  of such subsidiary guarantor 
the convertible notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the convertible notes 
upon a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for our convertible notes  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  if any  thereon to but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date as defined in the indenture for our convertible notes 
the convertible notes are not redeemable at our option prior to maturity 
we do not believe the reit conversion resulted in a fundamental change 
the conversion rate of the convertible notes will be adjusted in connection with any special or regular dividends we pay pursuant to customary anti dilution provisions of the indenture governing the convertible notes  which will result in additional shares of our common stock becoming issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes 

table of contents senior notes 
on january   we redeemed our remaining senior notes the senior notes at par at a cost of million  which was funded using operational cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit line of our million credit facility 
as a result of this redemption  we will write off million of deferred financing costs in the first quarter of we completed our offering of million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes in the senior notes were scheduled to mature on november   and bore interest at interest  payable semi annually in cash in arrears on may and november of each year 
the senior notes were redeemable  in whole or in part  at any time on or after november  at a designated redemption amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the senior notes ranked equally in right of payment with our other unsecured unsubordinated debt  but were effectively subordinated to all of our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt 
the senior notes were guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by generally most of our significant active domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  the senior notes indenture contained certain covenants which  among other things  limited the incurrence of additional indebtedness including additional indebtedness under the term loan portion of our million credit facility  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  capital expenditures  mergers and consolidations  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the senior notes were cross defaulted to our other indebtedness 
additional debt limitations 
pursuant to the terms of the management agreements and pooling agreement with marriott  we are subject to certain debt limitations described below 
the management agreements provide for the following limitations on indebtedness encumbering a hotel the aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the hotel shall be no greater than of the fair market value of the hotel  and the ratio of a aggregate operating profit as defined in the management agreement in the months prior to the closing on the mortgage or mezzanine debt to b annual debt service for the hotel shall equal or exceed  but is subject to the pooling agreement described below 
the pooled limitations on secured debt as defined in the pooling agreement are as follows the aggregate principal balance of all mortgage and mezzanine debt on pooled hotels as defined in the pooling agreement  shall be no more than of the fair market value of pooled hotels 
the ratio of a aggregate operating profit as defined in the pooling agreement of pooled hotels in the months prior to closing on any mortgage or mezzanine debt  to b annual debt service for the pooled hotels  shall equal or exceed off balance sheet arrangements we previously invested in two unconsolidated entities that owned hotels located in hawaii  which is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
our joint venture partner in each of these unconsolidated entities guaranteed  under certain circumstances  certain loans made to wholly owned subsidiaries of each of these entities  and we agreed to contribute to these joint venture partners our pro rata share of any payments under such guarantees required to be made by such joint venture partners 
in addition  we enter into commitments under letters of credit  primarily for the purpose of securing our deductible obligations with our workers compensation insurers 
as of december   the lending banks under the million credit facility had issued million of letters of credit for us 
except as set forth in this paragraph  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december   including long term debt and operating and capital lease commitments amounts in thousands contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases construction commitments other total contractual obligations long term debt commitments do not include approximately million in interest payments projected to be due in future years less than year million  years million based on the stated interest rates on our fixed rate debt and the rates in effect at december  for our variable rate debt 
variable rates  as well as outstanding principal balances  could change in future periods 
see principal debt agreements above for a discussion of our outstanding long term debt 
see supplemental cash flow information in note to our consolidated financial statements included herewith for a discussion of the interest we paid during  and total long term debt commitments due in years of billion includes million of the convertible notes  which are currently convertible through march   and million of the senior notes  which we redeemed at par on january  using operational cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit line of the million credit facility 
total operating lease commitments of million includes the year operating lease agreement we entered into during for acres of land located in osceola county  florida where gaylord palms is located 
with respect to our hotels that are operated under management agreements with marriott  we are obligated to maintain an ff e reserve account for future planned and emergency related capital expenditures at these hotels 
the amount funded into each of these reserve accounts is determined pursuant to the management agreements 
for fiscal year  the amount funded into the reserve accounts will be of the respective hotel s total annual revenue 
as of december   million was held in ff e reserve accounts for future capital expenditures at our hotels 
according to the terms of each hotel management agreement with marriott  the reserve funds are to be held by marriott in a restricted cash account 
although it is not required that such funds be expended in a given year  each hotel management agreement provides any excess funds will carry over for use in future years 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash payments associated with our defined benefit pension plan  our non qualified retirement plan  our non qualified contributory deferred compensation plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan  we cannot make reasonably certain estimates of the period of cash settlement 
therefore  these obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
during  we expect to contribute million and million  respectively  to our defined benefit pension plan and our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plan 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion related to these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates 

table of contents this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
revenue from our occupied hotel rooms is recognized as earned on the close of business each day and from concessions and food and beverage sales at the time of the sale 
revenues from other services at our hotels  such as spa  parking  and transportation services are recognized at the time services are provided 
attrition fees  which are charged to groups when they do not fulfill the minimum number of room nights or minimum food and beverage spending requirements originally contracted for  as well as cancellation fees  are recognized as revenue in the period they are collected 
revenues from the opry and attractions segment are recognized when services are provided or goods are shipped  as applicable 
impairment of long lived and other assets 
in accounting for our long lived and other assets including our notes receivable associated with the development of gaylord national  we assess our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets that will continue to be used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset or asset group s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset group is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  which is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses that utilize comprehensive cash flow projections  as well as observable market data to the extent available 
other than as necessary as a result of the reit conversion  as discussed above  no impairment charges on long lived assets were recorded during stock based compensation 
we record compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option award granted on a straight line basis over the option s vesting period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend yield  and expected risk free rate of return 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes merton option pricing formula change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the assumptions for expected volatility  expected term  and expected dividend yield are the assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected risk free rate of return is not significant to the calculation of fair value 
derivative financial instruments 
we are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations 
the primary risks occasionally managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate swaps are entered into from time to time to manage interest rate risk associated with portions of our fixed and variable rate borrowings 
natural gas price swaps are entered into from time to time to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity used by our hotels 
we designate certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate borrowings  the remaining interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed rate borrowings  and natural gas price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings eg  in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with variable rate debt 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  or ineffectiveness  if any  is recognized in the statement of operations during the current period 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  is recognized in the same line item associated with the hedged item in current earnings eg  in interest expense when the hedged item is fixed rate debt 

table of contents we determine the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities based on quotes  with appropriate adjustments for any significant impact of non performance risk of the parties to the contracts 
the key input used to determine the fair value of our previous variable to fixed interest rate swaps was changes in libor interest rates 
the key input used to determine the fair value of our previous variable to fixed natural gas price swaps was the forward price of natural gas futures contracts for delivery at the henry hub as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
we believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time the estimates were made 
we held no derivative positions at december  income taxes 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes is increased by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  against the estimated deferred tax assets that will not ultimately be recoverable 
we have state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which management believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies  which involve estimates and uncertainties  in making this assessment 
projected future taxable income is based on management s forecast of our operating results 
management periodically reviews such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends 
we have established valuation allowances for certain federal and state deferred tax assets 
at december   we had no federal net operating loss or federal credit carryforwards  and had charitable contribution carryforwards of million resulting in a deferred tax benefit of million 
a valuation allowance of million has been provided for certain federal deferred tax assets  including charitable contribution carryforwards  as of december  at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million resulting in a deferred tax benefit of million and state credit carryforwards of million 
a valuation allowance of million has been provided for certain state deferred tax assets  including loss and credit carryforwards  as of december  in the event management determines that a change in the realizability of these deferred tax assets is necessary  we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowance in the period in which the determination is made 
in addition  we must deal with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the calculation of tax liabilities and are subject to routine income tax audits 
we provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
we make this assessment based on only the technical merits of the tax position 
the technical merits of a tax position derive from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings  and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements and a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is established 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
to the extent that we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability established  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
retirement and postretirement benefits other than pension plans 
the costs and obligations of our retirement and postretirement benefits other than pension plans recognized in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial valuations  which are dependent on significant assumptions  judgments  and estimates 
these assumptions  judgments  and estimates  which include discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at the measurement date  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates  are evaluated at each annual measurement date 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions  judgments  and estimates are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the discount rate utilized for determining future benefit obligations is based on the market rate of a broad based index of high quality bonds receiving an aa or better rating from a recognized rating agency on our annual measurement date that is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the resulting discount rate decreased from for the retirement plan and for the postretirement benefits other than pension plans at december  to and  respectively  at december  
table of contents we determine the overall expected long term return on plan assets based on our estimate of the return that plan assets will provide over the period that benefits are expected to be paid out 
in preparing this estimate  we assess the rates of return on each allocation of plan assets  return premiums generated by portfolio management  and advice by our third party actuary and investment consultants 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption that is determined at the beginning of each year and generally does not significantly change annually 
while historical returns are considered  the rate of return assumption is primarily based on projections of expected returns  using economic data and financial models to estimate the probability of returns 
the probability distribution of annualized returns for the portfolio using current asset allocations is used to determine the expected range of returns for a ten to twenty year horizon 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension expense 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for and was and  respectively 
actual return on plan assets for and was and  respectively 
our historical actual return averaged for the ten year period ended december  in the future  we may make additional discretionary contributions to the plan or we could be required to make mandatory cash funding payments 
the mortality rate assumption used for determining future benefit obligations as of december  and was based on the rp mortality tables 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider our actual health care cost experience  industry trends  and advice from our third party actuary 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expense 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate related to the retirement plan would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
likewise  a increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase  respectively  net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
legal contingencies 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances 
recently issued accounting standards for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposures to market risk are from changes in interest rates and equity prices and changes in asset values of investments that fund our pension plan 
risk related to changes in interest rates borrowings outstanding under our million credit facility currently bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus  subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement 
if libor were to increase by basis points  our annual interest cost on the million in borrowings outstanding under our million credit facility as of december  would increase by approximately million 
certain of our outstanding cash balances are occasionally invested overnight with high credit quality financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at december  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   if any  is low 

table of contents risk related to changes in equity prices the million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes may be converted prior to maturity  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances as described in item above under principal debt agreements 
upon conversion  we may elect  at our option  to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligations to the converting note holders 
the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as our share price increases and decrease as our share price declines 
concurrently with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the convertible notes  at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the convertible notes 
in connection with the convertible note hedge transactions  we purchased call options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution adjustments  at a price per share equal to  the initial conversion price of the convertible notes  from counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers of the convertible notes 
separately we sold warrants to the counterparties to the call options whereby they may purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in accordance with anti dilution provisions included in the indenture for the convertible notes and as a result of our declaration of the special dividend paid to stockholders on december   on november  the number of shares covered by and the exercise price of the call options we purchased were adjusted to million shares and per share  respectively 
the number of shares covered by and the exercise price of the common stock purchase warrants we sold were adjusted to million shares and per share  respectively 
following these adjustments  the convertible notes will not have a dilutive impact on shares outstanding if the share price of our common stock is below the warrant exercise price 
for every increase in the share price of our common stock above  we will be required to deliver  upon the exercise of the warrants  the equivalent of million in shares of our common stock at the relevant share price 
pursuant to anti dilution provisions  the conversion price of the convertible notes and the exercise prices of the call options and warrants will be adjusted for future cash dividends 
risk related to changes in asset values that fund our pension plans the expected rates of return on the assets that fund our defined benefit pension plan are based on the asset allocation of the plan and the long term projected return on those assets  which represent a diversified mix of equity securities  fixed income securities and cash 
as of december   the value of the investments in the pension fund was million  and an immediate ten percent decrease in the value of the investments in the fund would have reduced the value of the fund by approximately million 
summary based upon our overall market risk exposures at december   we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates  equity prices and asset values of investments that fund our pension plan could be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
