table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products and services 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber  concrete and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  with manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom  denmark and the netherlands 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
through our cm c business  we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote  naphthalene and phthalic anhydride  which are intermediate materials necessary in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood and the production of carbon black  the production of high strength concrete  and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
through our r up business  we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the north american railroads 
our other commercial wood treatment products include utility poles for the electric and telephone utility industries in north america and australia 
we also provide rail joint bar products as well as various services to the railroad industry 
in october we entered into an agreement with nippon steel and sumikin chemical and several other entities to develop and construct a fully integrated coal tar based carbon products complex in pizhou city  jiangsu province  china 
the complex will include a  metric ton tar distillation facility that will be majority owned by koppers  as well as a carbon black plant and a needle coke plant that will be owned by nippon steel and sumikin chemical 
a significant portion of the products produced at the tar distillation plant will be sold under a long term supply contract with nippon steel and sumikin chemical to supply their carbon black and needle coke plants 
the project has commenced and construction of the tar distillation plant is expected to be completed in mid outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products  ii raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which is negatively affected by reductions in steel production  iii volatility in oil prices  which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials  as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  iv competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  and v changes in foreign exchange rates 
the availability of coal tar is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production 
as the global steel industry has reduced production of steel and metallurgical coke  the volumes of coal tar by product were also reduced 
our ability to obtain coal tar and the price we are able to negotiate has a significant impact on the level of profitability of our business 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs can result in margin dilution if only the increased cost of the raw material is passed on to the customer 
additionally  in certain regions such as china that have competing markets for coal tar  or in regions where the available supply of our products exceeds demand  we may not be able to recover raw material cost increases in the selling prices for our end products 
the primary product produced by cm c is carbon pitch  which is sold primarily to the aluminum industry to be used in the production of carbon anodes 
the smelting of aluminum requires significant amounts of energy  which is a major cost component for the aluminum industry 
as a result  new production facilities are being built in regions with low energy costs such as the middle east  while regions with higher energy costs such as the united states and western europe have seen significant amounts of smelting capacity idled or closed over the last several years 
in late and early  reductions in aluminum pricing resulted in additional closures and curtailments in europe and australia that have resulted in lower sales volumes of carbon pitch for us in those regions 
while we expect to recover some of 
table of contents these lower volumes from operations in china  margins may be negatively affected as our increased presence in asia has had a dilutive effect on margins due to market conditions in that region as well as the joint venture ownership structures of our chinese operations 
our businesses and results of operations were negatively affected in by difficult economic conditions in europe 
certain key end markets experienced significant reductions in demand that have negatively affected the profitability for some of our products produced and sold in europe  and we expect this to continue through several of our products  particularly carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  have end market pricing that is linked to oil 
historically  when oil prices increase we have benefited in terms of revenues and profitability from the higher pricing for these products as the cost of coal tar has not increased proportionally with oil 
however  over the past few years  our coal tar costs have demonstrated a stronger correlation with the price of oil  which has resulted in higher raw material and finished product costs as the price of oil has increased 
in response  we have instituted price increases in an attempt to recover the higher coal tar costs from our customers 
the primary end market for r up is the north american railroad industry  which has a large installed base of wood crossties that require periodic replacement 
as a result  our volumes for crossties and our operating results for this business have historically been relatively stable 
however  our railroad business can be negatively affected by weather conditions that make it difficult for sawmills that provide our raw material to harvest timber from the forests 
additionally  some of our class i railroad customers  who make up the largest portion of our business  may reduce inventory levels at certain times to manage working capital  which can adversely affect our volumes and profitability during certain periods 
we also sell crossties to commercial customers consisting primarily of short line railroads  whose buying patterns have historically been influenced by general economic conditions 
as a result  during recessionary periods  sales volumes to our commercial customers have typically been reduced  resulting in lower revenues and profitability for our business 
seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have at times been reduced during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have been significantly lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products 
table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report carbon materials chemicals net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or six percent 
sales volumes for distillates increased sales by six percent over the prior year due to higher sales volumes of carbon black feedstock for chinese operations combined with higher sales volumes of carbon black feedstock from australian operations to third parties as a result of the closure of our carbon black plant in sales prices for distillates increased sales by two percent due mainly to higher oil prices 
sales prices for pitch increased sales by five percent due to higher raw material costs  and were partially offset by lower sales volumes for pitch of four percent of sales as lower sales volumes for north america  australia and europe were partially offset by higher sales volumes from chinese operations 
the lower sales volumes were due mainly to aluminum smelter closures and production cutbacks 
foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in sales of two percent 
railroad utility products net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or six percent 
sales prices for railroad crossties increased sales by five percent and were partially offset by lower sales volumes for crossties of two percent of sales for the year ended december   with the higher sales prices driven mainly by higher sales volumes of value added products to our class i railroad customers

koppers inc s credit agreement prohibits it from making dividend payments to us unless such dividend payments are permitted by the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes and no event of default or potential default has occurred or is continuing under the credit agreement 
the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes restricts its ability to finance our payment of dividends if a default has occurred or would result from such financing  a restricted subsidiary of koppers inc which is not a guarantor under the indenture is not able to incur additional indebtedness as defined in the indenture  and the sum of all restricted payments as defined in the indenture have exceeded the permitted amount which we refer to as the basket at such point in time 
the basket is governed by a formula based on the sum of a beginning amount  plus or minus a percentage of koppers inc s consolidated net income as defined in the indenture  plus the net proceeds of koppers inc s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock  plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment as defined in the indenture or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary 
at december  the basket totaled million 
notwithstanding such restrictions  the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes permits an additional aggregate amount of million each fiscal year to finance dividends on the capital stock of koppers holdings  whether or not there is any basket availability  provided that at the time of such payment  no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends 
in addition  certain required coverage ratios in koppers inc s revolving credit facility may restrict the ability of koppers inc to pay dividends 
see debt covenants 
liquidity the koppers inc revolving credit facility agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million at variable interest rates 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of koppers inc and its material domestic subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants for koppers inc and its restricted subsidiaries that limit capital expenditures  additional indebtedness  liens  dividends and investments or acquisitions 
in addition  such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by koppers inc and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios 
as of december   we had million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments 
as of december   million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit 

table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report the following table summarizes our estimated liquidity as of december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents amount available under revolving credit facility amount available under other credit facilities total estimated liquidity cash includes approximately million held by foreign subsidiaries  which if repatriated to the united states  would incur an estimated cash tax cost of approximately million 
our estimated liquidity was million at december  the increase in estimated liquidity from that date is due primarily to an increase in cash and an increase in the availability under the revolving credit facility due to lower borrowings at the end of the year 
in june  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which gives us the opportunity to offer common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants and units or a combination of these securities from time to time in one or more offerings 
in addition  koppers inc may sell debt securities from time to time under the registration statement 
this registration statement expires in june our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service  purchase commitments and operating leases  as well as working capital  capital maintenance programs and mandatory and voluntary defined benefit plan funding 
we may also use cash to pursue potential strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  are expected to total approximately million 
in october  a subsidiary of the company signed an agreement to construct a coal tar distillation facility in china 
construction is expected to commence in early and be completed by mid the company s expected future capital requirement commitment for the majority owned facility is approximately million and will be financed by available cash and incremental financing 
a significant portion of the capital requirements will be provided over the next months 
schedule of certain contractual obligations the following table details our projected payments for our significant contractual obligations as of december  the table is based upon available information and certain assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
payments due by period total later years in millions long term debt including accretion interest on debt operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations consists primarily of raw materials purchase contracts 
these are typically not fixed price arrangements  the prices are based on the prevailing market prices 
as a result  we generally expect to be able to hedge the purchases with sales at those future prices 
pension and other employee benefit plan funding obligations for defined benefit plans are not included in the table above 
we expect defined benefit plan contributions to total approximately million in estimated funding obligations are determined by asset performance  workforce and retiree demographics  tax and employment laws and other actuarial assumptions which may change the annual funding obligations in addition to decisions to fund in excess of statutorily required amounts
