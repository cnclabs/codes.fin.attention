item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended august   and the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in part ii  item of this report and the selected financial data contained in part ii  item of this report 
business we are one of the nation s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal  a leading recycler of used and salvaged vehicles and a manufacturer of finished steel products 
we operate in three reporting segments the metals recycling business mrb  the auto parts business apb and the steel manufacturing business smb  which collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through our integrated businesses 
we use operating income loss to measure our segment performance 
restructuring charges are not allocated to the segment operating income loss because we do not include this information in our measurement of the segments performance 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expense for management and administrative services that benefit all three reporting segments 
as a result of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each reporting segment does not reflect the operating income loss the reporting segment would report as a stand alone business 
for further information regarding our reporting segments  including financial information about geographic areas  see note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
mrb buys  collects  processes  recycles  sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous scrap metal not containing iron to both foreign and domestic markets 
mrb processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing  sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size  density and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb procures used and salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies and major parts containing ferrous and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
mrb is the sole supplier for smb s scrap metal requirements  which smb purchases at rates that approximate export market prices for shipments from the west coast of the us smb uses its mini mill near portland  oregon to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains a mill depot in southern california 
our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials  including end of life vehicles  available to be processed at our facilities 
our deep water port facilities on both the east and west coasts of the us in everett  massachusetts  providence  rhode island  oakland  california  portland  oregon  and tacoma  washington and access to public deep water port facilities in kapolei  hawaii  and salinas  puerto rico allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for recycled ferrous metal by shipping bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  central america and africa 
our exports of nonferrous processed recycled metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers  foundries  aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and smelters  brass and bronze ingot manufacturers and wire and cable producers globally 
we also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck  rail and barge in order to transfer scrap metal between our facilities for further processing  to load shipments at our export facilities and to meet regional domestic demand 
key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate we sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel 
our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the us and western canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the western us fluctuating or volatile supply and demand conditions affect market prices for and volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and for steel products in the western us and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for all three reporting segments 
in fiscal and throughout fiscal  our markets were significantly impacted by a slowdown of economic activity globally 
macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in deteriorating market conditions for global steel manufacturers and volatile pricing swings with an overall downward trend in commodity prices and export selling prices of recycled materials 
the persistently low economic growth in the us contributed to constrained scrap flows in our mrb and apb domestic supply markets which  combined with schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents schnitzer steel industries  inc 
increased scrap recycling capacity in certain regional markets  led to continued margin compression 
in addition  a relatively stronger us dollar value increased competitive pressure on mrb s export activity 
strategic factors as we continue to closely monitor economic conditions  we remain focused on the following core strategies to meet our business objectives use of our seven deep water ports to access customers directly around the world and to meet demand wherever it is greatest  synergistic growth and continuous improvement and cost reduction initiatives which further integrate our operations and drive significant cost savings and efficiencies  growth through acquisitions and greenfield development in existing and new geographic regions that generate attractive returns  and continued investment in and benefit from technologies and process improvements which increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process 
our strategy is focused on enhancing the inherent synergies within our integrated operations while continuing to grow our operations in core regions where we have a significant market presence and competitively advantageous port access 
apb is a key supplier to mrb  and we opportunistically look to enhance the geographic proximity of operations within the two businesses 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of two metals recycling businesses in canada  with a total of twelve metals collection and processing facilities  which marked mrb s first expansion into canada 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of an additional metals recycling business in canada 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of a used auto parts business with four stores in british columbia  expanding apb s existing presence in western canada 
apb s facilities in western canada are able to provide crushed autobodies to mrb s new franchise in western canada in addition to shipping to its tacoma  washington facility 
also in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of two auto parts businesses with three stores in massachusetts and rhode island  establishing a new apb presence in the northeastern us near mrb s operations 
mrb and apb also have an integrated presence in the northwestern us and in northern california  near mrb s export facilities in tacoma  washington and oakland  california  which benefit from the synergies of this enhanced access to supply 
during fiscal we continued to implement enhancements to the synergies between these businesses by integrating certain operational processes 
executive overview of financial results we generated consolidated revenues of billion in fiscal  a decrease of from the billion of consolidated revenues in the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower sales volumes and lower average net selling prices for ferrous metal primarily as a result of weak economic conditions that negatively impacted demand for recycled metal and the lower price environment which adversely impacted the supply of raw materials compared to the prior year 
we generated an operating loss of million in fiscal  which included a goodwill impairment charge of million  other asset impairment charges of million and restructuring charges of million  compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
adjusted operating income in fiscal  excluding goodwill and other asset impairments and the restructuring charges  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to adjusted operating income in fiscal see the reconciliation of adjusted consolidated operating income in non gaap financial measures at the end of item 
operating results in fiscal were negatively impacted by the reduction in sales volumes compared to the prior year 
the constrained supply of raw materials in our domestic markets  coupled with a more pronounced softening of demand for scrap metal in the export markets compared to the us  caused purchase prices for raw materials to decrease less than export selling prices  contributing to the compression in operating margins in fiscal furthermore  in the declining selling price environment  average inventory costs did not decrease as quickly as purchase costs for raw materials  resulting in an adverse effect on cost of goods sold compared to the prior year 
consolidated operating results in fiscal also included million of operating losses  including transaction  integration and startup costs  related to store locations acquired or opened by apb during fiscal these decreases were offset by an increase in operating income at smb of million compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of slightly improved demand leading to higher sales volumes and increased utilization levels 
in addition  consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the restructuring initiatives and other operating efficiencies announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal which were implemented in fiscal schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents schnitzer steel industries  inc 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified the combination of the continued challenging market conditions  the constrained supply of raw materials  the company s recent financial performance and the lack of recovery of our market capitalization as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill allocated to our reporting units 
the impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at the mrb reporting unit 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million on various other assets 
in fiscal  we made further progress on our growth strategy through the integration of nine stores acquired in fiscal and the opening of two greenfield store locations in apb 
in mrb  our new shredder and processing equipment in surrey  british columbia became operational and our nonferrous processing facility in puerto rico neared completion and became operational in september in addition  in march we acquired the redeemable noncontrolling interest in one of mrb s canadian subsidiaries for consideration of million

corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
as a consequence of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each segment does not reflect the operating income loss the segment would report as a stand alone business 
the joint ventures sell recycled ferrous metal to mrb and then subsequently to smb at rates per ton that approximate west coast us export market prices 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income loss  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore  intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory 
restructuring charges consist of expense for severance  contract termination and other exit costs that management does not include in its measurement of the performance of the operating segments 
intercompany profits are not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties  therefore  intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory 
revenues fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased due to lower sales volumes and lower average net selling prices for recycled ferrous metal 
during fiscal  demand for recycled scrap metal continued to soften due primarily to weak global macroeconomic conditions  which led to a decline in selling prices as compared to the prior year 
selling prices of recycled ferrous metal declined sharply at the beginning of fiscal and  after experiencing a slight increase in the second quarter  steadily declined throughout the remainder of fiscal in addition  the lower price environment adversely impacted the supply of raw materials compared to the prior year which contributed to the lower sales volumes 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes of ferrous scrap metal as a result of soft global demand and constrained supply of raw materials 
operating income loss fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated operating loss in fiscal was million  which included a goodwill impairment charge of million  other asset impairment charges of million and restructuring charges of million  compared to consolidated operating income of million in the prior year 
adjusted consolidated operating income in fiscal  excluding the goodwill impairment charge  other asset impairment charges and the restructuring charges  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to adjusted consolidated operating income of million in fiscal see the reconciliation of adjusted consolidated operating income in non gaap financial measures at the end of item 
operating results in fiscal were negatively impacted by the reduction in sales volumes compared to the prior year  which benefited from higher sales volumes and higher average net selling prices resulting in less margin compression compared to fiscal the constrained supply of raw materials in our domestic markets  coupled with a more pronounced softening of demand for scrap metal in the export markets compared to the us  caused purchase prices for raw materials to decrease less than export selling prices  contributing to the compression in operating margins in fiscal furthermore  in the declining selling price environment  average inventory costs did not decrease as quickly as purchase costs for raw materials  resulting in an adverse effect on cost of goods sold and a further compression of operating margins compared to the prior year 
consolidated operating results in fiscal also included million of operating losses at apb  including transaction  integration and startup costs  related to the eleven store locations acquired or opened during fiscal these decreases were offset by an increase in operating income at smb of million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of slightly improved demand leading to higher sales volumes and increased utilization levels 
operating results in fiscal benefited from a reduction in selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million  or  from the prior year  primarily as a result of the restructuring initiatives and other operating efficiencies announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and implemented in fiscal the decrease compared to the prior year was driven primarily by a reduction of million in employee compensation expense and million in professional and outside services 
the reduction in consolidated sg a expense was achieved despite the incremental expense attributable to the eleven store locations acquired or opened by apb during fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified the combination of the continued challenging market conditions  the constrained supply of raw materials  the company s recent financial performance and the lack of recovery of our market capitalization as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill allocated to our reporting units 
for the apb reporting unit  the calculated fair value using the income approach substantially exceeded its carrying value 
for the mrb reporting unit  the first step of the impairment test showed that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying amount  indicating a potential impairment 
based on the second step of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at mrb 
schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents schnitzer steel industries  inc 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we also recorded impairment charges of million on various other assets at mrb  including the impairment of a contractual receivable of million as a result of the debtor s inability to repay the amount owed in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the extraction of scrap metal through demolition activities  and impairments of million on a combination of assets held for sale  a joint venture investment and other long lived assets 
consolidated operating income in fiscal also included restructuring charges of million compared to million in fiscal  consisting of severance  contract termination and other exit costs in connection with initiatives designed to extract greater synergies from the significant acquisitions and technology investments made in recent years  to achieve further integration between mrb and apb  to realign our organization to support future growth and to decrease operating expenses by streamlining functions and reducing organizational layers 
these initiatives  which were completed by the end of fiscal  achieved a reduction in operating costs of approximately million on an annualized basis  comprising approximately million of selling  general and administrative expense and million of cost of goods sold 
total pre tax charges pursuant to these restructuring initiatives were approximately million 
the vast majority of the restructuring charges required us to make cash payments 
following is a summary of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal and by major type of cost and the total charges expected to be incurred pursuant to these restructuring initiatives in thousands charges in fiscal charges in fiscal total charges to date total expected charges mrb apb corporate total severance costs contract termination costs other exit costs total we plan to initiate and implement additional restructuring initiatives in fiscal to further reduce our annual operating expenses by approximately million  with approximately of the reduction expected to benefit fiscal results and the full annual benefit expected to be achieved in fiscal the reduction in operating expenses will primarily occur at mrb and is expected to result from a combination of organizational changes to reduce management layers  productivity improvements  procurement savings and other operational efficiencies 
we expect to incur restructuring charges of million in connection with these initiatives in fiscal we do not include restructuring charges in the measurement of the performance of our operating segments 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated operating income decreased primarily due to the market deterioration that began in the first quarter of fiscal caused mainly by the escalation in the european sovereign debt crisis  which  together with slowing economic growth  resulted in weakening global demand and periods of volatile prices with an overall downward trend in export selling prices for recycled metals 
this  combined with the constrained supply of raw materials and the adverse effect of average inventory costing on cost of goods sold during periods of sharp declines in selling prices that occurred in fiscal  led to a compression in operating margins which contrasted with the prior fiscal year  which benefited from a stronger market environment and rising prices for recycled metals 
included in consolidated operating income for fiscal was selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million  which approximated the prior fiscal year levels 
included in sg a expense was a decrease in incentive compensation expenses of million resulting from lower financial performance  offset by higher costs primarily associated with incremental operating expenses related to fiscal acquisitions of million and the absence in fiscal year of million of favorable customer contract settlements recorded in fiscal in addition  consolidated operating income in fiscal included restructuring charges of million  consisting of severance  contract termination and other exit costs 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to decreased average borrowings and lower average interest rates under our bank credit facilities compared to the prior year period 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased average borrowings primarily related to our acquisitions in fiscal and higher average interest rates under our bank credit facilities compared to the prior year

fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of compared to an expense of for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the recognition of an expense of million to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets mainly related to a foreign subsidiary  the impact of the non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge and the impact of the foreign tax rate differential on operating losses recorded by our foreign subsidiaries 
the deferred tax assets at the foreign subsidiary for which a valuation allowance was recorded were related primarily to deductible temporary differences created in fiscal by the impairment charge of goodwill and by net operating losses at the subsidiary 
realization of the foreign subsidiary s deferred tax assets is dependent upon us generating a consistent trend of profitability to objectively forecast sufficient taxable income in the foreign tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from utilization of net operating losses 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  as of august  fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to state tax benefits and research and development credits  partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign subsidiaries results taxed at different tax rates 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate benefited from certain adjustments recorded in the period  including a recognition of research and development credits  a reduction in a reserve for unrecognized state income tax benefits and the correction of a prior period error that resulted in an increase to net income of million

credit facilities following is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long term debt in thousands outstanding as of remaining availability unsecured  uncommitted credit line bank unsecured revolving credit facility tax exempt economic development revenue bonds due january n a remaining availability is net of million of outstanding stand by letters of credit 
our credit facility  which provides for revolving loans of million and c million  matures in april pursuant to an unsecured committed bank credit agreement with bank of america  na as administrative agent  and other lenders party thereto 
interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the agreement are based  at our option  on either the london interbank offered rate or the canadian equivalent plus a spread of between and  with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio  or the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus or the british bankers association libor rate plus 
in addition  annual commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facility at rates between and based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio 
we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility of million and million as of august  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under this facility was and as of august  and  respectively 
we also have an unsecured  uncommitted million credit line with wells fargo bank  na that expires on march  interest rates are set by the bank at the time of borrowing 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility as of august  and no borrowings outstanding as of august  the two bank credit agreements contain various representations and warranties  events of default and financial and other covenants which could limit or restrict our ability to create liens  raise additional capital  enter into transactions with affiliates  acquire and dispose of businesses  guarantee debt  and consolidate or merge 
the financial covenants include the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
as of august   we were in compliance with these covenants and we expect to remain in compliance in the future 
however  in the event of a sustained deterioration in market conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position  there can be no assurances that we will continue to remain in compliance with the financial covenants 
if we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders a breach of either covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements  the most severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under both agreements 
we use these credit facilities to fund working capital requirements  acquisitions  capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases 
in addition  as of august  and  we had million of long term tax exempt bonds outstanding that mature in january dividends the total dividend paid in fiscal was per common share compared to per common share in fiscal and per common share in fiscal acquisitions in fiscal  we expanded our presence in the regions in which we operate and in new locations through the acquisition of four used auto parts facilities in richmond and surrey  british columbia  near our mrb operations in surrey  british columbia  two used auto parts facilities located in kansas and missouri  two used auto parts facilities located in massachusetts near our mrb operations  and one used auto parts facility located in rhode island near our mrb operations

capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures in fiscal included investments in the construction of a new shredder  advanced processing equipment and related infrastructure for our facility in surrey  british columbia  which began operations in the third quarter of fiscal  and the construction of a new nonferrous processing facility in puerto rico  which commenced operations in september in addition  we made further investments in infrastructure to improve efficiency  increase capacity  improve worker safety  enhance environmental systems and replace equipment 
we currently plan to invest up to million in capital expenditures in fiscal using cash generated from operations and available lines of credit 
environmental compliance our commitment to sustainable recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner requires us to continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate 
as part of our capital expenditures  we invested million  million and million for environmental projects in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to invest up to million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal these projects include investments in storm water systems and equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations 
we have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa as one of the potentially responsible parties prps that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the portland harbor superfund site the site 
a group of prps is conducting an investigation and study to identify and characterize the contamination at the site and develop alternative approaches to remediation of the contamination 
on march  the group submitted to the epa a draft feasibility study draft fs based on approximately ten years of work and million in costs classified as investigation related 
the draft fs identifies ten possible remedial alternatives which range in estimated cost from approximately million to million net present value for the least costly alternative to approximately billion to billion net present value for the most costly and estimates a range of two to years to implement the remedial work  depending on the selected alternative 
the draft fs does not determine who is responsible for remediation costs  define the precise cleanup boundaries or select remedies 
the draft fs is being reviewed and is likely to be subject to revisions  which could be significant  prior to its approval by the epa 
while the draft fs is an important step in the epa s development of a proposed plan for addressing the site  a final decision on the nature and extent of the required remediation will occur only after the epa has prepared a proposed plan for public review and issued a record of decision rod 
currently available information indicates that the epa does not expect to issue its final rod selecting a remedy for the site until at least responsibility for implementing and funding the epa s selected remedy will be determined in a separate allocation process  which is currently underway 
because there has not been a determination of the total cost of the investigations  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps  we believe it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which are reasonably possible to incur in connection with the site  although such costs could be material to our financial position  results of operations  future cash flows and liquidity 
any material liabilities recorded in the future related to the site could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements 
significant cash outflows in the future related to the site could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases

share repurchase program pursuant to a share repurchase program  as amended  we have existing authorization to repurchase up to million shares of our class a common stock  out of a million share repurchase program  when we deem such repurchases to be appropriate 
we evaluate long and short range forecasts as well as anticipated sources and uses of cash before determining the course of action in our share repurchase program 
prior to fiscal  we had repurchased approximately million shares under the program 
we did not repurchase any of our class a common stock in fiscal redeemable noncontrolling interest in march  we issued common stock of one of our subsidiaries to a noncontrolling interest holder of that subsidiary that is redeemable both at the option of the holder and upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control 
on march  we purchased all of the outstanding noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary for million 
the noncontrolling interest was adjusted to its fair market value at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  the difference between the adjusted carrying schnitzer steel industries  inc form k

assessment of liquidity and capital resources historically  our available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs 
we generally believe our current cash resources  internally generated funds  existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short term and long term liquidity needs for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  share repurchases  dividends  joint ventures  debt service requirements and environmental obligations 
however  in the event of a sustained market deterioration  we may need additional liquidity  which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or  if obtained  would be adequate or on acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations and commitments we have certain contractual obligations to make future payments 
the following table summarizes these future obligations as of august  in thousands payment due by period thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital leases  including interest operating leases purchase obligations other total long term debt represents the principal amounts of all outstanding long term debt  maturities of which extend to interest payments on long term debt are based on interest rates in effect as of august  as the contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding are variable  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement  including purchases of inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
other contractual obligations consist of pension funding obligations and other accrued liabilities 
we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations  including workers compensation and performance bonds 
at august   we had million outstanding under these arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
our critical accounting estimates include those related to goodwill  environmental costs  inventories  accounting for business combinations and revenue recognition

goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the second fiscal quarter and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
we have determined that our reporting units for which goodwill has been allocated are equivalent to our operating segments  as all of the components of each segment meet the criteria for aggregation 
when testing goodwill for impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not  we are then required to perform the two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
in the first step of the quantitative impairment test  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital wacc determined separately for each reporting unit 
to estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model  we employ a terminal value technique  whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures and adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model  then discount it by the wacc to establish the terminal value 
the determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
critical assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future commodity prices and volume expectations  operating margins  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  tax rates  terminal growth rates  discount rates and synergistic benefits available to market participants 
we performed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal  proceeding directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
for the apb reporting unit  the calculated fair value using the income approach substantially exceeded its carrying value  while for the mrb reporting unit the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
we also used a market approach based on earnings multiple data and a reconciliation of our market capitalization to our estimate of the aggregate fair value of our reporting units  including consideration of a control premium  to corroborate our reporting units valuations 
as a result of our annual impairment test  goodwill allocated to our reporting units was deemed not to be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified the combination of the continued challenging market conditions  the constrained supply of raw materials  the company s recent financial performance and the lack of recovery of our market capitalization as a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill allocated to our reporting units 
for the apb reporting unit  the calculated fair value using the income approach substantially exceeded its carrying value 
for the mrb reporting unit with goodwill of million as of july   the first step of the impairment test showed that the reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying amount  indicating a potential impairment 
the projections used in the income approach for mrb took into consideration the continued weak market conditions and the cyclical nature of our industry 
the projections assumed a gradual recovery of operating margins and volumes over a multi year period 
the market based wacc used in the income approach for mrb was  compared to used in mrb s annual impairment test performed in the second quarter of fiscal the higher wacc was the result of an increase in the risk free market interest rate and the inclusion of an additional company risk premium of to reflect increased uncertainty in connection with the extent and pace of improvements in market conditions and future company performance 
the terminal year growth rate used in the discounted cash flow model was 
based on the second step of the impairment test  we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill for the mrb reporting unit was less than its carrying amount  resulting in an impairment of goodwill of million 
we also used a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units valuations in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reconciled our market capitalization to our estimate of the aggregate fair value of our reporting units  including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest 
the implied control premium resulting from the difference between our market capitalization based on the average trading price of our class a common stock for the two week period ended july  and the higher aggregated estimated fair value of our reporting units was within the historical range of average and mean premiums observed on historical transactions within the steel making and scrap processing industries

as a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue growth rates  pace and extent of operating margin and volume recovery  market based wacc and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of the reporting units fair value 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units goodwill for impairment are reasonable  it is possible that market and economic conditions could deteriorate further or not improve as expected 
additional declines in or a lack of recovery in market conditions from current levels  a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance including the pace and extent of operating margin and volume recovery  a further decline in our share price from current levels  or an increase in the market based wacc  among other factors  could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in further goodwill impairment charges that  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
environmental costs we operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of our sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation 
our accrued environmental liabilities as of august  included million related to third party investigation costs for the portland harbor superfund site 
because there has not been a determination of the total cost of the investigations  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps  we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which it is likely or reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with the site  although such costs could be material to our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
therefore  no additional amounts have been accrued 
see contingencies environmental in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
inventories our inventories primarily consist of scrap metal ferrous  nonferrous  processed and unprocessed  nonferrous recovered joint product  used and salvaged vehicles  semi finished steel products billets and finished steel products primarily rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value for our inventory 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand 
the accounting process we use to record metal quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  we rely on weighed quantities that are reduced by estimated amounts that are moved into production 
these estimates utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of our schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents schnitzer steel industries  inc 
inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  we adjust the ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
business combinations in a business combination  we recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  generally using a market based income approach 
measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
we utilize management estimates that incorporate input from an independent third party valuation firm in our determination of these fair values 
such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance and determining the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metal and finished steel products transfers based on contract terms 
a significant portion of our ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
all sales made on open account are evaluated for collectibility prior to revenue recognition 
additionally  when detailed documents support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss we recognize revenues on partially loaded shipments  which requires an estimate of the product weight involved in any partial shipments at period end 
for apb  retail revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts  and wholesale product revenues are recognized when customer weight certificates are received following shipment 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized 
we present taxes assessed by governmental authorities collected from customers on a net basis 
therefore  the taxes are excluded from revenue and are shown as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets until remitted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for finished steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metals  including scrap metal  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
we respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations 
we assess the net realizable value of inventory nrv each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimated future selling prices 
based on contracted sales and estimates of future selling prices  a decrease in the selling price per ton of finished steel products would have caused an nrv inventory write down of million at smb as of august  a decrease in the selling price of inventory would not have caused a material nrv impact at mrb or apb as of august  interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations 
our credit line and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations  or to provide sufficient quantities of scrap metal or payment to settle advances  loans and other contractual receivables in connection with demolition and scrap extraction projects 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods  including shipping ferrous scrap metal exports under letters of credit  collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers  establishment of credit limits for sales on open terms and designation of collateral and financial guarantees securing advances  loans and other contractual receivables 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks it deems creditworthy 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of significantly declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  we may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  we could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails 
as of august  and  and  respectively  of our trade accounts receivable balance was covered by letters of credit 
of the remaining balance as of august   was less than days past due  compared to as of august  schnitzer steel industries  inc form k
