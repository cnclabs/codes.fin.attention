item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc the company succeeded to the business and operations of the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  we operate a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
on june   we acquired the banking operations of mirae bank from the fdic  which had been named receiver of the institution 
we acquired approximately million in assets and assumed million in liabilities 
this included million in loans  and million in deposits in addition to five branch offices 
the integration of former mirae was successfully completed in the third quarter of  during which out of the branches were merged as a result of their close proximity to our existing office locations 
even with the branch mergers  the retention rate for former mirae deposit customers remained high 
in and  we experienced significant losses due primarily to an increase in provision for loans losses and loan commitments that resulted from deterioration in the loan portfolio 
management was successful in reversing this trend in and returning the company to its most profitable year in history 
during  we experienced significant improvement in overall credit quality of our loan portfolio 
over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty four branch offices and eight lpos 
we expanded our network of lpos and established two new offices in newark  california  and bellevue  washington in in we started construction on a branch office in palisades park  new jersey which will expand our presence in our east coast market 
the palisades park branch is expected to be open during the first half of we believe that our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue implementing our growth strategy using strategic planning and market analysis  as our needs and resources permit 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans net of deferred fees and including loans held for sale  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business geographically by focusing on the continued development of the east coast market 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our operations during our total assets increased to billion at the end of  an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits decreased to billion at the end of  or a decrease of from billion at the end of 
table of contents our total loans increased to billion at the end of  an increase of from billion at the end of total net interest income before credit for loan losses decreased to million in  or a decline of  from million in we had a negative provision for loss on loans and loan commitments totaling million in  compared to a provision for losses on loans and loan commitments of million in total noninterest income increased to million in  an increase of from million in total noninterest expense increased to million or in  compared to million in the increase is mainly due to the impairment charge of million taken on the fdic loss share indemnification asset during net income available for common shareholders for increased to million  or per basic and diluted common share  compared with a net loss available to common shareholders of million  or per basic and diluted common share in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the negative provision for losses on loans and loan commitments in in addition to the deferred tax asset valuation reversal during the year 
compared to  provision for losses on loans and loan commitments declined million to a negative provision for losses on loans and loan commitments of million in in addition  the deferred tax assets valuation allowance recorded in was reversed during significantly reducing our total tax expense 
the decrease in provisions for losses on loans and loan commitments was a result of significant improvements in credit quality of the loan portfolio 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  and has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions  and other subjective assessments 
we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates  and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for losses on loans  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of retained interests and servicing assets related to the sales of sba loans  valuation of held for sale loans  valuation of oreo  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment and intangible assets  evaluation of fdic loss share indemnification impairment  and the accounting for income tax provisions 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we believe that we have used the best information available to make the necessary estimates to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in key variables could change future valuations and could have an impact on our net income 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates 
table of contents may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under asc  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in notes and of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented later in this report 
under asc  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the company currently utilizes an independent third party bond accounting service for our investment portfolio accounting 
the third party provides fair values derived from a proprietary matrix pricing model which utilizes several different sources for pricing 
the fair values for our investment securities are updated on a monthly basis 
the values received are tested annually and are validated using prices received from another independent third party source 
we also perform an analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we ensure whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
impairments related to credit issued must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process involving assessment of valuation and changes in such valuations resulting from deteriorating credit worthiness 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent  and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as 
table of contents of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note and in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements presented later in this report 
as required under financial accounting standards board fasb asc  we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities 
we consider factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  and the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored enterprises gse bonds  residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obligations cdos that had previously been rated aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the fair value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
there were no unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities at december  small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion in accordance with asc transfers and servicing 
we allocate the book value of the related loans among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following the amount received from the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip  or i o strip  receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset was amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral 
table of contents types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
any subsequent increase or decrease in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair values  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
allowance for loan losses based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside an allowance for losses on loans and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments which is established by a periodic provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
these charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components  specific valuation allowance sva or allowance on impaired loans that are individually evaluated  and general valuation allowance gva or loans that are evaluated for losses in pools based on historical experience and qualitative adjustments qa  or estimated losses from factors not captured by historical experience 
historical loss experience used to calculate gva may not entirely capture all expected credit losses and trends 
therefore  management performs a review of the historical loss rates used in gva as well as the factors in our qa methodology on a quarterly basis due to the increased significance of gva when estimating losses in the current economic environment 
to establish an adequate allowance  we must be able to recognize when loans have become a problem 
a risk grade of either pass  watch  special mention  substandard  or doubtful  is assigned to every loan in the loan portfolio  with the exception of homogeneous loans  or loans that are evaluated together in pools of similar loans ie  home mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  overdraft loans  express business loans  and automobile loans 
the following is a brief description of the loan classifications or risk grades used in our allowance calculation pass loans loans that are past due less than days that do not exhibit signs of credit deterioration 
the financial condition of the borrower is sound as well as the status of any collateral 
loans secured by cash principal and interest also fall within this classification 
watch loans performing loans with borrowers that have experienced adverse financial trends  higher debt equity ratio  or weak liquidity positions  but not to the degree that the loan is considered a problem 
special mention loans that are currently protected but exhibit an increasing degree of risk based on weakening credit strength and or repayment sources 
contingent or remedial plans to improve the bank risk exposure should be documented 
substandard loans inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or pledged collateral  if any 
this grade is assigned when inherent credit weakness is apparent 
doubtful loans having all the weakness inherent in a substandard classification but collection or liquidation is highly questionable with the possibility of loss at some future date 

table of contents we currently use migration analysis as a factor in calculating our allowance for loan losses in addition to a software program used to produce historical loss rates for different loan classes used in our gva estimations 
the company also utilizes a qa matrix to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
the qa matrix takes into consideration both internal and external factors  and includes forecasted economic environments unemployment gdp  problem loan trends non accrual  delinquency  and impaired loans  trends in real estate value  and other factors 
although the qa takes into consideration different loan segments and loan classes  the adjustments made are to the loan portfolio as a whole 
for impaired loans  or sva allowance  we evaluate loans on an individual basis to determine impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
all these components are combined for a final allowance for loan losses figure on a quarterly basis 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days or more delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on non accrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
loans held for sale pursuant to asc a long lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria are met  a 
management has authority to approve and commit to selling the asset b 
the asset is immediately available for sale c 
a plan to sell has been completed including actively locating buyers d 
the sale is probable within year and is expected to qualify as a sale e 
the asset is actively being marketed for sale at a reasonably price f 
the plan to sell indicates it is unlikely that significant change to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn 
if the company has the intention to sell a note and if all of the criteria above are met  then the loan is be categorized as held for sale as of the date the decision is made 
once classified as held for sale  the loan is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value 
provisions and reserves are recorded to reflect a decline in fair value if the fair value is less than the loan carrying amount 
any subsequence decline or increase in fair value for held for sale loans are accounted for as an increase or decrease in valuation allowance for held for sale loans which directly affects earnings 
when loans are classified as held for sale  the discount or premium is not amortized  but interest and expenses related to the note continue to be accrued 
loans transferred to held for sale continue to be recorded the same past due and non accrual treatment as other loans  if necessary 
a valuation allowance may be recorded on loans categorized as held for sale and not sold in subsequent quarters if the fair value of the loan or underlying property declines based on quoted prices or appraisals 
once a loan has been sold  the difference between the purchase price and the fair value is measured against net income as a gain or loss on sale of loans 

table of contents valuation of other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the estimated fair value less the selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york in  and intangible assets from the fdic assisted acquisition of mirae bank in as of december  goodwill stood unchanged from the previous year at million  all of which is related to the liberty bank acquisition located in the east coast 
million and million  respectively  in core deposits intangibles were recorded as a result of the liberty bank and mirae bank acquisition 
unamortized core deposit intangibles at december  totaled  and  related to the liberty and mirae bank transaction  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed 
we recognized goodwill of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york in  currently comprised of our four east coast branches 
goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing the east coast branches estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure for actual impairment  if any exists 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value amount is determined in a manner similar to the way goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and a new basis is established for goodwill 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill 
under asu  a company is given the choice of assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under asu  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  management assessed the qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the east coast unit was less than its carrying amount 
based on the analysis of these factors  management determined that it was more likely than not that test  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount and therefore conclude that the two step goodwill impairment test did not need to be performed 
the company will continue to monitor the performance of the east coast branches and perform an analysis for goodwill impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently  as needed 
fdic indemnification asset with the acquisition of mirae bank  the bank entered into a loss sharing agreement with the fdic for amounts receivable under the agreement 
the company accounted for the receivable balances under the loss sharing agreement as an fdic indemnification asset in accordance with asc business combinations 
the fdic indemnification asset was accounted for on the date of the acquisition at fair value by adding the present value of all the cash flows that the company expected to collect from the fdic based on expected losses to be incurred on the covered loan portfolio based on the terms of the loss sharing agreement 
as expected and actual cash flows increase and decrease from what was estimated at the time of acquisition  the fdic indemnification and the impact to the allowance for loan losses will decrease and increase  respectively 
when covered loans are paid off  the fdic indemnification asset is offset with interest income and the corresponding allowance for loan losses is reversed 
covered loans that become impaired with losses in excess of initially estimated  results in an increase in the allowance for loan losses and an increase in the indemnification asset by the insured amount 
in  we recorded an impairment of million on the fdic loss share indemnification asset as expected cashflows had increased from cashflows estimated at acquisition 
no impairment charges were recorded on the indemnification asset prior to the remaining balance of the fdic loss share indemnification  net of impairment  was million at december  income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test results in no tax benefit being recorded 
the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  in and recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  in as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was million  which is comprised of the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions and anticipated adjustments from currently on going irs examination 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
our average net loans gross loans including held for sale  less allowance for loan losses and deferred fees and costs were billion in  compared with billion in  and billion in  representing a decrease of in  and a decrease of in from each of the prior annual periods 
the decrease in loans in was due to higher pay downs and pay offs in than origination 
average interest earning assets were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in  representing a decrease of in and a decrease of in from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits decreased  to billion in  and decreased by  to billion in  compared with billion in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities decreased to billion in  and decreased by to billion in  compared to billion in our yields on interest earnings assets were in  in  and in average yield on interest earning assets increased basis points to during largely due to improvements in credit quality which reduced the amount of non accrual interest reversals 
in  average yield on interest earning assets was reduced to  or basis points  from the previous year as a result of the decline in loan yields 
in  loans were originated at rates that were lower than the average weighted rate of the existing loan portfolio 
this contributed to the reduction in loan yields  and ultimately yields on interest earning assets 
total interest income declined in to million and declined in to million  down from million in the decrease from to was again related to new loans being originated at lower rates 
interest expense meanwhile has continued to decline  decreasing to million in and to million in  compared with million in the decline in interest expense for and was attributable to a steady reduction in deposit rates  a the reduction in higher costing time deposits  and a reduction in in the cost of other borrowings throughout these periods 

table of contents although interest expense has continued to decline from to  net interest income before credit or provision for loan losses and loan commitments declined from million in  to million in  and million in this represents a net interest income decline of in  and a decline in  compared to the previous years figures 
as a result of our lowered cost of funds in  our net interest spread increased from in  to in  but declined to in as a result of the basis point decline in yield on average earning assets 
the net interest margin improved from in  to in  but declined in to

such charges were made not only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
through the enhancement of our loan underwriting standards  proactive credit follow up procedures  and aggressive disposal of problem loans through charge offs and note sales  we experienced a substantial improvement in our overall credit quality of our loans in and again in our provision for losses on loan and loan commitments declined million which resulted in an overall credit for loan losses and loan commitments of million in  and a decrease of to million in provision for loan losses in  from million provision for loan losses in the improvement in credit quality coupled with a reduction in overall loan charge offs resulted in continued reductions in credit costs from to the sales of problems loans contributed to the reduction of non performing and potential non performing loans in and total non performing loans were reduced to manageable levels in  thereby reducing problem note sales during the year 

table of contents in  problem loans with a carrying balance of approximately million were sold to help resolve and reduce our problem loans and potential problem loans 
the problem loans sold in were all secured by real estates and million were on non accrual status  while million were classified as tdr loans at the time of the sale 
the loans that were sold in were sold at an average weighted discount to principal balance of

analysis fees charges increased as total demand deposit accounts have increased year over year from to we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive edge in our markets 
net gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of our total noninterest income in was our next largest source of noninterest income 
net gain on sale of loans declined from million in to million in  but then increased to million in the decrease in net gain sale of loans in compared to was largely due the losses recorded from the sale of problem cre loans 
with the improvements in credit quality experienced in and  the number of problems loans sold has significantly declined resulting in a decrease in loss on sale of loans

also included in net gain on sale of loans is the valuation of loans held for sale 
the valuation expense on loans held for sale totaled  for the year ended december   and million in we did not have any valuations on held for sale loans in our third largest source of noninterest income in was loan related servicing fees  which represented approximately of our total noninterest income 
loan related servicing fee income consists of trade financing fees  servicing fees related to mortgage and warehouse loans sold  and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
in  loan related servicing fees increased to million  compared to million in  and million in the servicing fee income on sold loans is credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing rights and interest only strips i o strip that we originally capitalized upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing rights and i o strips are also charged against the loan service fee income account when the sold loans are paid off

with the decrease in the number of employees in  salaries and employee benefits decreased to million  compared with million for however salaries and benefits increased to million in due to the increase in total number of employees and also due to employee bonuses that were paid in in light of the improved financial performance during the year 
assets per employee stood at million for  million for  and million for fdic indemnification impairment was the second largest source of noninterest expense at million  or of total noninterest expense  in in connection with our acquisition of the covered loans from the fdic  as receiver for mirae bank  and the indemnification agreement we entered into with the fdic as part of such acquisition  we recorded an fdic indemnification asset in accordance with asc in essence  the fdic indemnification asset represents the present value of the total amounts that we expected to recover from the fdic on covered loan losses 
the fdic indemnification impairment reflected overall improved credit quality in the covered loan portfolio and reflected the reduction in total expected loss share reimbursement from the fdic under the loss sharing agreement 
the balance of the fdic indemnification asset after impairment charges at december  was million 
we had no fdic indemnification impairment expenses in years prior to although we experienced an impairment expense of million in  because the impairment reflects an improvement in covered loan credit quality  the expensed amount is partially offset by increased interest income from and lower credit costs 

table of contents occupancy and equipment expenses represent approximately of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in  million in  and million in occupancy and equipment expenses remained fairly consistent from to  declining  in  and increasing  in the reopening of our lpo offices in did not have a significant impact on the occupancy and equipment expense in professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in   and  respectively 
professional fees increased million in largely due to a million increase in accounting and auditing fees 
legal fees also increased in as a result of credit quality issues and costs related to the class action lawsuit

therefore the increase in losses on lihtc investments is linked to the financial performance of the investment projects 
data processing expenses totaled million which represented of total noninterest expense in this compares to data processing expenses of million in and million in although we experienced a slight decline in data processing expense in  these expenses have not fluctuated significantly since the changes to data process expense have largely been a result of changes to the total number of accounts and number of transactions during the year 
regulatory assessment fee expenses represent fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  this expense decreased to million  or of total noninterest expense  from million in  and million in regulatory assessment fees decreased million in compared to largely due to the bank improved regulatory risk rating 
the decrease in was due to the change in the method of calculating the fdic premium assessment as a result of the dodd frank act 
advertising and promotional expenses increased to million in after having decreased to million in  from million in advertising and promotional expenses represented of total noninterest expense for these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers  especially in relatively new areas such as the east coast market in new york and new jersey 
the increase in was largely due to an increase in advertising expenses and promotional expenses related to the increase focus on loan marketing and production 
outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks for their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the fees and charges on the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us

there was a net loss on the sale of oreo for of million compared to million in these oreo related expenses declined in as a result of the overall improvement in credit quality and reduction in oreo and oreo sales 
all other noninterest expenses  made up of post retirement benefit costs  office supplies  loan fees  director fees  oreo expense  and other expenses decreased by million  to million  or of total noninterest expense in from million in  and million in the decline in other noninterest expense in was mostly attributable to a decline in expense related to oreo  which decreased million in compared to 
table of contents provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we had an income tax benefit of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  compared with tax expense of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for  and tax benefits of million on pretax net loss of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate decreased significantly in compared to  due primarily to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense is recorded as deferred tax assets liabilities change from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the future realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization is dependent upon the generating of sufficient future taxable income during the periods temporary differences become deductible 
as of december  the company has no valuation allowance and had net deferred tax asset of million 
at december  the company had valuation allowance of million and no valuation allowance at december  as of december  and  the company had net deferred tax assets of and million  respectively 
the company recorded a valuation allowance during the first quarter of against its entire net deferred tax asset  primarily due to accumulated taxable losses and the absence of clear and objective positive where that future taxable income would be sufficient enough to realize the tax benefits of its deferred tax assets 
during the third quarter of  management performed a critical evaluation of all positive and negative evidence supporting a reversal of the valuation allowance 
positive evidence included  but not limited to  quarters three years of cumulative positive pre tax income  seven continuous quarters of positive earnings  strengthening capital  significantly improved asset quality  and removal of regulatory orders 
negative evidence included uncertainty in recovery or slow growth of us economy  increased regulatory scrutiny that can adversely affect future earnings  and further impairment of fdic indemnification assets 
based on the evaluation  management concluded that aforementioned available positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence and those deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized  thus maintaining a valuation allowance was no longer required 
management reversed the million deferred tax valuation allowance during the year in accordance with asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and  in related interest in as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was million  which is comprised of the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions and anticipated adjustments from currently on going irs examination 
we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
as of december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes

in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we performed detailed evaluations of the investment portfolio to assess individual investment positions that have fair values that have declined below cost 
in assessing whether there was other than temporary impairment  we consider the following whether or not all contractual cash flows due on a security will be collected  and our positive intent and ability to hold the debt security until recovery in fair value or maturity a number of factors are considered in the analysis  including but not limited to issuer credit rating  likelihood of the issuer default or bankruptcy  collateral underlying the security

for held for sale loans that we choose to sell in the secondary market  we sell them with representations and warranties generally consistent with industry practices  but without recourse 
the exception was with sba loans  and it was our practice to resell these loans in the secondary market for the guaranteed portion with day recourse 
however  beginning march  the recourse provision for sba guaranteed portions sold was removed and no longer a standard for these transactions 
accordingly  we do not retain a significant amount of the credit risk exposure on the loans sold

however  with the high concentration of real estate secured loans  we plan to focus more on commercial lending in the short term 
consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in personal lines of credits

restructured loans are loans of which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal 
other npas consist of properties  mainly other real estate owned  or oreo  acquired by foreclosure or by similar means that management intends to offer for sale

allowance for loan losses and loan commitments based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside an allowance for losses on loans and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments which is established by a period provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
these charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a 
table of contents component of other liabilities 
the provision for losses on loans and loan commitments is discussed in the previous section entitled provision for loan losses and loan commitments 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components  a specific valuation allowance sva or the allowance on impaired loans that are individually evaluated  and a general valuation allowance gva or loans that are evaluated for losses in pools based on historical experience and qualitative adjustments qa  or estimated losses from factors not captured by historical experience 
historical loss experience used to calculate gva may not entirely capture all expected credit losses and trends 
therefore  management performs a review of the historical loss rates used in gva as well as the factors in our qa methodology on a quarterly basis due to the increased significance of gva when estimating losses in the current economic environment 
to establish an adequate allowance  we must be able to recognize when loans have become a problem 
a risk grade of either pass  watch  special mention  substandard  or doubtful  is assigned to every loan in the loan portfolio  with the exception of homogeneous loans  or loans that are evaluated together in pools of similar loans ie  home mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  overdraft loans  express business loans  and automobile loans 
the following is a brief description of the loan classifications or risk grades used in our allowance calculation pass loans loans that are past due less than days that do not exhibit signs of credit deterioration 
the financial condition of the borrower is sound as well as the status of any collateral 
loans secured by cash principal and interest also fall within this classification 
watch loans performing loans with borrowers that have experienced adverse financial trends  higher debt equity ratio  or weak liquidity positions  but not to the degree that the loan is considered a problem 
special mention loans that are currently protected but exhibit an increasing degree of risk based on weakening credit strength and or repayment sources 
contingent or remedial plans to improve the bank risk exposure is documented 
substandard loans inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or pledged collateral  if any 
this grade is assigned when inherent credit weakness is apparent 
doubtful loans having all the weakness inherent in a substandard classification but collection or liquidation is highly questionable with the possibility of loss at some future date 
we currently use migration analysis as a factor in calculating our allowance for loan losses in addition to a software program used to produce historical loss rates for different loan classes used in our gva estimations 
the company also utilizes a qa matrix to estimate losses not captured by historical experience 
the qa matrix takes into consideration both internal and external factors  and includes forecasted economic environments unemployment gdp  problem loan trends non accrual  delinquency  and impaired loans  real estate value trends  and other factors 
although the qa takes into consideration different loan segments and loan classes  the adjustments made are to the loan portfolio as a whole 
for impaired loans  or sva allowance  we evaluate loans on an individual basis to determine impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
all these components are combined together for a final allowance for loan losses figure on a quarterly basis 
net charge offs in decreased to million compared to million in total net charge offs in were much higher than in due to note sale transactions in addition to the improvement in credit quality in the net charge offs in were comprised of  in construction loan net recoveries  million in real estate secured net loan charge offs  million commercial and industrial loans net charge offs  and  consumer loan net recoveries 
the million in net charge offs represents of average total loans in  compared with    and in   and  respectively 

table of contents with the improvement in credit quality experienced in  in addition to the reduction in npas  the allowance for loan losses declined by million to million at december  compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
even with the decrease in the allowance for loan losses and loan commitments experienced in  we were able to maintain the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans held for investment at     and at the end of     and  respectively 
the general valuation allowance at december  totaled million  or of the total allowance for loan losses  and specific valuation allowance on impaired loans totaled million  or of the total allowance 
the qualitative adjustment included in the general valuation allowance portion of the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of the gva portion of the allowance for loan losses at december  at december   general valuation allowance portion totaled million  or of total allowance  while the specific reserve on impaired loans totaled million or of the total allowance for loan losses 
qa for the fourth quarter of totaled million  or of the gva portion of the allowance 
the improvements in credit quality during resulted in significant declines in loan losses  and charge offs reducing the historical loss percentages used in our allowance calculation 
higher level net charge off periods are dropping out of our historical horizon utilized in the bank migration analysis and more recent low level net charge off periods are taking their place  also contributing to the lower loss rates in most of the company loan categories 
as a result  the historical loss rates used in our gva calculation  declined by million  or 
the qa portion of the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  in to offset a portion of the large declines in gva 
the potential for further deterioration in our local and global economy continues to exist with uncertainty in europe and possibility of a double dip recession 
in light of these factors  management increased our qa to account for these and other uncertainties that could affect the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
the reserve for unfunded loan commitments at december  totaled million  a decline from million at december  at december   commitments to extend credit totaled million  compared to million at december  although total commitments to extend credit increased by million in  total allowance for loan commitments declined by million during the same period 
the decrease is attributable to a decline in our historical loss rates in addition to a reduction in line utilization rates in  both of which factor into our required allowance calculations for loan commitments 
although management believes our allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables may result in further increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future

principal concessions usually consist of loans restructured to reduce the monthly payment through a reduction in principal  interest  or a combination of principal and interest payments for a certain period of time 
most of these types of concessions are usually interest only payments for three to six months 
term or maturity concessions are loans that are restructured to extend the maturity date beyond the original contractual term of loans 
interest rate concessions consist of tdr loans that are restructured with lower interest rates than original term of the loans and lower than the current market interest rates for loans with similar risk characteristics 
the tables below summarize tdr loans that were modified during the past months that had payment default during the years ended december  and december  we consider a tdr loan to be in payment default if the loan has been transferred to non accrual status 
this usually means the loan is past due days or more  but in certain cases a loan that is less than days past due can be deemed a non accrual loan  if there exists evidence that the borrower will not be able to fulfill a portion or all of the obligated contractual payments

however  at this time  we are unable to estimate the range of additional losses that are reasonably possible because of a number of factors  including the fact that certain of these litigation matters are still in their early stages and involve claims for which  at this point  we believe have little to no merit

as a result of the capital raise in the second quarter of and note sales throughout the year  the company experienced a large inflow of excess liquidity 
in order to limit the net interest margin compression from the current low rate environment and the excess liquidity  management implemented a strategy to reduce high cost deposits  particularly time deposits 
this was achieved through the gradual reduction in deposits rates for these accounts throughout the year 
our primary focus for was to improve our deposit mix and increase overall demand deposits accounts and balances 
this strategy will continue into as well

accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies had until march  to come into compliance with the final rule capital restrictions due to the transition period 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule

maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash outflow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  and issuance of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans and the routine pay downs and liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
in addition  government programs may influence deposit behavior 
primary use of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash outflows from operating activities of million  inflows of million  and net cash outflows of million  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to originations of held for sale loans which increased million to origination of million in compared to an outflow of million in  and outflows were million in proceeds from the sale of 
table of contents held for sale loans totaled million in  million in  and million in december  net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million in compared to net cash inflows of million and million  in and  respectively 
during  investment securities activities purchases  net of proceeds from repayments  maturities  calls  and sold securities resulted in net cash outflows of million compared to net cash outflows of million in  and net cash inflows of million in in  net loans receivable increased million contributing to total cash outflows from investing activities 
cash inflows from the decline in net loans receivable totaled million in and cash outflows from the increase in net loans receivable in totaled million 
net cash outflows from financing activities totaled million in  million in  and million in the net cash used in financing activities in was used to pay for the redemption of the company tarp preferred stock totaling million in addition to the redemption of subordinated debentures of million 
the primary use of funds in and was to fund deposit declines and the redemption of fhlb borrowings 
for the purpose of having liquid cash available for emergencies  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december    and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was   and at december    and  respectively 
the increase in liquid assets in is a result of funds received from the sale of problem loans and proceeds from the capital raise during the second quarter of  while the decline in liquid assets in was largely due the utilization of excess cash used to fund loan originations throughout the year 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we have a combination of available borrowing sources comprised of fhlb advances  the federal reserve bank discount window borrowings  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
among all these sources  we prefer advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our loans  investments  and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution net worth  or on the fhlb assessment of the institution creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we intend to limit our use to of our borrowing capacity as such borrowings do not qualify as core funding sources 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was approximately million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to a combined million in federal funds through lines with three correspondent banks 
borrowing capacity at the frb discount window stood at million at december  there were no outstanding balances at any of our correspondent banks or at the frb discount window at december  it is management belief that our liquidity is sufficient to meet the company short term and long term cash flow needs as they arise 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and levels of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  
table of contents whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt  or hybrid securities  similar to our capital raise 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios as of the dates specified for wilshire bancorp  inc and wilshire state bank actual capital ratios as of december  december  december  regulatory adequately capitalized standards regulatory well capitalized standards capital ratios wilshire bancorp wilshire state bank bancorp bank bancorp bank bancorp bank total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to average assets at december   total shareholders equity was million  an increase of million from shareholders equity of million at december  the increase in equity in was largely due to the increase in net income available to common shareholders totaling million in compared to a loss of million in the record earnings in helped offset the reduction in equity that resulted from the redemption of the tarp preferred stock during the year 
this redemption of tarp preferred stock reduced total equity by million 
at december   total shareholders equity increased by million  after declaring cash dividends of million to preferred shareholders  to million from million at december  the increase in capital in was a result of our second quarter issuance of common stock through our capital raise 
after subtracting fees and costs associated with the capital raise  a total of million in common stock was raised during the second quarter of as of december   we included million in junior subordinated debentures in our regulatory capital ratio computations 
all of these debentures were issued by the company 
at december   we did not include any qualifying subordinated debt in our calculation of tier and total capital

impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us through its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing  and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the company board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  the asset liability management committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation  and monitoring of earnings to provide stable income and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize gap analysis and simulation modeling to determine the 
table of contents sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets in a given time period  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest income stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates earned or paid changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate gaps arise when assets are funded with liabilities that have different repricing intervals 
because these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and economic value of equity eve to interest rate changes 
the eve is defined as the net present value of an institution existing assets less liabilities 
the simulation model captures all assets and liabilities  and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions  and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and eve under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst case scenario 
the asset liability management committee policy prescribes that for the modeled reasonably possible worst rate change scenario  the expected reduction of net interest income and eve should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base eve  respectively 
in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans  and investments  a decrease in interest rates would ultimately result in a decline in our net interest income and in our eve 
an increase in interest rates would increase net interest income and eve  except in the case of basis point increase in the interest rates which would reduce eve 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and eve  could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 

table of contents the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms
