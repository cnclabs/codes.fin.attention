item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview the core competency of the company is flow measurement solutions 
the company is a leading innovator  manufacturer and marketer of flow measurement and control products  serving water and gas utilities  municipalities and industrial customers worldwide 
measuring a wide variety of liquids ranging from water and oil to lubricants in industrial processes  the company products are known for their high degree of accuracy  long lasting durability and ability to provide valuable and timely measurement information to customers 
the company product lines fall into three categories sales of water meters and related technologies to municipal water utilities municipal water  sales of meters to various industries for water and other fluids industrial flow and sales of concrete vibrators and gas meter radios to unique markets specialty products 
the company estimates that over of its products are used in water applications when all categories are grouped together 
municipal water  the largest category by sales volume  includes water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues 
the key market for the company water meter products is north america  primarily the united states  because the meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the american water works association 
sales of water meters and related technologies and services are commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales  the latter referring to larger sizes of meters 
industrial flow includes products sold worldwide to measure and control materials flowing through a pipe or pipeline including water  air  steam  oil  and other liquids and gases 
these meters and valves are used in a variety of applications  such as water wastewater  heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac  oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical  food and beverage  and pharmaceutical production 
specialty products include sales of radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters  and concrete vibrators 
additional information about the company business is described in part  item business under the heading market overview  products  systems and solutions in this annual report on form k 
business trends increasingly  the electric utility industry relies on ami technology for two way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer site 
although the company does not sell products for electric market applications  the trend toward ami affects the markets in which the company does participate  particularly for those customers in the water utility market that are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection 
specifically  ami and ama technologies enable water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals 
the company sells its technology solutions to meet customer requirements 
since the technology products have comparable margins  any change in the mix between amr  ami or ama is not expected to have a significant impact on the company net sales related to meter reading technology 
there are approximately  water utilities in the united states and the company estimates that less than percent of them have converted to a radio solutions technology 
although there is growing interest in ami and ama communication by water utilities  the vast majority of utilities installing such technology continue to select amr technologies for their applications 
the company orion technology has experienced rapid acceptance in the united states as an increasing number of water utilities have selected orion as their amr solution 
the company anticipates that even with growing interest in ami and ama  amr will continue to be the primary product of choice for a number of years 
for many water utilities  amr technology is simply the most cost effective solution available today 
however  with the introduction of ama  the company believes it is well positioned to meet customers future needs 
acquisitions on january   the company completed its acquisition of of the outstanding common stock of racine federated  inc racine federated of racine  wisconsin and its subsidiary premier control technologies  ltd 
pct located in thetford  england for approximately million in cash  plus a working capital adjustment of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold pct for a nominal amount after the majority of its functions were absorbed by the company european subsidiary 
the company also merged racine federated into badger meter  inc on december  racine federated manufactures and markets flow meters for the water industry as well as various industrial metering and specialty products 
these products complement and expand the company existing lines for the global flow measurement business 
this acquisition is further described in note acquisitions in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
on january   the company purchased remag  ag remag of bern  switzerland for million 
remag distributes a line of precision flow measurement products  some of which they manufacture  for the global industrial market 
their small turbine meters complement and expand the company existing line of industrial flow products 
this acquisition is further described in note acquisitions in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
on april   the company purchased cox instruments  llc cox of scottsdale  arizona  and its subsidiary flow dynamics  inc for million 
cox instruments and flow dynamics manufacture and market precision high performance flow meters that are used in demanding applications such as aerospace  custody transfer and flow measurement test stands 
the company merged the two entities into a wholly owned subsidiary named cox flow measurement  inc on april   and merged the subsidiary into badger meter  inc on december  this acquisition is further described in note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
revenue and product mix prior to the company introduction of its own proprietary radio products  for example orion and galaxy  itron water utility related products were a dominant radio products contributor to the company results 
itron products are sold under an agreement between the company and itron  inc that has been renewed multiple times and is in effect until early the company radio products directly compete with itron water radio products 
in recent years  many of the company customers have selected the company proprietary products over itron products 
while the company proprietary product sales are generally greater than those of the itron licensed products  the company expects that itron products will remain a significant component of sales to water utilities 
continuing substantial sales in both product lines underscores the continued acceptance of radio technology by water utilities and affirms the company strategy of selling itron products in addition to its own proprietary products 
as the industry continues to evolve  the company has been vigilant in anticipating and exceeding customer expectations 
in  the company introduced ama as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities  which it believes will help maintain the company position as a market leader 
the company continues to seek opportunities for additional revenue enhancement 
for instance  the company is periodically asked to oversee and perform field installation of its products for certain customers 
the company assumes the role of general contractor  hiring installation subcontractors and supervising their work 
the company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty 
in recent years  the company has sold orion radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
with the exception of a large sale of gas radios to one particular customer  the revenues from such products and services are not yet significant and the company is uncertain of the potential growth achievable for such products and services in future periods 
results of operations net sales net sales in increased million  or  to million from million in the overall increase was due to the inclusion of racine federated net sales for eleven months of the year and higher municipal water sales  offset somewhat by lower sales of radios to natural gas utilities 
racine federated sales for the eleven months ended december  were million 
municipal water sales increased million  or  to million in from million in these sales represented of total net sales in compared to in the sales increase was due to higher sales of residential meters sold with technology as well as higher commercial meter sales 
sales of meters with technology increased for the year due to higher volumes of product sold 
sales of manually read residential meters were essentially flat between years 
commercial water meter sales increased in compared to due to higher volumes of product sold 
the company believes the net overall increase for the year was due to normal buying patterns beginning to resume after a period where there were and still are negative factors affecting market conditions 
these factors include lingering concerns about municipal spending  which have resulted in delayed buying decisions  and slower housing starts 
in addition  the company introduction in of the next generation of the orion product lengthened the sales cycle for water utilities as they evaluate this new technology 
weather may have also played a role as poor weather in the midwest and northeast had a negative impact on sales in early due to its effects on budget demands and installation rates  which did not recur in early industrial flow products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased million  or  to million from million in as previously noted  racine federated was acquired on january  and racine federated sales were included from that point forward 
within this product grouping  racine federated sales were million 
the remainder of the increase was due to higher sales in most of the remaining industrial flow product lines 
specialty products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales decreased million in  or  to million from million in included in this product grouping was million of sales from racine federated 
without these sales  specialty products would have shown a larger sales decrease due to lower sales of radios into the natural gas market 
the sales included higher sales of radios to one particular natural gas customer that did not recur in international sales for municipal water meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in canada and mexico  which use similar mechanical technology and standards as customers in the us international sales for industrial flow and specialty products are generally made throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros 
other international sales are made in us dollars or local currencies 
international sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the addition of racine federated product lines 
net sales in decreased million  or  to million from million in the overall decrease was the net result of lower volumes sold for the company municipal water products  offset somewhat by higher sales of industrial flow and specialty products 
higher prices in certain product lines also helped offset the lower municipal water product sales 
municipal water sales represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales decreased in by million  or  to million from million 
the decline was due primarily to lower volumes of the company residential technology products  as well as lower sales of commercial and manually read residential meters  offset by somewhat higher prices in certain product lines 
the company believes the net decrease in municipal water sales was due to a continuation of certain factors  including concerns over municipal spending that continue to delay order decisions  slower housing starts and the company introduction in early of the next generation of the orion product that caused water utilities to take time to evaluate this new technology 
in addition  poor weather in the midwest and northeast had a negative impact on sales in early due to its effects on budget demands and installation rates 
industrial flow products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was due in part to the addition of million of sales from the acquisition of remag  which was not included in the results 
most of the other industrial flow product line sales increased in over specialty products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased million in  or  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to a larger sale of gas radios to one particular natural gas customer in international sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher industrial flow product sales of valves and electromagnetic meters in europe as the global economy slowly recovers 
gross margins gross margins as a percentage of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in was due in part to the addition of racine federated products  whose margins are generally a higher percentage than the company overall weighted margin percentage 
margins also increased due to lower costs for castings which fluctuate with the metals market  and higher sales volumes in general which increase overall factory utilization 
offsetting these factors was the impact of lower sales of radios to natural gas utilities 
gross margins were lower in compared to due to significantly higher commodity costs  particularly copper  mitigated somewhat by higher prices charged for the company products as well as cost reductions as the company began to transition additional operations to its mexican facilities 
this transition was completed in the second quarter of approximately positions were transferred from the milwaukee facility to the mexican facility as part of a plan to move production to lower cost facilities 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration expenses in increased million  or  over s expenses 
the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of racine federated and amortization of intangibles acquired  which were not included in the results for the remainder of the increase was due to higher employee incentives and normal inflationary increases  offset by continuing cost control measures 
in addition  the amounts include a million charge in connection with the write down of the company investment in an emerging technology company and a million non cash pension charge as a result of payouts from the pension plan occurring faster than the assumed rate 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due in part to the inclusion of remag expenses which were not included in the amounts and expenses for the acquisition of cox  which were included in results for only nine months of other reasons for the increase include higher amortization of various intangibles and software as well as higher costs associated with the technical support of the company products 
in addition  expenses for include approximately million of charges associated with the acquisition of racine federated that was acquired on january  as well as a non cash pension curtailment charge as a result of contract negotiations with the company only union in which the union agreed to freeze its defined benefit plan at december  and participate in the company defined contribution plan 
the amounts include a one time credit of million for the fair value of land received in settlement of claims against a building contractor 
operating earnings operating earnings in increased million  or  to million compared to million in  as a net result of the higher sales of municipal water and industrial flow products  offset somewhat by higher selling  engineering and administration expenses 
in addition  lower costs of certain raw materials also contributed to the increased operating earnings 
operating earnings in decreased million  or  to million compared to million in the decrease was due to lower sales as a result of lower volumes of product sold  as well as increased selling  engineering and administration expenses 
interest expense  net interest expense  net was million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to higher borrowings in associated with the acquisition of racine federated and the company stock repurchase program 
interest expense  net was million in compared to million in the decrease was due primarily to lower borrowings in income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were   and for  and  respectively 
the results include recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for certain deductions that were taken on prior tax returns 
these benefits total approximately million and were recognized in earnings in due to the realization that such benefits became more likely than not upon the conclusion of an irs audit of the company federal income tax return 
without these benefits  the provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for would have been 
the increase in from was due to less foreign income  which was taxed at lower rates 
the decrease in the effective tax rate between and was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits discussed above and higher foreign income taxed at lower rates 
earnings and diluted earnings per share as a result of the increased operating earnings  offset somewhat by a higher effective tax rate  net earnings were million in compared to million in on a diluted basis  earnings per share were in compared to in as a result of the lower operating earnings  mitigated somewhat by a lower effective tax rate  net earnings were million in compared to million in on a diluted basis  earnings per share were in compared to in liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operations in compared to was due to significantly higher earnings  offset by higher inventory balances and a pension plan contribution made in receivables at december  were million compared to million in the increase was due in part to the addition of racine federated in and the resulting increase in sales 
the company believes its net receivables balance is fully collectible 
inventories at december  were million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of racine federated in with the remainder due to the timing of purchases 
property  plant and equipment increased as a net result of capital expenditures and the acquisition of racine federated property  plant and equipment  offset by depreciation expense 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
the company believes it has adequate capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures 
intangible assets increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the acquisition of racine federated and the resulting valuation of its intangible assets  partially offset by amortization expense 
also  as a result of that acquisition  goodwill increased to million at december  compared to million at december  short term debt increased from december  to december  as the company borrowed funds for its acquisition of racine federated and for its stock repurchase program 
cash generated from operations was used to pay down some of this debt in at the end of  debt represented approximately of the company total capitalization 
the company is in compliance with the financial covenants associated with the debt 
none of the debt is secured by the company assets 
payables increased at december  to million compared to million at december  the amount includes million owed to the sellers of racine federated that is to be paid july  the remainder of the increase was due to the timing of purchases 
accrued compensation and employee benefits increased million between years primarily due to higher employee incentives 
warranty and other after sale costs decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the amount included a reserve for a specific known issue that was resolved in other accrued employee benefits decreased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to payouts of certain deferred compensation amounts 
deferred income taxes current assets and long term liabilities switched from a net asset of million to a net liability of million primarily due to the purchase of racine federated and the inclusion of its resulting temporary differences 
the overall reduction in total shareholders equity from million at december  to million at december  was the result of net earnings and stock options exercised  offset by dividends paid and million of common stock repurchased and retired by the company under a stock repurchase program 
the company financial condition remains strong 
in may  the company signed a new credit agreement which increased its principal line of credit from million to million with its primary lender for a three year period 
the line will be permanently reduced by million annually beginning in while the facility is unsecured  there are a number of financial covenants with which the company is in compliance 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and the development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market 
the company had million of unused credit lines available at december  off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  contractual obligations in  the company restructured the outstanding debt of its employee savings and stock option plan the essop by loaning the essop million to repay a loan to a third party and loaning the essop an additional million to purchase additional shares of the company common stock for future k savings plan matches under a program that will expire on december  under this program  the company agreed to pay the principal and interest on the new loan amount of million 
the receivable from the essop and the related obligation were therefore netted to zero on the company consolidated balance sheets at december  and the terms of the loan call for equal payments of principal with the final payment due on december  at december   million of the loan balance remains 
the following table includes the company significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period total less than year years years beyond in thousands short term debt operating leases total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  the company is not required to make a minimum contribution for its pension plan for the calendar year 
postretirement medical claims are paid by the company as they are submitted  and they are anticipated to be million in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company more significant estimates relate primarily to the following judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the healthcare reserve for claims incurred  but not reported 
each of these reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most likely amount based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these methods have been used for all years in the presented financials and have been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates if actual experiences vary from the company assumptions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts vary by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility  while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios 
the calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends 
the healthcare reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in the company also uses estimates in four other significant areas i pension and other postretirement obligations and costs  ii stock based compensation  iii income taxes  and iv evaluating goodwill at least annually for impairment 
the actuarial valuations of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key assumptions including discount rates and long term expected returns on plan assets 
the company discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plans 
the assumptions for expected long term rates of return on assets for its pension plan are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns  taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations  investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals 
on december   the company froze its pension plan for its non union participants and formed a new defined contribution feature within the essop plan in which each employee received a similar benefit 
on december   the company froze its pension plan for its union participants and included them in the same defined contribution feature within the essop 
the total cost of the company stock based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted  adjusted for forfeitures 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures  which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the reserve for uncertainty in income taxes is a matter of judgment based on an evaluation of the individual facts and circumstances of each tax position in light of all available evidence  including historic data and current trends 
a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits of each tax position 
the company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions quarterly 
goodwill impairment  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and is reviewed at least annually 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
other matters the company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations 
the company is named as one of many potentially responsible parties in two landfill lawsuits 
the landfill sites are impacted by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and other environmental laws and regulations 
at this time  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based on the company assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of and government focus on other named third parties with these landfill sites 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters 
a future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the company  off site disposal locations used by the company  and property owned by third parties that is near such sites  could result in future costs to the company and such amounts could be material 
expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during  and were not material 
like other companies in recent years  the company is named as a defendant in numerous pending multi claimant multi defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos  manufactured by third parties  and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the company products 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has proven or substantially demonstrated asbestos exposure caused by products manufactured or sold by the company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed 
the company has been named as a defendant in one pending patent infringement lawsuit 
the lawsuit alleges the company and other parties infringed a patent on a metering data feature 
the company believes this claim is without merit and it is vigorously defending its interests 
as part of its contracts  the company indemnifies certain customers and alliance partners for intellectual property infringement claims on its products 
some of those types of parties are also named defendants in this lawsuit 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of this issue will have a material adverse effect on the company financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k and part i  item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact the company financial performance and results of operations 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and radio systems for water utilities 
a number of the company competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products  particularly those that provide radio solutions 
in addition  the market level of acceptance of the company newer products  such as the recently introduced ama systems  may have a significant effect on the company results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  including to some extent such things as the length and severity of global economic downturns  the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs  the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of the company products  the company ability to obtain financing  housing starts in the united states  and overall industrial activity 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company operations 
the company relies on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  the loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company products include purchased castings made of metal or alloys such as brass  which uses copper as its main component  aluminum  stainless steel and cast iron  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the company does not hold significant amounts of precious metals 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company forecasted usage 
the company foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers and purchases of material from foreign vendors 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company foreign currency net monetary assets were partially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company believes the effect of a change in foreign currency rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
future annual interest costs for short term debt will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately million
