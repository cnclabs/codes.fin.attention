and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis business environment global economic conditions generally weakened in  as real gross domestic product gdp growth slowed in most major economies 
market sentiment was affected by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties  although positive developments helped to improve market conditions 
these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions 
in addition  the us economy posted stable to improving economic data  including favorable developments in unemployment and housing 
these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads  higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility 
however  concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty  particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff  generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis critical accounting policies fair value fair value hierarchy 
financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value ie  inventory  as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities  are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value ie  marked to market  with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the hierarchy under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap gives i the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities level inputs  ii the next priority to inputs other than level inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly level inputs  and iii the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity level inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement 
the fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels and of the fair value hierarchy 
certain level and level financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and the firm s credit quality  funding risk  transfer restrictions  liquidity and bid offer spreads 
valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence 
instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable 
as of december and december  level assets represented and  respectively  of the firm s total assets 
absent evidence to the contrary  instruments classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price  which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value 
subsequent to the transaction date  we use other methodologies to determine fair value  which vary based on the type of instrument 
estimating the fair value of level financial instruments requires judgments to be made 
these judgments include determining the appropriate valuation methodology and or model for each type of level financial instrument  determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data  including prices evidenced by market transactions  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities and correlations  and determining appropriate valuation adjustments related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality 
regardless of the methodology  valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence 
controls over valuation of financial instruments 
market makers and investment professionals in our revenue producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments 
our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market clearing levels 
in the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment eg  calibration to market comparables or trade comparison  as described below  the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in control and support functions that are independent of the revenue producing units independent control and support functions 
this independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis price verification 
all financial instruments at fair value in levels  and of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process 
the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review 
instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
price verification strategies utilized by our independent control and support functions include trade comparison 
analysis of trade data both internal and external where available is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations 
external price comparison 
valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties eg  broker or dealers  markit  bloomberg  idc  trace 
data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity 
when broker or dealer quotations or third party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification  greater priority is generally given to executable quotations 
calibration to market comparables 
market based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics  risks and components 
relative value analyses 
market based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity  measured in terms of risk  liquidity and return  of one instrument relative to another or  for a given instrument  of one maturity relative to another 
collateral analyses 
margin disputes on derivatives are examined and investigated to determine the impact  if any  on our valuations 
execution of trades 
where appropriate  trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market clearing levels 
backtesting 
valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales 
see notes through to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about fair value measurements 
review of net revenues 
independent control and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures  including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors 
through this process we independently validate net revenues  identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified 
review of valuation models 
the firm s independent model validation group  consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers  performs an independent model approval process 
this process incorporates a review of a diverse set of model and trade parameters across a broad range of values including extreme and or improbable conditions in order to critically evaluate the model s suitability for valuation and risk management of a particular instrument type  the model s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks  the suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model  the model s consistency with models for similar products  and the model s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions 
new or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use 
models are evaluated and re approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill is assessed annually for impairment  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist  by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive  a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value 
estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments 
critical inputs to the fair value estimates include i projected earnings  ii estimated long term growth rates and iii cost of equity 
the net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders equity and represents the estimated amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under guidelines issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee in december our market capitalization was below book value during accordingly  we performed a quantitative impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units in which we hold substantially all of our goodwill significantly exceeded the estimated carrying values 
we believe that it is appropriate to consider market capitalization  among other factors  as an indicator of fair value over a reasonable period of time 
if the more recent improvement in market conditions does not continue  and we return to a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment or financial markets  our goodwill could be impaired in the future 
in addition  significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test eg  cost of equity could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline  which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about our goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets i over their estimated lives  ii based on economic usage or iii in proportion to estimated gross profits or premium revenues 
identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for the carrying value and estimated remaining lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class and impairments of our identifiable intangible assets 
a prolonged period of market weakness could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i decreases in revenues from commodity related customer contracts and relationships  ii decreases in cash receipts from television broadcast royalties  iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or iv adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business 
management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred  and to test intangibles for impairment if required

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements  and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in accounting for income taxes  we estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under fasb accounting standards codification see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel

versus net revenues in investment banking were billion for  higher than net revenues in financial advisory were billion  essentially unchanged compared with net revenues in our underwriting business were billion  higher than  due to strong net revenues in debt underwriting 
net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher compared with  primarily reflecting higher net revenues from investment grade and leveraged finance activity 
net revenues in equity underwriting were lower compared with  primarily reflecting a decline in industry wide initial public offerings 
during  investment banking operated in an environment generally characterized by continued concerns about the outlook for the global economy and political uncertainty 
these concerns weighed on investment banking activity  as completed mergers and acquisitions activity declined compared with  and equity and equity related underwriting activity remained low  particularly in initial public offerings 
however  industry wide debt underwriting activity improved compared with  as credit spreads tightened and interest rates remained low 
if macroeconomic concerns continue and result in lower levels of client activity  net revenues in investment banking would likely be negatively impacted 
our investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of the increase compared with the end of was due to an increase in potential debt underwriting transactions  primarily reflecting an increase in leveraged finance transactions  and an increase in potential advisory transactions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in potential equity underwriting transactions compared with the end of  reflecting uncertainty in market conditions 
our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not 
we believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which  over the long term  impact our net revenues 
however  the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment  as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave within the same reporting period 
in addition  our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations  such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future 
transactions may be cancelled or modified  and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur

regulatory developments the us dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  enacted in july  significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate 
the implications of the dodd frank act for our businesses will depend to a large extent on the rules that will be adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the sec  the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and other agencies to implement the legislation  as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by the legislation and the implementing rules 
other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by other regulators and policy makers worldwide and these reforms may affect our businesses 
we expect that the principal areas of impact from regulatory reform for us will be the dodd frank prohibition on proprietary trading and the limitation on the sponsorship of  and investment in  hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities  including bank holding companies  referred to as the volcker rule  increased regulation of and restrictions on over the counter otc derivatives markets and transactions  and increased regulatory capital requirements 
in october  the proposed rules to implement the volcker rule were issued and included an extensive request for comments on the proposal 
the proposed rules are highly complex  and many aspects of the volcker rule remain unclear 
the full impact of the rule on us will depend upon the detailed scope of the prohibitions  permitted activities  exceptions and exclusions  and will not be known with certainty until the rules are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the final rules 
currently  companies are expected to be required to be in compliance by july subject to possible extensions

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis while many aspects of the volcker rule remain unclear  we evaluated the prohibition on proprietary trading and determined that businesses that engage in bright line proprietary trading are most likely to be prohibited

the firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services from hedge funds and private equity funds  which are included in our investment management segment 
the firm also makes investments in funds  and the gains and losses from these investments are included in our investing lending segment  these gains and losses will be impacted by the volcker rule 
the volcker rule limitation on investments in hedge funds and private equity funds requires the firm to reduce its investment in each hedge fund and private equity fund to or less of the fund s net asset value  and to reduce the firm s aggregate investment in all such funds to or less of the firm s tier capital 
the firm s aggregate net revenues from its investments in hedge funds and private equity funds were not material to the firm s aggregate total net revenues over the period from through we continue to manage our existing private equity funds  taking into account the transition periods under the volcker rule 
with respect to our hedge funds  we currently plan to comply with the volcker rule by redeeming certain of our interests in the funds 
since march  we have been redeeming up to approximately of certain hedge funds total redeemable units per quarter  and expect to continue to do so through june we redeemed approximately billion of these interests in hedge funds during the year ended december in addition  we have limited the firm s initial investment to for certain new investments in hedge funds and private equity funds 
as required by the dodd frank act  the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a rule requiring each bank holding company with over billion in assets and each designated systemically important financial institution to provide to regulators an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure resolution plan 
our resolution plan must  among other things  demonstrate that goldman sachs bank usa gs bank usa is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities 
the regulators joint rule sets specific standards for the resolution plans  including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of the company s material entities  organizational structure  interconnections and interdependencies  and management information systems  among other elements 
we submitted our resolution plan to the regulators on june  gs bank usa also submitted its resolution plan on june   as required by the fdic 
in september  the sec proposed rules to implement the dodd frank act s prohibition against securitization participants engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with an investor in a securitization transaction 
the proposed rules would except bona fide market making activities and risk mitigating hedging activities in connection with securitization activities from the general prohibition 
we will also be affected by rules to be adopted by federal agencies pursuant to the dodd frank act that require any person who organizes or initiates an asset backed security transaction to retain a portion generally  at least five percent of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party 
in december  the federal reserve board proposed regulations designed to strengthen the regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial institutions 
these proposals address  among other things  risk based capital and leverage requirements  liquidity requirements  overall risk management requirements  single counterparty limits and early remediation requirements that are designed to address financial weakness at an early stage 
although many of the proposals mirror initiatives to which bank holding companies are already subject  their full impact on the firm will not be known with certainty until the rules are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the final rules 
in addition  in october  the federal reserve board issued final rules for stress testing requirements for certain bank holding companies  including the firm

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management one of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet 
while our asset base changes due to client activity  market fluctuations and business opportunities  the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect i our overall risk tolerance  ii our ability to access stable funding sources and iii the amount of equity capital we hold 
although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day to day basis  our total assets and adjusted assets at quarterly and year end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods 
in order to ensure appropriate risk management  we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include quarterly planning  business specific limits  monitoring of key metrics  and scenario analyses 
quarterly planning 
we prepare a quarterly balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources and capital levels for the upcoming quarter 
the objectives of this quarterly planning process are to develop our near term balance sheet projections  taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels  to ensure that our projected assets are supported by an adequate amount and tenor of funding and that our projected capital and liquidity metrics are within management guidelines and regulatory requirements  and to allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of the firm s overall balance sheet constraints 
these constraints include the firm s liability profile and equity capital levels  maturities and plans for new debt and equity issuances  share repurchases  deposit trends and secured funding transactions 
to prepare our quarterly balance sheet plan  business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions meet with business managers to review current and prior period metrics and discuss expectations for the upcoming quarter 
the specific metrics reviewed include asset and liability size and composition  aged inventory  limit utilization  risk and performance measures  and capital usage 
our consolidated quarterly plan  including our balance sheet plans by business  funding and capital projections  and projected capital and liquidity metrics  is reviewed by the firmwide finance committee 
see overview and structure of risk management for an overview of our risk management structure

table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis business specific limits 
the firmwide finance committee sets asset and liability limits for each business and aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
these limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis 
the firmwide finance committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in limits on an ad hoc basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions 
monitoring of key metrics 
we monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis  including asset and liability size and composition  aged inventory  limit utilization  risk measures and capital usage 
we allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity as well as market fluctuations 
scenario analyses 
we conduct scenario analyses to determine how we would manage the size and composition of our balance sheet and maintain appropriate funding  liquidity and capital positions in a variety of situations these scenarios cover short term and long term time horizons using various macro economic and firm specific assumptions 
we use these analyses to assist us in developing longer term funding plans  including the level of unsecured debt issuances  the size of our secured funding program and the amount and composition of our equity capital 
we also consider any potential future constraints  such as limits on our ability to grow our asset base in the absence of appropriate funding 
through our internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap  ccar  the stress tests we are required to conduct under the dodd frank act  and our resolution and recovery planning  we further analyze how we would manage our balance sheet and risks through the duration of a severe crisis and we develop plans to access funding  generate liquidity  and or redeploy or issue equity capital  as appropriate 
balance sheet allocation in addition to preparing our consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with us gaap  we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses  which is a non gaap presentation and may not be comparable to similar non gaap presentations used by other companies 
we believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with the firm s assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of the firm s assets 
the table below presents a summary of this balance sheet allocation 
as of december in millions excess liquidity global core excess other cash excess liquidity and cash secured client financing inventory secured financing agreements receivables institutional client services icbc equity excluding icbc debt receivables and other investing lending total inventory and related assets other assets total assets in january  we sold approximately of our ordinary shares of icbc

excess liquidity and cash 
we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in the event of a stressed environment 
see liquidity risk management below for details on the composition and sizing of our excess liquidity pool or global core excess gce 
in addition to our excess liquidity  we maintain other operating cash balances  primarily for use in specific currencies  entities  or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity 
secured client financing 
we provide collateralized financing for client positions  including margin loans secured by client collateral  securities borrowed  and resale agreements primarily collateralized by government obligations 
as a result of client activities  we are required to segregate cash and securities to satisfy regulatory requirements 
our secured client financing arrangements  which are generally short term  are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value  and include daily margin requirements to mitigate counterparty credit risk 
institutional client services 
in institutional client services  we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income  equity  currency and commodity products 
additionally  as part of client market making activities  we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities which we can use to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased 
the receivables in institutional client services primarily relate to securities transactions 
investing lending 
in investing lending  we make investments and originate loans to provide financing to clients 
these investments and loans are typically longer term in nature 
we make investments  directly and indirectly through funds that we manage  in debt securities  loans  public and private equity securities  real estate and other investments

these increases were partially offset by decreases in securities purchased under agreements to resell and federal funds sold of billion  primarily due to firm and client activities 
as of december  total liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition were billion  an increase of billion from december this increase was primarily due to an increase in deposits of billion  primarily due to increases in client activity 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value of billion  primarily due to decreases in derivatives and us government and federal agency obligations 
as of december  our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase  accounted for as collateralized financings  were billion  which was essentially unchanged and higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december  respectively 
as of december  the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the year was primarily due to an increase in firm financing activities 
as of december  our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase  accounted for as collateralized financings  were billion  which was higher and higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december  respectively 
as of december  the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the quarter and year was primarily due to increases in client activity at the end of the year 
the level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods  primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral  such as us government and federal agency  and investment grade sovereign obligations through collateralized financing activities

goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis adjusted leverage ratio 
the adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by total shareholders equity 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital 
the adjusted leverage ratio is a non gaap measure and may not be comparable to similar non gaap measures used by other companies 
our adjusted leverage ratio increased to x as of december from x as of december as our adjusted assets increased 
debt to equity ratio 
the debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity 
funding sources our primary sources of funding are secured financings  unsecured long term and short term borrowings  and deposits 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally 
we raise funding through a number of different products  including collateralized financings  such as repurchase agreements  securities loaned and other secured financings  long term unsecured debt including structured notes through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other debt offerings  savings and demand deposits through deposit sweep programs and time deposits through internal and third party broker dealers  and short term unsecured debt through us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances and other methods 
we generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third party distributors  to a large  diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the americas  europe and asia 
we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies  mutual funds and individuals 
we have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs 
secured funding 
we fund a significant amount of inventory on a secured basis 
secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding  due to our posting of collateral to our lenders 
nonetheless  we continually analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities  taking into account trade tenors  maturity profiles  counterparty concentrations  collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities 
we seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities  diversifying counterparties  raising excess secured funding  and pre funding residual risk through our gce 
we seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed  and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis especially during times of market stress 
substantially all of our secured funding is executed for tenors of one month or greater 
assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities  non investment grade corporate debt securities  equities and convertible debentures and emerging market securities 
assets that are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and see unsecured long term borrowings below for further information about the use of unsecured long term borrowings as a source of funding 
the weighted average maturity of our secured funding  excluding funding collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for inclusion in our gce  exceeded days as of december a majority of our secured funding for securities not eligible for inclusion in the gce is executed through term repurchase agreements and securities lending contracts 
we also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings  such as secured loans and notes

equity capital capital adequacy is of critical importance to us 
our objective is to be conservatively capitalized in terms of the amount and composition of our equity base 
accordingly  we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that serves as a guide to determine the amount and composition of equity capital we maintain 
the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our current and future consolidated regulatory capital requirements  our icaap  ccar and results of stress tests  and may also be influenced by other factors such as rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
in addition  we maintain a capital plan which projects sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments  and a contingency capital plan which provides a framework for analyzing and responding to an actual or perceived capital shortfall 
as part of the federal reserve board s annual ccar  us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or greater are required to submit annual capital plans for review by the federal reserve board 
the purpose of the federal reserve board s review is to ensure that these institutions have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress 
the federal reserve board will evaluate a bank holding company based on whether it has the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and stressed scenarios provided by the federal reserve 
as part of the capital plan review  the federal reserve board evaluates an institution s plan to make capital distributions  such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock  across a range of macro economic and firm specific assumptions 
in addition  the rules adopted by the federal reserve board under the dodd frank act  require us to conduct stress tests on a semi annual basis and publish a summary of certain results  beginning in march the federal reserve board will conduct its own annual stress tests and is expected to publish a summary of certain results in march goldman sachs form k

we submitted our ccar to the federal reserve on january  and expect to publish a summary of our results in march our consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by the federal reserve board  as described below 
our icaap incorporates an internal risk based capital assessment designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities  including market risk  credit risk and operational risk  in a manner that is closely aligned with our risk management practices 
our internal risk based capital assessment is supplemented with the results of stress tests

consolidated regulatory capital the federal reserve board is the primary regulator of group inc  a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of bhc act and a financial holding company under amendments to the bhc act effected by the us gramm leach bliley act of as a bank holding company  we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are computed in accordance with the federal reserve board s risk based capital requirements which are based on the basel capital accord of the basel committee 
these capital requirements are expressed as capital ratios that compare measures of capital to risk weighted assets rwas 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information regarding the firm s rwas 
the firm s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
federal reserve board regulations require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum tier capital ratio of and a minimum total capital ratio of 
the required minimum tier capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be considered a well capitalized bank holding company under the federal reserve board guidelines are and  respectively 
bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels  depending on their particular condition  risk profile and growth plans 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under federal reserve board guidelines or that have implemented the federal reserve board s risk based capital measure for market risk

substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as tier capital for basel purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information about the firm s tier leverage ratio 
the tier common ratio equals tier common capital divided by rwas 
we believe that the tier common ratio is meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and  while not currently a formal regulatory capital ratio  this measure is of increasing importance to regulators 
the tier common ratio is a non gaap measure and may not be comparable to similar non gaap measures used by other companies 
our tier capital ratio increased to as of december from as of december primarily reflecting an increase in common shareholders equity and a reduction in market rwas 
the reduction in market rwas was primarily driven by lower volatilities  a decrease in derivative exposure and capital efficiency initiatives that  while driven by future basel rules  also reduced market rwas as measured under the current rules 
changes to the market risk capital rules of the us federal bank regulatory agencies became effective on january  these changes require the addition of several new model based capital requirements  as well as an increase in capital requirements for securitization positions and are designed to implement the new market risk framework of the basel committee  as well as the prohibition on the use of external credit ratings  as required by the dodd frank act 
this revised market risk framework is a significant part of the regulatory capital changes that will ultimately be included in our basel capital ratios 
the firm s estimated tier common ratio under basel reflecting these revised market risk regulatory capital requirements would have been approximately basis points lower than the firm s reported basel tier common ratio as of december see business regulation in part i  item of this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information about our regulatory capital ratios and the related regulatory requirements  including pending and proposed regulatory changes 
risk weighted assets rwas under the federal reserve board s risk based capital requirements are calculated based on the amount of credit risk and market risk 
rwas for credit risk reflect amounts for on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
credit risk requirements for on balance sheet assets  such as receivables and cash  are generally based on the balance sheet value 
credit risk requirements for securities financing transactions are determined based upon the positive net exposure for each trade  and include the effect of counterparty netting and collateral  as applicable 
for off balance sheet exposures  including commitments and guarantees  a credit equivalent amount is calculated based on the notional amount of each trade 
requirements for otc derivatives are based on a combination of positive net exposure and a percentage of the notional amount of each trade  and include the effect of counterparty netting and collateral  as applicable 
all such assets and exposures are then assigned a risk weight depending on  among other things  whether the counterparty is a sovereign  bank or a qualifying securities firm or other entity or if collateral is held  depending on the nature of the collateral 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis rwas for market risk are comprised of modeled and non modeled risk requirements 
modeled risk requirements are determined by reference to the firm s value at risk var model 
var is the potential loss in value of inventory positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we use a single var model which captures risks including interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
for certain portfolios of debt and equity positions  the modeled rwas also reflect requirements for specific risk  which is the risk of loss on a position that could result from changes in risk factors unique to that position 
regulatory var used for capital requirements will differ from risk management var  due to different time horizons day vs 
day  confidence levels vs 
 as well as other factors 
non modeled risk requirements reflect specific risk for other debt and equity positions 
the standardized measurement method is used to determine non modeled risk by applying supervisory defined risk weighting factors to positions after applicable netting is performed

represents resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions 
principally includes receivables from customers  other assets  cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
under the current regulatory capital framework  there is no explicit requirement for operational risk 
as outlined above  changes to the market risk capital rules that became effective on january   require the addition of several new model based capital requirements  as well as an increase in capital requirements for securitization positions 
internal capital adequacy assessment process we perform an icaap with the objective of ensuring that the firm is appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our business 
as part of our icaap  we perform an internal risk based capital assessment 
this assessment incorporates market risk  credit risk and operational risk 
market risk is calculated by using var calculations supplemented by risk based add ons which include risks related to rare events tail risks 
credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties probability of default  the size of our losses in the event of a default and the maturity of our counterparties contractual obligations to us 
operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures 
backtesting is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks 
we evaluate capital adequacy based on the result of our internal risk based capital assessment  supplemented with the results of stress tests which measure the firm s estimated performance under various market conditions 
our goal is to hold sufficient capital  under our internal risk based capital framework  to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event 
our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into the overall risk management structure  governance and policy framework of the firm 
we attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon our internal risk based capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established

table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity risk management credit ratings for further information about credit ratings of group inc  gs co  gsi and gs bank usa 
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries  including gs bank usa and our broker dealer subsidiaries  are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate 
gs bank usa is subject to minimum capital requirements that are calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank holding companies and computes its capital ratios in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to state member banks  which are based on basel  as implemented by the federal reserve board 
as of december  gs bank usa s tier capital ratio under basel as implemented by the federal reserve board was 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about gs bank usa s regulatory capital ratios under basel  as implemented by the federal reserve board 
effective january   gs bank usa also implemented the revised market risk framework outlined above 
this revised market risk framework is a significant part of the regulatory capital changes that will ultimately be included in gs bank usa s basel capital ratios 
for purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital  gs bank usa has established an icaap which is similar to that used by group inc in addition  the rules adopted by the federal reserve board under the dodd frank act require gs bank usa to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results  beginning in march gs bank usa submitted its annual stress results to the federal reserve on january  and expects to publish a summary of its results in march gs bank usa s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we expect that the capital requirements of several of our subsidiaries are likely to increase in the future due to the various developments arising from the basel committee  the dodd frank act  and other governmental entities and regulators 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries and the potential impact of regulatory reform 
subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines  rating agency requirements for entities with assigned credit ratings or internal policies  including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk 
in certain instances  group inc may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory  tax or other constraints 
as of december and december  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion and billion  respectively  compared with its total shareholders equity of billion and billion  respectively

in connection with this guarantee  group inc also agreed to pledge to gs bank usa certain collateral  including interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non us denominated debt 
contingency capital plan our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency  including  but not limited to  identification of drivers of a capital deficiency  as well as mitigants and potential actions

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit and representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  including securitizations 
the securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages  corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
we also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions  provide secondary market liquidity  make investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  provide investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are generally accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting

these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period 
overview and structure of risk management overview we believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of the firm 
accordingly  we have comprehensive risk management processes through which we monitor  evaluate and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational risk exposures 
our risk management framework is built around three core components governance  processes and people 
governance 
risk management governance starts with our board  which plays an important role in reviewing and approving risk management policies and practices  both directly and through its risk committee  which consists of all of our independent directors 
the board also receives regular briefings on firmwide risks  including market risk  liquidity risk  credit risk and operational risk from our independent control and support functions  including the chief risk officer 
the chief risk officer  as part of the review of the firmwide risk package  regularly advises the risk committee of the board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures 
next  at the most senior levels of the firm  our leaders are experienced risk managers  with a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the risks we take 
our senior managers lead and participate in risk oriented committees  as do the leaders of our independent control and support functions including those in internal audit  compliance  controllers  credit risk management  human capital management  legal  market risk management  operations  operational risk management  tax  technology and treasury 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis the firm s governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions 
we make extensive use of risk related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify  manage and mitigate risks 
we maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision making among the revenue producing units  independent control and support functions  committees and senior management 
while we believe that the first line of defense in managing risk rests with the managers in our revenue producing units  we dedicate extensive resources to independent control and support functions in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties 
we regularly reinforce the firm s strong culture of escalation and accountability across all divisions and functions 
processes 
we maintain various processes and procedures that are critical components of our risk management 
first and foremost is our daily discipline of marking substantially all of the firm s inventory to current market levels 
goldman sachs carries its inventory at fair value  with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues 
we do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our financial exposures 
we also apply a rigorous framework of limits to control risk across multiple transactions  products  businesses and markets 
this includes setting credit and market risk limits at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis 
limits are typically set at levels that will be periodically exceeded  rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite 
this fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue producing units  independent control and support functions  committees and senior management  as well as rapid escalation of risk related matters 
see market risk management and credit risk management for further information on our risk limits 
active management of our positions is another important process 
proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress 
we also focus on the rigor and effectiveness of the firm s risk systems 
the goal of our risk management technology is to get the right information to the right people at the right time  which requires systems that are comprehensive  reliable and timely 
we devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete  accurate and timely information 
people 
even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking 
ultimately  effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly 
in both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions  the experience of our professionals  and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure  guide the firm in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels 
structure ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of the firm s board 
the board oversees risk both directly and through its risk committee 
within the firm  a series of committees with specific risk management mandates have oversight or decision making responsibilities for risk management activities 
committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions 
we have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place 
our primary risk committees  most of which also have additional sub committees or working groups  are described below 
in addition to these committees  we have other risk oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses  activities  products  regions and legal entities 
membership of the firm s risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members 
accordingly  the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members within the firm 
in addition  independent control and support functions  which report to the chief financial officer  the general counsel and the chief administrative officer  or in the case of internal audit  to the audit committee of the board  are responsible for day to day oversight or monitoring of risk  as discussed in greater detail in the following sections 
internal audit  which includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience  including risk management expertise  is responsible for independently assessing and validating key controls within the risk management framework

conflicts management conflicts of interest and the firm s approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships  our reputation and our long term success 
the term conflict of interest does not have a universally accepted meaning  and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses 
the responsibility for identifying potential conflicts  as well as complying with the firm s policies and procedures  is shared by the entire firm 
we have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk 
the firm s senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution 
the firm s senior management  the business selection and conflicts resolution group  the legal department and compliance division  the firmwide client and business standards committee and other internal committees all play roles in the formulation of policies  standards and principles and assist in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts

at the transaction level  various people and groups have roles 
as a general matter  the business selection and conflicts resolution group reviews all financing and advisory assignments in investment banking and investing  lending and other activities of the firm

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis liquidity risk management liquidity is of critical importance to financial institutions 
most of the recent failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity 
accordingly  the firm has in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues  even under adverse circumstances 
we manage liquidity risk according to the following principles excess liquidity 
we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment 
asset liability management 
we assess anticipated holding periods for our assets and their expected liquidity in a stressed environment 
we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets  products and counterparties  and seek to maintain liabilities of appropriate tenor relative to our asset base 
contingency funding plan 
we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress 
this framework sets forth the plan of action to fund normal business activity in emergency and stress situations 
these principles are discussed in more detail below 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities and cash 
we believe that the securities held in our global core excess would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days  through liquidation  by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of reverse repurchase agreements  and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
as of december and december  the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits included in our gce totaled billion and billion  respectively 
based on the results of our internal liquidity risk model  discussed below  as well as our consideration of other factors including  but not limited to  a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm  we believe our liquidity position as of december was appropriate 
the table below presents the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our gce 
average for the year ended december in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total the us dollar denominated excess is composed of i unencumbered us government and federal agency obligations including highly liquid us federal agency mortgage backed obligations  all of which are eligible as collateral in federal reserve open market operations and ii certain overnight us dollar cash deposits 
the us dollar denominated excess is composed of only unencumbered german  french  japanese and united kingdom government obligations and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies 
we strictly limit our excess liquidity to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
we do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity  such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities  in our gce 
goldman sachs form k

average for the year ended december in millions overnight cash deposits us government obligations us federal agency obligations  including highly liquid us federal agency mortgage backed obligations german  french  japanese and united kingdom government obligations total the gce is held at group inc and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries  as presented in the table below 
average for the year ended december in millions group inc major broker dealer subsidiaries major bank subsidiaries total our gce reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
our businesses are diverse  and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms eg  interest rates  collateral provisions and tenor or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs 
we believe that our gce provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
in order to determine the appropriate size of our gce  we use an internal liquidity model  referred to as the modeled liquidity outflow  which captures and quantifies the firm s liquidity risks 
we also consider other factors including  but not limited to  an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs and a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm 
we distribute our gce across entities  asset types  and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets  even in a difficult funding environment 
we maintain our gce to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries 
the modeled liquidity outflow incorporates a consolidated requirement as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries 
liquidity held directly in each of these subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc unless i legally provided for and ii there are no additional regulatory  tax or other restrictions 
we hold a portion of our gce directly at group inc to support consolidated requirements not accounted for in the major subsidiaries 
in addition to the gce  we maintain operating cash balances in several of our other operating entities  primarily for use in specific currencies  entities  or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity 
in addition to our gce  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments  including other government obligations  high grade money market securities  corporate obligations  marginable equities  loans and cash deposits not included in our gce 
the fair value of these assets averaged billion and billion for the years ended december and december  respectively 
we do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our gce liquidity pool and therefore conservatively do not assume we will generate liquidity from these assets in our modeled liquidity outflow 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis modeled liquidity outflow 
our modeled liquidity outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a market wide stress and a firm specific stress  characterized by the following qualitative elements severely challenged market environments  including low consumer and corporate confidence  financial and political instability  adverse changes in market values  including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads 
a firm specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses  reputational damage  litigation  executive departure  and or a ratings downgrade 
the following are the critical modeling parameters of the modeled liquidity outflow liquidity needs over a day scenario 
a two notch downgrade of the firm s long term senior unsecured credit ratings 
a combination of contractual outflows  such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt  and contingent outflows eg  actions though not contractually required  we may deem necessary in a crisis 
we assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis 
no issuance of equity or unsecured debt 
no support from government funding facilities 
although we have access to various central bank funding programs  we do not assume reliance on them as a source of funding in a liquidity crisis

asset liability management our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing  even when funding markets experience persistent stress 
we seek to maintain a long dated and diversified funding profile  taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets 
our approach to asset liability management includes conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book  with a focus on maintaining long term  diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements 
see balance sheet and funding sources funding sources for additional details 
actively managing and monitoring our asset base  with particular focus on the liquidity  holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis 
this enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors 
see balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management for more detail on our balance sheet management process and funding sources secured funding for more detail on asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis 
raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets 
this reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets 
because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet  the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates 
our goal is to ensure that the firm maintains sufficient liquidity to fund its assets and meet its contractual and contingent obligations in normal times as well as during periods of market stress 
through our dynamic balance sheet management process see balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management  we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements 
funding plans are reviewed and approved by the firmwide finance committee on a quarterly basis 
in addition  senior managers in our independent control and support functions regularly analyze  and the firmwide finance committee reviews  our consolidated total capital position unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity so that we maintain a level of long term funding that is sufficient to meet our long term financing requirements 
in a liquidity crisis  we would first use our gce in order to avoid reliance on asset sales other than our gce 
however  we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis subsidiary funding policies 
the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc which lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing  liquidity and capital requirements 
in addition  group inc provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products  including secured funding  unsecured borrowings and deposits 
our intercompany funding policies assume that  unless legally provided for  a subsidiary s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on its obligations 
accordingly  we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available until the maturity of such financing 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries 
for example  as of december  group inc had billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in gsi  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in gsec  a uk registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd  a regulated japanese broker dealer  and billion invested in gs bank usa  a regulated new york state chartered bank 
group inc also provided  directly or indirectly  billion of unsubordinated loans and billion of collateral to these entities  substantially all of which was to gs co  gsi and gs bank usa  as of december in addition  as of december  group inc had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
contingency funding plan the goldman sachs contingency funding plan sets out the plan of action we would use to fund business activity in crisis situations and periods of market stress 
the contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors  key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of  and managing through  a liquidity crisis and or market dislocation 
the contingency funding plan also describes in detail the firm s potential responses if our assessments indicate that the firm has entered a liquidity crisis  which include pre funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity 
mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution 
the contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination  control and distribution of information  all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress 
the contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals  which include making and disseminating key decisions  coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress  implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication 
proposed liquidity framework the basel committee on banking supervision s international framework for liquidity risk measurement  standards and monitoring calls for imposition of a liquidity coverage ratio  designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets based on expected cash outflows under an acute liquidity stress scenario  and a net stable funding ratio  designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one year time horizon 
while the principles behind the new framework are broadly consistent with our current liquidity management framework  it is possible that the implementation of these standards could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices 
under the basel committee framework  the liquidity coverage ratio would be introduced on january   however there would be a phase in period whereby firms would have a minimum in which would be raised per year until it reaches in the net stable funding ratio is not expected to be introduced as a requirement until january  goldman sachs form k

credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets  such as otc derivatives  and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance  and the external operating environment  including the assumed level of government support 
certain of the firm s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings 
we assess the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies 
a downgrade by any one rating agency  depending on the agency s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade  may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies 
we allocate a portion of our gce to ensure we would be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two notch reduction in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
the table below presents the additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a one notch and two notch downgrade in our credit ratings 
as of december in millions additional collateral or termination payments for a one notch downgrade additional collateral or termination payments for a two notch downgrade cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets 
consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis market risk management overview market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory due to changes in market prices 
we hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities 
our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities 
our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis  with the related gains and losses included in market making  and other principal transactions 
categories of market risk include the following interest rate risk results from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of yield curves  the volatilities of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  baskets of equities and equity indices 
currency rate risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
market risk management process we manage our market risk by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
this includes accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple risk metrics  a dynamic limit setting framework  and constant communication among revenue producing units  risk managers and senior management 
market risk management  which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firm s chief risk officer  has primary responsibility for assessing  monitoring and managing market risk at the firm 
we monitor and control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent control and support functions across the firm s global businesses 
managers in revenue producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of their positions  markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
managers in revenue producing units and market risk management discuss market information  positions and estimated risk and loss scenarios on an ongoing basis 
risk measures market risk management produces risk measures and monitors them against market risk limits set by our firm s risk committees 
these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at trading desk  business and firmwide levels 
we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short term and long term time horizons 
risk measures used for shorter term periods include var and sensitivity metrics 
for longer term horizons  our primary risk measures are stress tests 
our risk reports detail key risks  drivers and changes for each desk and business  and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions 
systems we have made a significant investment in technology to monitor market risk including an independent calculation of var and stress measures  risk measures calculated at individual position levels  attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each position  the ability to report many different views of the risk measures eg  by desk  business  product type or legal entity  and the ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis value at risk var is the potential loss in value of inventory positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we typically employ a one day time horizon with a confidence level 
we use a single var model which captures risks including interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
as such  var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics 
var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level 
we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process 
inherent limitations to var include var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme 
var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions 
previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves 
when calculating var  we use historical simulations with full valuation of approximately  market factors 
var is calculated at a position level based on simultaneously shocking the relevant market risk factors for that position 
we sample from years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation 
the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time 
this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities  which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss 
as a result  even if our inventory positions were unchanged  our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
our var measure does not include positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures  and the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives  as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
model review and validation our var model is subject to review and validation by our independent model validation group at least annually 
this review includes a critical evaluation of the model  its theoretical soundness and adequacy for intended use  verification of the testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the model functions as intended  and verification of the suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model 
our var model is regularly reviewed and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the composition of inventory positions  as well as variations in market conditions 
prior to implementing significant changes to our assumptions and or model  we perform model validation and test runs 
significant changes to our var model are reviewed with the firm s chief risk officer and chief financial officer  and approved by the firmwide risk committee 
we evaluate the accuracy of our var model through daily backtesting ie  comparing daily trading net revenues to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries 
stress testing we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of significant risk exposures across the firm 
we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on the firm s portfolios  including sensitivity analysis  scenario analysis and firmwide stress tests 
the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes 
sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions eg  equity prices or credit spreads using a variety of defined market shocks  ranging from those that could be expected over a one day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur 
we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of a single corporate entity  which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures 
goldman sachs form k 
table of contents the goldman sachs group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event  including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously 
for example  for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign inventory as well as the corresponding debt  equity and currency exposures associated with our non sovereign inventory that may be impacted by the sovereign distress 
when conducting scenario analysis  we typically consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario  ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts 
in addition  these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward looking hypothetical scenarios 
firmwide stress testing combines market  credit  operational and liquidity risks into a single combined scenario 
firmwide stress tests are primarily used to assess capital adequacy as part of the icaap process  however  we also ensure that firmwide stress testing is integrated into our risk governance framework 
this includes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for the icaap process 
see equity capital internal capital adequacy assessment process above for further information about our icaap process 
unlike var measures  which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level  there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur 
instead  stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors 
when estimating potential loss  we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so 
stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of the firm s routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns 
stress testing is an important part of the firm s risk management process because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks  highlight potential loss concentrations  undertake risk reward analysis  and assess and mitigate our risk positions 
limits we use risk limits at various levels in the firm including firmwide  product and business to govern risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk 
limits are set based on var and on a range of stress tests relevant to the firm s exposures 
limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions  business conditions or tolerance for risk 
the firmwide risk committee sets market risk limits at firmwide and product levels and our securities division risk committee sets sub limits for market making and investing activities at a business level 
the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling the firm s overall risk profile 
sub limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day to day basis without additional levels of senior management approval  effectively leaving day to day trading decisions to individual desk managers and traders 
accordingly  sub limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance 
sub limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand  taking into account the relative performance of each area 
our market risk limits are monitored daily by market risk management  which is responsible for identifying and escalating  on a timely basis  instances where limits have been exceeded 
the business level limits that are set by the securities division risk committee are subject to the same scrutiny and limit escalation policy as the firmwide limits 
when a risk limit has been exceeded eg  due to changes in market conditions  such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations  it is reported to the appropriate risk committee and a discussion takes place with the relevant desk managers  after which either the risk position is reduced or the risk limit is temporarily or permanently increased

these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the diversification benefit across risk categories 
our average daily var decreased to million in from million in  primarily reflecting decreases in the equity prices and currency rates categories  principally due to reduced exposures 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the diversification benefit across risk categories 
year end var and high and low var in millions risk categories as of december year ended december high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total our daily var decreased to million as of december from million as of december  primarily reflecting decreases in the interest rates and equity prices categories due to lower levels of volatility

during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was not exceeded and was reduced on one occasion due to lower levels of volatility 
during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was exceeded on one occasion 
it was resolved by a temporary increase in the firmwide var risk limit  which was subsequently made permanent due to higher levels of volatility 
the firmwide var risk limit had previously been reduced on one occasion in  reflecting lower risk utilization and the market environment

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis credit risk management overview credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty eg  an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold 
our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments 
credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks  securities financing transactions ie  resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities and receivables from brokers  dealers  clearing organizations  customers and counterparties 
credit risk management  which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firm s chief risk officer  has primary responsibility for assessing  monitoring and managing credit risk at the firm 
the credit policy committee and the firmwide risk committee establish and review credit policies and parameters 
in addition  we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk eg  bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans 
these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures  which are monitored and managed by market risk management  consistent with other inventory positions 
policies authorized by the firmwide risk committee and the credit policy committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for the firm to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas  taking into account any applicable netting provisions  collateral or other credit risk mitigants 
credit risk management process effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely information  a high level of communication and knowledge of customers  countries  industries and products 
our process for managing credit risk includes approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits  monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits  assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations  measuring the firm s current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default  reporting of credit exposures to senior management  the board and regulators  use of credit risk mitigants  including collateral and hedging  and communication and collaboration with other independent control and support functions such as operations  legal and compliance 
as part of the risk assessment process  credit risk management performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties 
a credit review is an independent judgment about the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations 
for substantially all of our credit exposures  the core of our process is an annual counterparty review 
a counterparty review is a written analysis of a counterparty s business profile and financial strength resulting in an internal credit rating which represents the probability of default on financial obligations to the firm 
the determination of internal credit ratings incorporates assumptions with respect to the counterparty s future business performance  the nature and outlook for the counterparty s industry  and the economic environment 
senior personnel within credit risk management  with expertise in specific industries  inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings 
our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries economic groups 
these systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product  internal credit rating  industry  country and region

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis risk measures and limits we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in an event of non payment by a counterparty 
for derivatives and securities financing transactions  the primary measure is potential exposure  which is our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level 
potential exposure takes into account netting and collateral arrangements 
for loans and lending commitments  the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position 
we also monitor credit risk in terms of current exposure  which is the amount presently owed to the firm after taking into account applicable netting and collateral 
we use credit limits at various levels counterparty  economic group  industry  country to control the size of our credit exposures 
limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties 
limits for industries and countries are based on the firm s risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring  review  escalation and management of credit risk concentrations 
stress tests scenario analysis we use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures  including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors eg  currency rates  interest rates  equity prices 
these shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements 
some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors  consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event 
in the case of sovereign default  we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures  changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default  and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default 
unlike potential exposure  which is calculated within a specified confidence level  with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring 
we run stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments 
stress tests are regularly conducted jointly with the firm s market and liquidity risk functions 
risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions  we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and or to terminate transactions if the counterparty s credit rating falls below a specified level 
for loans and lending commitments  depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction  we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants 
risk mitigants include collateral provisions  guarantees  covenants  structural seniority of the bank loan claims and  for certain lending commitments  provisions in the legal documentation that allow the firm to adjust loan amounts  pricing  structure and other terms as market conditions change 
the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan 
when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent company  we may obtain third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations 
we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements

cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents include both interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits 
to mitigate the risk of credit loss  we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks 
otc derivatives 
derivatives are reported on a net by counterparty basis ie  the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
derivatives are accounted for at fair value  net of cash collateral received or posted under credit support agreements 
as credit risk is an essential component of fair value  the firm includes a credit valuation adjustment cva in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
cva is a function of the present value of expected exposure  the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default 
the tables below present the distribution of our exposure to otc derivatives by tenor  based on expected duration for mortgage related credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual maturity for other derivatives  both before and after the effect of collateral and netting agreements 
receivable and payable balances for the same counterparty across tenor categories are netted under enforceable netting agreements  and cash collateral received is netted under credit support agreements 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same tenor category are netted within such tenor category 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents

we manage the firm s traditional credit origination activities  including funded loans and lending commitments both fair value and held for investment loans and lending commitments  using the credit risk process  measures and limits described above 
other lending positions  including secondary trading positions  are risk managed as a component of market risk 
other credit exposures 
the firm is exposed to credit risk from its receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties 
receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are primarily comprised of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded  but not yet settled 
these receivables have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short term nature of receivables related to securities settlements 
receivables from customers and counterparties are generally comprised of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short term nature of these receivables 
credit exposures as of december  our credit exposures increased as compared with december  reflecting an increase in cash and loans and lending commitments  partially offset by a decrease in otc derivative exposures 
the percentage of our credit exposure arising from non investment grade counterparties based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents increased from december reflecting an increase in loans and lending commitments 
counterparty defaults rose slightly during the year ended december  however  the estimated losses associated with these counterparty defaults were lower as compared with the prior year

market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our inventory due to changes in market prices 
there is no overlap between the credit and market exposures in the tables below

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis we conduct stress tests intended to estimate the direct and indirect impact that might result from a variety of possible events involving the above countries  including sovereign defaults and the exit of one or more countries from the euro area 
in the stress tests  described in market risk management stress testing and credit risk management stress tests scenario analysis  we estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including  but not limited to  currency rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test 
we also estimate the indirect impact on our exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the event  such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above 
we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude  highlight potential loss concentrations  and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary 
euro area exit scenarios include analysis of the impacts on exposure that might result from the redenomination of assets in the exiting country or countries 
constructing stress tests for these scenarios requires many assumptions about how exposures might be directly impacted and how resulting secondary market moves would indirectly impact such exposures 
given the multiple parameters involved in such scenarios  losses from such events are inherently difficult to quantify and may materially differ from our estimates 
in order to prepare for any market disruption that might result from a euro area exit  we test our operational and risk management readiness and capability to respond to a redenomination event

operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors as well as extraordinary incidents  such as major systems failures 
potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include clients  products and business practices  execution  delivery and process management  business disruption and system failures  employment practices and workplace safety  damage to physical assets  internal fraud  and external fraud 
the firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well controlled environment to minimize operational risks 
the firmwide operational risk committee  along with the support of regional or entity specific working groups or committees  provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies and framework 
our operational risk management department operational risk management is a risk management function independent of our revenue producing units  reports to the firm s chief risk officer  and is responsible for developing and implementing policies  methodologies and a formalized framework for operational risk management with the goal of minimizing our exposure to operational risk

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis operational risk management process managing operational risk requires timely and accurate information as well as a strong control culture 
we seek to manage our operational risk through the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating key operational risks across the firm  independent control and support functions that monitor operational risk on a daily basis and have instituted extensive policies and procedures and implemented controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events  proactive communication between our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions  and a network of systems throughout the firm to facilitate the collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational risk exposure 
we combine top down and bottom up approaches to manage and measure operational risk 
from a top down perspective  the firm s senior management assesses firmwide and business level operational risk profiles 
from a bottom up perspective  revenue producing units and independent control and support functions are responsible for risk management on a day to day basis  including identifying  mitigating  and escalating operational risks to senior management 
our operational risk framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under basel and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance 
our framework comprises the following practices risk identification and reporting  risk measurement  and risk monitoring 
internal audit performs a review of our operational risk framework  including our key controls  processes and applications  on an annual basis to assess the effectiveness of our framework 
risk identification and reporting the core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and reporting 
we have a comprehensive data collection process  including firmwide policies and procedures  for operational risk events 
we have established policies that require managers in our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions to escalate operational risk events 
when operational risk events are identified  our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in the firm s systems and or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events 
in addition  our firmwide systems capture internal operational risk event data  key metrics such as transaction volumes  and statistical information such as performance trends 
we use an internally developed operational risk management application to aggregate and organize this information 
managers from both revenue producing units and independent control and support functions analyze the information to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses  activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk 
we also provide periodic operational risk reports to senior management  risk committees and the board

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis risk measurement we measure the firm s operational risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses  which involve qualitative assessments of the potential frequency and extent of potential operational risk losses  for each of the firm s businesses 
operational risk measurement incorporates qualitative and quantitative assessments of factors including internal and external operational risk event data  assessments of the firm s internal controls  evaluations of the complexity of the firm s business activities  the degree of and potential for automation in the firm s processes  new product information  the legal and regulatory environment  changes in the markets for the firm s products and services  including the diversity and sophistication of the firm s customers and counterparties  and the liquidity of the capital markets and the reliability of the infrastructure that supports the capital markets 
the results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk 
these analyses ultimately are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold 
risk monitoring we evaluate changes in the operational risk profile of the firm and its businesses  including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which the firm operates  by monitoring the factors noted above at a firmwide level 
the firm has both detective and preventive internal controls  which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events 
we monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls
