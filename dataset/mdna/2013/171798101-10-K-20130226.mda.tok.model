item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and also with certain risks in item a of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this report for important information about these types of statements 
overview cimarex is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
our operations are entirely located in the united states  mainly in oklahoma  texas  new mexico  and kansas 
our principal business objective is to profitably grow proved reserves and production for the long term benefit of our shareholders through a diversified drilling portfolio 
our strategy centers on maximizing cash flow from producing properties and profitably reinvesting that cash flow in exploration and development 
we occasionally consider property acquisitions and mergers to enhance our competitive position 

table of contents in order to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk  we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
in recent years  we have shifted our capital expenditures to oil and liquids rich gas projects because of strong oil prices relative to gas prices 
we deal with volatility in commodity prices by maintaining flexibility in our capital investment program 
our operations are currently focused in two main areas the mid continent region and the permian basin 
the mid continent region consists of oklahoma  the texas panhandle  and southwest kansas 
our permian basin region encompasses west texas and southeast new mexico 
we also have operations in the gulf coast area  primarily in southeast texas 
growth is generally funded with cash flow provided by operating activities together with bank borrowings  sale of non strategic assets and occasional public financing 
conservative use of leverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet have long been a part of our financial strategy 
we have a long track record of profitable growth 
our revenue  profitability  and future growth are highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive 
prices impact the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to raise additional capital and the fair market value of our assets 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
an extended decline in oil and or gas prices could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  including the determination of full cost accounting ceiling test writedowns 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities  equity and proved reserves 
summary average daily production increased by to mmcfe d compared to mmcfe d in our combined permian basin and mid continent production grew to an all time high of mmcfe d  compared to mmcfe d in we added bcfe of proved reserves from extensions and discoveries  replacing of production 
proved reserves increased to tcfe 
adjusted for property sales  proved reserves increased 
exploration and development expenditures totaled billion 
cash flow provided by operating activities totaled billion 
net income was million  or per diluted share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share 
we issued million of senior notes at par and retired our senior notes 
total debt increased by million to million compared to million at year end we sold million of non strategic assets and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including repayment of outstanding bank debt 
drilling activities were focused almost exclusively in the permian basin and mid continent regions 
during  we drilled and completed gross net wells 
of total wells drilled  gross net were in the permian basin and gross net were in the mid continent 

table of contents we continue to evaluate and expand our acreage position in key long term future drilling projects 
during  we invested million in land and seismic 
in july  aggregate commitments on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility were increased from million to billion 
the credit facility provides for a borrowing base of billion and will mature on july  we did not have any bank debt outstanding at december  at december   our outstanding bank debt was million 
proved reserves year end proved reserves grew to tcfe  up from tcfe at year end the increase in proved reserves is net of production of bcfe and sales of bcfe 
proved reserves were developed at year end compared to at year end overall  approximately of proved reserves were in our mid continent region and in the permian basin 
reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled bcfe  replacing of production 
in our western oklahoma cana woodford shale area  we added bcfe from infill wells drilled and bcfe of proved undeveloped pud reserves 
development drilling in the permian basin added bcfe 
in total  reserve additions were comprised of oil and ngls and gas 
with continued focus on oil and liquids rich gas projects  the amount of proved reserves comprised of oil and ngls increased to as compared to at year end approximately bcfe of the bcfe net negative revisions during relate to production performance of certain wells recently drilled in our cana woodford shale project 
pud reserve additions in extensions and discoveries for now reflect revised expectations of future production performance 
the remainder of the net negative revision primarily resulted from decreases in prices bcfe  increases in operating expenses bcfe which shortened the economic lives  adjustments to previously booked pud reserves bcfe and the removal of pud locations due to altered future drilling plans bcfe 
the process of estimating quantities of oil  gas and ngl reserves is complex 
significant decisions are required in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history  contractual arrangements and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for further discussion regarding our proved reserves 
revenues most of our revenues are derived from sales of oil  gas and ngl production 
while revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices have had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
compared to  our average realized gas price decreased by and our average realized ngl price decreased by 
our average oil price decreased 
prices we receive are determined by prevailing market conditions 
regional and worldwide economic and geopolitical activity  weather and other variable factors influence market conditions  which often result in significant volatility in commodity prices 

table of contents the following table presents our average realized commodity prices 
realized prices do not include settlements of our commodity hedging contracts 
years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl ngl prices average realized sales price bbl on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in a million change in our gas revenues 
similarly  of our production was crude oil and ngls 
a per barrel change in our average realized sales prices would have resulted in an million change in our oil and ngl revenues 
see results of operations below for a discussion of the impact changes in realized prices had on our revenues 
production and other operating expenses costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with commodity prices  some trend with the type and volume of production and others are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in  gross wells 
production expense generally consists of the cost of water disposal  power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression and certain maintenance activity workovers necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we pay separately for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production 
therefore  fluctuations in oil and gas prices will impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves which reduces depletion expense 
lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves which increases depletion expense 
the costs of replacing production also impact our dd a rate 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities  estimates of operating and future development costs  and reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
accounting rules require us to perform a quarterly ceiling test calculation to test our oil and gas properties for possible impairment 
the primary components impacting this analysis are commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs  and depletion expense 
if the net capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties subject to amortization the carrying value exceeds the ceiling limitation  the excess would be expensed 
the ceiling limitation is equal to the sum of the present value discounted at of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  the cost of properties not being amortized  
table of contents the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized  and all related tax effects 
at december   the calculated value of the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to the test  and no impairment was necessary 
however  the amount of the excess has declined approximately since december  as of december   a decline of or more in the value of the ceiling limitation would have resulted in an impairment 
if negative trends continue we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
our g a expense is reported net of amounts reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties operated by cimarex and net of amounts capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting 
see results of operations below for a discussion of changes in production and other operating expenses 
derivative instruments hedging we periodically enter into derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our potential exposure to a decline in oil and or gas prices and the corresponding negative impact on cash flow available for reinvestment 
while the use of these instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price changes  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price changes 
for  we hedged about half of our anticipated oil production 
we did not hedge any of our gas or ngl production 
all of the oil contracts expired during without any cash settlements 
in we had approximately to of our anticipated oil production and to of projected gas production hedged 
those contracts were settled in for a net gain of million 
during we had approximately of our anticipated oil and gas production hedged 
those contracts settled in for a net gain of million 
as of december   we did not have any hedges in place 
subsequent to december  we entered into oil contracts as follows weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling swap feb dec collars  bbls wti feb dec swaps  bbls wti wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management view of underlying supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our hedging positions 
we have chosen not to apply hedge accounting treatment to any of the derivative contracts we have entered into since therefore  settlements on our derivative contracts do not impact our realized commodity prices during the periods they cover 
instead  any settlements on the contracts are shown as a component of operating costs and expenses as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments 
see item a and note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 

table of contents results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share 
for  we had net income of million  or per diluted share 
decreased revenues from lower realized commodity prices and higher dd a expense were the primary factors for the decrease in net income 
these changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows 
for the years ended december  percent change between price volume change commodity sales price volume total in thousands or as indicated gas sales oil sales ngl sales total commodity sales total gas volume mmcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day average oil price per barrel total ngl volume thousand barrels ngl volume barrels per day average ngl price per barrel total equivalent production volumes mmcfe per day commodity sales totaled billion in  compared to billion last year 
the year over year decline was attributable to a million decrease from lower prices  which was partially offset by million from higher oil and ngl production 
in  our aggregate production volumes were mmcfe per day  up from mcfe per day in in the fourth quarter of  our production volumes averaged a record mmcfe per day  or above mmcfe per day in the fourth quarter the period over period increases in volumes were a result of our successful drilling programs in the permian basin and mid continent region 
our gas production averaged mmcf per day  compared to mmcf per day for the decline in year over year gas production resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
during the fourth quarter of  our daily gas production averaged mmcf per day  down slightly from mmcf per day  for the same period of the decline in fourth quarter gas production resulted in million less revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of oil production for averaged  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day for in the increase in production provided an additional million of oil revenue 
our fourth quarter oil production averaged  barrels per day  an increase of compared to  barrels per day for the fourth quarter the higher production in the fourth quarter of increased oil sales by million 

table of contents in  our average daily ngl production volume was  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day for the higher volumes contributed million of additional revenue 
during the fourth quarter of  our average ngl production was  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day during the fourth quarter higher production provided an additional million of revenue in the fourth quarter 
the increases in our oil and ngl production reflect our continued focus on drilling oil and liquids rich gas wells in the permian basin and the cana woodford shale 
our average realized gas price for fell to per mcf  compared to per mcf in the decrease in gas prices resulted in million lower revenues compared to during the fourth quarter of  our average realized gas price decreased by to per mcf 
for the same period of we realized an average price of per mcf 
the decrease in realized prices in the fourth quarter caused our gas sales to be million lower than the same period of realized oil prices during averaged per barrel  a decrease of from the average price received in of per barrel 
this decrease resulted in lower oil revenue of million compared to for the fourth quarter of our average realized oil price was per barrel versus per barrel received in the fourth quarter of the decrease in fourth quarter oil sales due to the decrease in oil prices totaled million 
during our average realized price for ngls was per barrel  which was lower than the average realized price of per barrel received in the decrease in realized price resulted in lower ngl sales in of million 
in the fourth quarter of our average realized price for ngls was per barrel compared to an average realized price of per barrel received in the fourth quarter of the decrease in the fourth quarter ngl realized price resulted in lower ngl sales of million compared to the fourth quarter 
the changes in realized commodity prices were the result of overall market conditions 
we sometimes transport  process and market third party gas that is associated with our gas 
the table below reflects our pre tax operating margin revenues less direct expenses for third party gas gathering and processing as well as the marketing margin revenues less purchases for marketing third party gas 
for the years ended december  gas gathering  processing and marketing in thousands gas gathering  processing and other revenues gas gathering and processing costs gas gathering and processing margin gas marketing revenues  net of related costs the lower net margins from gas gathering and processing and gas marketing activities are primarily the result of lower volumes and prices associated with third party gas in versus 
table of contents in  our total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  processing and marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense increased to billion compared to million in analyses of the year over year differences are discussed below for the years ended december  per mcfe variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a asset retirement obligation production transportation taxes other than income general and administrative stock compensation gain on derivative instruments  net   n a n a other operating  net    n a n a our dd a expense increased to million  compared to million in the million increase accounted for of the aggregate increase in operating costs and expenses 
dd a per mcfe increased by to from 
the higher dd a rate is primarily from increasing costs of reserves added and the effect of lower prices resulting in negative reserve revisions 
we expect the average dd a rate to increase modestly during asset retirement obligation expense increased by to million in the increase resulted from higher estimated plugging and abandonment costs in the permian basin and gulf of mexico 
our production costs consist of lease operating expense and workover expense as follows for the years ended december  per mcfe variance between in thousands lease operating expense workover expense lease operating expense in increased by compared to higher costs were associated with compressor rentals and field employees 
the lower rate per mcfe was primarily a function of increased production volumes and efficiencies of horizontal well operations for compared to workover expense for was slightly higher than such costs will fluctuate based on the amount of maintenance and remedial activity planned and or required during the period 
our transportation costs were relatively flat compared to transportation costs will vary based on increases or decreases in sales volumes  compression charges and fuel cost 
taxes other than income are assessed by state and local taxing authorities on production  revenues or the value of properties 
revenue based severance taxes are the largest component of these taxes 
our taxes decreased due to lower gas and ngl prices  a reduced tax rate on oklahoma horizontal deep wells and a refund for taxes in prior years 

table of contents general and administrative g a costs were as follows for the years ended december  variance between in thousands g a capitalized to oil and gas properties g a expense g a expense per mcfe our overall g a cost increased compared to primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits 
the increase in g a expense includes million of death benefits paid to the estate of former chairman  fh merelli  as per his employment contract 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock option awards  net of amounts capitalized 
in accordance with our stock incentive plan  such grants are periodically made to non employee directors  officers and other eligible employees 
we have recognized non cash stock based compensation cost as follows for the years ended december  variance between in thousands performance based restricted stock awards service based restricted stock awards restricted unit awards restricted stock and units stock option awards total stock compensation less amounts capitalized to oil and gas properties stock compensation expense associated with stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant date market value of the award and the number of shares granted 
the cost for the performance based awards includes million of accelerated compensation expense related to the death of former chairman  fh merelli 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for further discussion regarding our stock based compensation 
net gain or loss on derivative instruments includes both realized gains and losses on settlements of derivative contracts and unrealized gains and losses stemming from changes in the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments 
we have not elected hedge accounting treatment for derivative contracts 
therefore  we recognize all realized settlements and unrealized changes in fair value in operating costs and expenses 

table of contents the following table reflects our net realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments for the years ended december  variance between in thousands realized gain on settlement of derivative instruments unrealized gain from changes to the fair value of the derivative instruments gain on derivative instruments  net realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices and the monthly settlement of the instruments 
see item a and note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
other operating expense consists of costs related to various legal matters  most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
the million increase in expense during resulted primarily from a fourth quarter million accrual for a mediated royalty litigation settlement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for further information regarding litigation matters 
other income and expense for the years ended december  variance between in thousands interest expense capitalized interest loss on early extinguishment of debt other  net our interest expense includes interest on debt and amortization of financing costs 
during  debt outstanding increased to million from million 
we capitalize interest primarily on the cost of drilling and completing wells and constructing qualified assets 
the higher capitalized interest in was due to higher costs on which interest was calculated 
in connection with the retirement of our senior notes  we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of the retirement of our notes and the issuance of our senior notes are described in more detail under long term debt below 
components of other  net consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  income and expense associated with other non operating activities  miscellaneous asset sales and interest income 
the million increase in was mainly due to increased income from non operating activities 

table of contents income tax expense the components of our provision for income taxes are as follows for the years ended december  in thousands current benefit deferred taxes combined federal and state effective income tax rate our income tax expense benefit differs from the statutory rate of due to the effects of state income taxes  the domestic production activities allowance and other permanent differences 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for further information regarding our income taxes 
results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
for we had net income of million  or per diluted share 
in  increased revenues from higher realized oil and ngl prices were more than offset by higher dd a and production expenses compared to these changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows 
for the years ended december  percent change between price volume change commodity sales price volume total in thousands or as indicated gas sales oil sales ngl sales total commodity sales total gas volume mmcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day average oil price per barrel total ngl volume thousand barrels ngl volume barrels per day average ngl price per barrel total equivalent production volumes mmcfe per day commodity sales during totaled billion  compared to billion in the increase was a result of higher realized prices for oil and ngls 

table of contents in  our aggregate production volumes were mmcfe per day  down from mcfe per day in aggregate daily production volumes for the fourth quarter of were mmcfe  also down from mmcfe for the same period of our permian basin and mid continent production volumes continue to increase as a result of our successful drilling programs 
however  these increases are being offset by decreased gulf coast production 
the lower output from the gulf coast is a result of natural declines in the highly productive wells previously drilled near beaumont  texas combined with a lack of exploration success from our gulf coast drilling program 
our gas production averaged mmcf per day  compared to mmcf per day for the decline in year over year gas production resulted in a decrease in revenue of million 
during the fourth quarter of our daily gas production averaged mmcf per day  down from mmcf per day  for the same period of the decline in fourth quarter gas production resulted in million less revenue compared to the fourth quarter of oil production for averaged  barrels per day  down slightly from production of  barrels per day in the decrease in production resulted in million lower oil revenue for all of our fourth quarter oil production averaged  barrels per day  or a slight increase compared to daily oil production of  barrels for the fourth quarter of the higher production in the fourth quarter of increased oil sales by million 
in our average daily ngl production volume was  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day for the higher ngl production volumes in contributed million of additional revenue for during the fourth quarter of our average daily ngl production was  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day during the fourth quarter of this increase in ngl production provided an additional million of revenue in the fourth quarter of the increases in our ngl production reflect our continued focus on drilling in more liquids rich gas basins that produce more attractively priced ngl liquids such as ethane  propane and butane  rather than in gas basins that produce dry gas alone 
our average realized gas price for fell to per mcf  compared to per mcf in the decrease in prices received during resulted in lower gas sales of million in compared to gas revenue 
during the fourth quarter of our average realized gas price decreased by to per mcf 
for the same period of  we realized an average price per mcf of 
the decrease in prices received in the fourth quarter of resulted in million less in gas sales compared to the same period of realized oil prices during averaged per barrel  an increase of over the average price received for oil in of per barrel 
this increase resulted in an additional million of oil sales in for the fourth quarter of our average realized oil price was per barrel versus per barrel received in the fourth quarter of the increase in fourth quarter oil sales due to the increase in oil prices totaled million 
during our average realized price for ngls was per barrel  which was higher than the average realized price of per barrel received in the increase in realized price resulted in an additional million for ngl sales in in the fourth quarter of our average realized price for ngls was per barrel compared to an average realized price of per barrel received in the 
table of contents fourth quarter of the increase in the fourth quarter ngl realized price contributed million of additional revenue

for dd a was million  compared to million in the million increase in expense represents of the total increase in operating costs and expenses 
on a unit of production basis  the dd a rate for was per mcfe  up from per mcfe for the dd a rate in was lower as a result of impairments to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties recorded during the last half of and the first quarter of asset retirement obligation expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to unforeseen modifications and or problems that occurred at the time of actual abandonment and site restoration  which resulted in our actual costs exceeding our estimated asset retirement obligation 
in our production costs were million per mcfe up from million per mcfe during the million increase accounted for of our total increase in operating costs and expenses 

table of contents our production costs consist of lease operating expense and workover expense as follows for the years ended december  per mcfe variance between in thousands lease operating expense workover expense about half of the million increase in our lease operating expense resulted from higher water disposal costs associated with wells coming on line from our successful permian basin and mid continent drilling programs 
increased costs for equipment maintenance  rentals  labor  power and fuel also contributed to the increase in year over year lease operating expense 
workover expense for was million higher than  primarily as a result of more activity being necessary in transportation costs rose to million per mcfe for from million per mcfe in transportation costs will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in sales volumes  compression charges and fluctuation in the price of the fuel cost component 
also  in the latter part of and continuing throughout  our mid continent and permian basin wells have experienced increases in transportation rates due to higher contractual rates associated with new wells coming online and contracts for existing wells being renewed 
taxes other than income increased million from million in to million in the million increase in taxes resulted primarily from higher realized oil and ngl prices in general and administrative costs were as follows for the years ended december  variance between in thousands g a capitalized to oil and gas properties g a expense g a expense per mcfe the decrease in g a was mostly due to lower bonus expense in

we have recognized non cash stock based compensation cost as follows for the years ended december  variance between in thousands performance based restricted stock awards service based restricted stock awards restricted unit awards restricted stock and units stock option awards total stock compensation less amounts capitalized to oil and gas properties stock compensation expense associated with stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant date market value of the award and the number of awards granted 
the million increase in total stock compensation compared to the total expense resulted primarily from the increased price per share of our common stock on the date of grants in compared to the grant date value of previous awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a detailed discussion regarding our stock based compensation 
our net gain or loss on derivative instruments includes both realized gains and losses on settlements of our derivative contracts and unrealized gains and losses stemming from changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments based on published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodity as of the date of the estimate 
for collars  we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility  market prices and contract terms 
the fair value of our derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of counterparty credit risk  and the fair value of instruments in a liability position include a measure of our own nonperformance risk 
these credit risks are based on current published credit default swap rates 
we did not elect hedge accounting treatment for derivative contracts outstanding in and therefore we recognized all realized settlements and unrealized changes in fair value in our operating costs and expenses 
the following table reflects our net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for the years ended december  variance between in thousands realized gain on settlement of derivative instruments unrealized gain from changes to the fair value of the derivative instruments gain on derivative instruments  net realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices and the monthly settlement of the instruments

table of contents prices in the million of lower gains accounted for of our total increase in operating costs and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our derivative instruments 
other operating  net expense consists of costs related to various legal matters  most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
other operating  net increased from million in to million for expenses for were significantly lower than in due to the favorable resolution of items in that had been accrued in prior years

capitalized interest remained relatively flat for both and on july   certain holders of our floating rate convertible notes elected to convert their notes 
the holders received million and  shares of common stock 
we recorded a gain of million on the settlement of the notes 
components of other  net consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including  gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  other miscellaneous asset sales  income and expense from other non operating activities and interest income 
the million increase in was mainly due to sales of oil and gas well equipment and supplies 
income tax expense the components of our provision for income taxes are as follows for the years ended december  in thousands current taxes benefit deferred taxes combined federal and state effective income tax rate the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate of due to the effects of state income taxes  the domestic production activities allowance and other permanent differences

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our liquidity is highly dependent on the commodity price we receive for the oil  gas and ngls we produce 
commodity prices are market driven  have been very volatile and therefore  we cannot predict future commodity prices 
prices received for production heavily influence our revenue  cash flow  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
natural gas prices have been in decline since year end  the result of increasing supply coupled with lower demand caused by exceptionally mild winters 
oil and ngl prices have fluctuated during due to supply and demand factors  seasonality and other geopolitical and economic factors 
it is likely that future prices for these commodities will continue to fluctuate 
we deal with volatility in commodity prices by maintaining flexibility in our capital investment program 
based on current commodity prices  our e d capital expenditures are expected to range from billion 
nearly all the capital is directed towards oil and liquids rich gas opportunities in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
actual amounts invested will depend on our calculated rates of return 
our e d expenditures have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
during  e d expenditures of billion were largely funded by operating cash flow and the sale of million of non strategic assets 
we expect our e d capital expenditures to be funded by operating cash flow and long term debt 
we have hedged a portion of our oil production to protect our operating cash flow for reinvestment 
from time to time we consider acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions is unpredictable 
at december   our long term debt consisted of million of senior notes 
debt to total capitalization was 
the reconciliation of debt to total capitalization  which is a non gaap measure  is long term debt million divided by long term debt plus stockholders equity billion 
management believes that this non gaap measure is useful information as it is a common statistic used in the investment community 
we believe that our operating cash flow and other capital resources will be adequate to meet our needs for planned capital expenditures  working capital  debt servicing and dividend payments in and beyond 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are operating cash flow  borrowings under our bank credit facility  asset sales and public offerings of debt securities 
our primary uses of funds are exploration  development  leasehold and property acquisition  debt service and common stock dividends 

table of contents the following table presents our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents from to capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis 
these amounts differ from capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this report

this was partially offset by a million increase from higher oil and ngls production in the increase in over was due to higher realized prices for oil and ngls 
cash flow used in investing activities for both and was billion 
for  cash flow used in investing activities was million 
changes in cash flow used in investing activities generally result from changes in our capital expenditures and acquisitions net of asset sales 
in  we had e d and other capital expenditures of billion which were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of million 
for  e d expenditures and other capital expenditures were billion with proceeds from asset sales of million 
in  e d and other capital expenditures were billion which were partially offset by asset sales of million 
during  net cash flow provided by financing activities was million compared to million in other long term debt increased million and we received proceeds of million from issuance of common stock 
these increases were offset by debt payments of million  million of dividends paid  and financing costs of million 
we issued million of senior notes in and used the proceeds to retire the million senior notes outstanding and pay down bank debt 
in  our net cash inflow was the result of net bank borrowing of million plus million from the issuance of common stock  less million of dividend payments and million of financing costs 
net cash used in financing activities was million in cash inflows of million from the issuance of common stock were more than offset by debt repayments of million and dividend payments of million during the year 

table of contents reconciliation of adjusted cash flow from operations for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities change in operating assets and liabilities adjusted cash flow from operations management believes that the non gaap measure of adjusted cash flow from operations is useful information for investors 
it is accepted by the investment community as a means of measuring the company ability to fund its capital program without reflecting fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities which are included in the gaap measure of cash flow from operating activities 
it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures for oil and gas acquisitions  exploration and development activities and property sales for years ended december  in thousands acquisitions proved unproved exploration and development land seismic exploration development property sales capital expenditures in the table above are presented on an accrual basis 
additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis  when payments are made 
in  our e d expenditures were billion compared to billion in and billion in of total expenditures  were for projects in the permian basin primarily in the delaware basin of southeast new mexico and west texas and approximately were in the mid continent region  mostly in the cana woodford shale play 

table of contents the following table reflects wells drilled by region for the years ended december  gross wells permian basin mid continent gulf coast other net wells permian basin mid continent gulf coast other gross wells completed as producers full year e d capital expenditures are expected to range from billion  most of which will be directed towards drilling oil and liquids rich gas wells in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
we expect our e d capital expenditures to be funded from cash flow and long term debt 
the timing of capital expenditures and the receipt of cash flows do not necessarily match causing us to borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangement throughout the year 
as has been our historical practice  we regularly review our capital expenditures throughout the year and will adjust our investments based on changes in commodity prices  service costs and drilling success 
we have the flexibility to adjust our capital expenditures based upon market conditions 
we made property acquisitions of million during  most of which were in the permian basin 
property acquisitions totaled approximately million in and in which were used to purchase additional interests in the cana woodford shale play 
in  we sold interests in non core oil and gas assets for million 
of this total  million  which occurred in the fourth quarter  was related to non core oil and gas assets located in texas 
in august  we sold all of our interests in assets located in sublette county  wyoming for million including purchase price adjustments 
the assets sold principally consisted of a gas processing plant under construction and bcf of proved undeveloped gas reserves 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of proved reserves as the disposition did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
during  we also sold million of various non core interests including assets in lea county  new mexico and willacy county  texas 
various interests in oil and gas properties were sold during for million  most of which were non core mississippi assets 
we intend to continue to actively evaluate acquisitions and dispositions relative to our property holdings  particularly in our core areas of operation 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact 
our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in more detail in exploration and development activity overview under item of this report 

table of contents financial condition future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables including success in finding and producing new reserves  production from existing wells and realized commodity prices 
to meet capital and liquidity requirements  we rely on certain resources  including cash flows from operating activities  bank borrowings and access to capital markets 
we periodically use our credit facility to finance our working capital needs 
during  our total assets increased million to billion  up from billion at december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net oil and gas properties 
total liabilities at year end increased to billion  up million from the billion reported at year end this was mainly due to an increase of million in long term debt and a million increase in deferred income taxes 
on december   stockholders equity totaled billion  up million from december  the increase is mostly related to our net income 
dividends a quarterly cash dividend has been paid to shareholders every quarter since the first quarter of in february  the quarterly dividend was increased to per share from per share 
future dividend payments will depend on our level of earnings  financial requirements and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
dividend declared in millions dividend per share working capital analysis our working capital fluctuates primarily as a result of our exploration and development activities  realized commodity prices and our operating activities 
working capital is also impacted by income tax receivables or payables  property sales  accrued g a and changes in inventory balances 
working capital decreased million from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the decrease in working capital was a result of the following a million decrease in our income tax receivable 
operations related accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million 
operations related accounts receivable decreased by million 
working capital decreases were partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  primarily the result of property sales which closed in december a decrease of million in accrued liabilities related to our e d expenditures 
accounts receivable are a major component of working capital and include a diverse group of companies comprised of major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and other end users 
the collection of receivables during the periods presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 

table of contents long term debt debt at december   and december   consisted of the following in thousands bank debt senior notes due senior notes due total long term debt bank debt we have a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility that matures july  the credit facility provides for a borrowing base of billion 
aggregate commitments from our lenders increased from million to billion in july under our credit facility  the borrowing base is determined at the discretion of lenders based on the value of our proved reserves 
the next regular annual redetermination is april  as of december   we had no bank debt outstanding 
we had letters of credit outstanding of million leaving an unused borrowing availability of million 
during  we had average daily bank debt outstanding of million  compared to million in our highest amount of bank borrowings outstanding during was million in december 
during  the highest amount of outstanding bank borrowings was million in july 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility may bear interest at either a libor plus  based on our leverage ratio  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii adjusted one month libor plus plus  in each case  an additional  based on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility also has financial covenants that include the maintenance of current assets including unused bank commitments to current liabilities of greater than to we also must maintain a leverage ratio of total debt to earnings before interest expense  income taxes and noncash items such as dd a expense  unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives  ceiling test writedowns and goodwill impairments of not more than to other covenants could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock or sell assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and nonfinancial covenants 
notes due in april  we issued million of senior notes due may   with interest payable semiannually in may and november 
the notes were sold to the public at par 
these notes are governed by an indenture containing certain covenants  events of default and other restrictive provisions 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may   at a redemption price of of the principal amount as of may   declining to on may  and thereafter 
net proceeds from the offering approximated million  after underwriting discounts and offering costs 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to retire our senior notes 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of million outstanding under our credit facility 

table of contents notes due in may  we issued million of senior unsecured notes at par which were scheduled to mature may  on march   we commenced a cash tender offer tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding senior notes 
under the terms of the tender offer  holders who tendered their notes on or prior to april   received  per  in principal amount of notes tendered plus a consent payment of per  in principal amount of notes tendered 
as of april   a total of  of notes had been redeemed 
in may  the remaining notes were redeemed at of the principal amount 
we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of in conjunction with the tender offer  holders who tendered their notes were deemed to consent to proposed amendments to eliminate or modify certain covenants and events of default and other provisions contained in the indenture governing the senior notes 
off balance sheet arrangements we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   our material off balance sheet arrangements included operating lease agreements which are customary in the oil and gas industry 
contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt fixed rate interest payments operating leases drilling commitments gathering facilities and pipelines asset retirement obligation other liabilities firm transportation see item interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
we have drilling commitments of approximately million consisting of obligations to finish drilling and completing wells in progress at december  we also have various commitments for drilling rigs as well as certain service contracts 
the total minimum expenditure commitments under these agreements are million 
we have projects in oklahoma  new mexico  and texas where we are constructing gathering facilities and pipelines 
at december   we had commitments of million relating to this construction 
we have not included the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
other liabilities include the fair value of our liabilities associated with our benefit obligations and other miscellaneous commitments 

table of contents at december   we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next months 
in total  our financial exposure would be approximately million should this gas not be delivered 
our exposure will fluctuate with price volatility and actual volumes delivered  however  we believe cimarex has no financial exposure from these contracts based on our current proved reserves and production levels 
in the normal course of business we have various other delivery commitments which are not material individually or in the aggregate 
all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that estimated net cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing bank credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs 
outlook our e d capital investment is presently expected to be in the range of billion 
nearly all of this capital will be used for drilling oil and liquids rich gas wells in the permian basin and cana woodford shale play 
we have a large inventory of drilling opportunities  limited lease expirations and few service commitments 
we regularly review our capital expenditures and may adjust our investments based on changes in commodity prices  service costs and drilling success 
actual amounts invested will depend on our calculated rates of return which are significantly influenced by commodity prices 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 
production for is projected to be in the range of mmcfe per day  an increase over liquids are projected to account for of total equivalent production  up from in the prior year 
combined mid continent and permian basin production volumes are projected to grow in  averaging between mmcfe per day 
gulf coast volumes are projected to average mmcfe per day 
revenues from oil  gas and ngl sales are dependent not only on the level actually produced  but also on the price received 
during  realized prices averaged per barrel of oil  per mcf of gas and per barrel of ngl 
commodity prices can be volatile and the possibility of realized prices varying from those received in is high 
certain expenses for on a per mcfe basis are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative taxes other than income of oil and gas revenue 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
at year end  of our total proved reserves are categorized as puds 
all of the pud reserves are related to the cana woodford shale play 
our reserve engineers review and revise these reserve estimates regularly  as new information becomes available 
we use the units of production method to amortize the cost associated with our oil and gas properties 
changes in estimates of reserve quantities and commodity prices will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense  or in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and revisions resulting from better information about production history  well performance and production costs 
approximately bcfe of the bcfe net negative revisions during relate to production performance of certain wells recently drilled in our cana woodford shale project 
pud reserve additions in extensions and discoveries for now reflect revised expectations of future production performance 
the remainder of the net negative revision primarily resulted from decreases in prices bcfe  increases 
table of contents in operating expenses bcfe which shortened the economic lives  adjustments to previously booked pud reserves bcfe and the removal of pud locations due to altered future drilling plans bcfe 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures in this report for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
under the full cost method  no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposition of oil and gas properties unless such disposition would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
companies that follow the full cost accounting method are required to make a quarterly ceiling test calculation 
this test ensures that total capitalized costs for oil and gas properties net of accumulated dd a and deferred income taxes do not exceed the sum of the present value discounted at of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized and all related tax effects 
we currently do not have any unproven properties being amortized 
revenue calculations in the reserves are based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity price for the prior twelve months 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or commodity price will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be expensed 
recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible 
quarterly and annual ceiling tests are primarily impacted by commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense 
as of december   the calculated value of the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of our oil and gas properties subject to the test  therefore  no impairment was necessary 
however  the amount of the excess has declined approximately since december  as of december   a decline of in the value of the ceiling limitation would have caused an impairment 
if negative trends continue  we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method  whereby capitalized costs  including future development costs and asset retirement obligations  are amortized over total estimated proved reserves 
changes in our estimate of proved reserve quantities and commodity prices will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to these changes 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties  including those in wells in progress  are excluded from the costs 
table of contents being amortized 
we do not have major development projects that are excluded from costs being amortized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate excluded costs for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves or impairments 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to production expense in the period incurred 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment at least annually 
in  we adopted fasb accounting standards update no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
asu allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not with a greater than threshold that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired then it is written down to a calculated fair value by charging the impairment to expense 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the possibility that goodwill may be impaired 
based upon our assessment at december   goodwill was not impaired 
however  it is possible that goodwill could become impaired in the future if commodity prices or other economic factors become less favorable 
a goodwill impairment charge would have no effect on liquidity or our capital resources  but could adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that our goodwill was overstated due to certain errors in the calculation of net deferred tax liability in conjunction with our business combination 
we have concluded this is an immaterial correction of error and we have restated the accompanying balance sheet as of december   to decrease both goodwill and deferred income tax liability by million 
the errors were noncash and had no effect on our statements of income and comprehensive income  cash flow or stockholders equity 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental  and other contingencies periodically to determine if we should record losses 
at december   we have not made any accruals related to environmental remediation costs 
however  we may be required to make such estimates in future periods if applicable laws and regulations change or if the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations change 
other factors  such as unanticipated construction problems or identification of areas of contaminated soil or groundwater  could also cause us to accrue for such costs 
hitch enterprises  inc et al 
v 
cimarex energy co 
et al 
on december   cimarex entered into a preliminary resolution of the hitch enterprises  inc  et al 
v 
cimarex energy co  et al 
hitch litigation matter for million 
hitch was filed as a statewide royalty putative class action in the federal district court in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the settlement was reached at a mediation  which occurred after the parties began to exchange information  including damage analyses  on november  the court has entered an order preliminarily approving the 
table of contents parties settlement 
the deadline for putative class members to opt out of the settlement class was february   and less than of the class members opted out 
the court will hold the settlement fairness hearing on march  in the fourth quarter of  we accrued million for this matter 
hb krug  et al 
versus h p in january  the tulsa county district court issued a judgment totaling million in the hb krug  et al 
versus helmerich payne  inc h p case 
this lawsuit originally was filed in and addressed h p conduct pertaining to a take or pay settlement  along with potential drainage and other related issues 
pursuant to the spin off transaction to shareholders of h p  by which cimarex became a publicly traded entity  cimarex assumed the assets and liabilities of h p exploration and production business  including this lawsuit 
in we recorded a litigation expense of million for this lawsuit 
we have accrued additional post judgment interest and costs during the appeal of the district court judgment 
on august   the oklahoma court of appeals issued an opinion regarding the krug litigation 
the oklahoma court of appeals reversed and remanded the million disgorgement of profits award  holding the district court erred in failing to make the required findings of fact and conclusions of law 
in all other respects  the court of appeals affirmed the judgment  including damages of million 
on february  the oklahoma supreme court granted cimarex petition for certiorari  which requested a review of the affirmed portion of the judgment 
we are awaiting a ruling from the oklahoma supreme court  and the final outcome cannot be determined at this time 
if the district court original judgment is ultimately affirmed in its entirety  the million  plus the then determined amount of post judgment interest and costs would become payable 
in the normal course of business  we have other various litigation matters 
we assess the probability of estimable amounts related to litigation matters in accordance with guidance established by the financial accounting standards board fasb and adjust our accruals accordingly 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see note of this report for additional information regarding our contingencies 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to retire long lived assets at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
our asset retirement obligation is determined by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of inception with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
the cost of the tangible asset  including the asset retirement cost  is depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
asset retirement liability is determined using significant assumptions including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of assets and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations 
recently issued accounting standards no significant accounting standards applicable to cimarex have been issued during the year ended december  
table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil  gas and ngl production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil  gas and ngls has been volatile and unpredictable 
to manage exposure to commodity prices  we periodically hedge a portion of the price risk associated with future oil and gas production 
the goal of these arrangements is to decrease our exposure to price volatility thereby increasing the predictability of future cash flow 
however  hedges can also limit potential gains if oil and gas prices rise above the price established by the hedges 
at december   we had no hedges in place 
subsequent to december   we entered into oil collars and swaps 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
counterparty credit risk did not have a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and commodity derivative valuations 
this is primarily because we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties and because our derivative contracts are held with investment grade counterparties that are also part of our credit facility 
interest rate risk at december   our long term debt consisted of million in senior notes that will mature may  because all of our long term debt is at a fixed rate  we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal 
the sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term nature of such instruments 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding debt
