you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated statements of condition as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income  changes in equity  and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
general overview we conduct community banking activities by accepting deposits and making loans in our market area 
our lending products include residential mortgage loans  multi family and commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans and  to a lesser extent  construction and consumer loans 
we 
table of contents also maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities to manage our liquidity and interest rate risk 
our loan and investment portfolios are funded with deposits as well as collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh and commercial banks 
income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in our portfolio and changes in levels of interest rates 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon our ability to prudently manage the balance sheet for growth  combined with how successfully we maintain our net interest margin  which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
a secondary source of income is noninterest income  or other income  which is revenue that we receive from providing products and services 
the majority of our non interest income generally comes from fee income on deposit accounts such as cash management fee income on commercial accounts and service charge income on retail accounts as well as loan fee income from mortgage servicing and lending relationships such as unused line fees and warehouse line satisfaction fees 
we also earn income on bank owned life insurance and receive income from our investment in philadelphia mortgage advisors 
in some years  we recognize income from the sale of loans  securities and assets acquired through foreclosure 
provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management best estimate of probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based upon management evaluation of the portfolio collectability 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged against income 
charge offs  if any  are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific impaired loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management judgment  should be charged off 
expenses 
the noninterest expense we incur in operating our business consists of salaries  benefits and other compensation expenses  occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  data processing costs  professional fees  marketing expenses  federal deposit insurance corporation premiums  assets acquired through foreclosure expense including valuation adjustments and various other miscellaneous expenses 
our largest noninterest expense is for salaries  benefits and other compensation  which consists primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes  expenses for health insurance  retirement plans  director and committee fees and other employee benefits  including employer k plan contributions  employee stock ownership plan allocations and equity incentive awards  such as stock options and shares of restricted stock 
occupancy expense includes the fixed and variable costs of buildings such as depreciation charges  maintenance  real estate taxes and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for buildings and premises 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease 
furniture and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of furniture and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses and maintenance 
depreciation of equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 

table of contents data processing costs include fees paid to our third party data processing service  software and connectivity providers 
professional fees include fees paid to our independent auditors  co sourced internal auditors  attorneys  compensation consultants  loan review specialists and interest rate risk management vendors 
marketing expense includes expenses for advertisements  promotions and premium items and public relations expenses 
federal deposit insurance corporation assessments are a specified percentage of total assets less equity  depending on the risk characteristics of the institution 
the fdic implemented changes in its assessment rules in resulting from the dodd frank act  which reduced the amount of our assessments 
assets acquired through foreclosure expense includes declines in the carrying values of other real estate owned oreo after we have acquired a property  changes in the fair value of financial assets acquired through foreclosure and holding costs related to these assets  net of any rental income received 
loss of extinguishment of debt includes fees paid to terminate borrowings in prior to their contractual maturities 
other expenses include expenses for stationary  printing  supplies  telephone  postage  contributions and donations  regulatory assessments  insurance premiums  certain public company expenses and other fees and expenses 
our business strategy our goal is to be the leading relationship based business and consumer bank in the markets we serve by delivering a wide array of financial products and personalized customer service 
we believe there is a significant opportunity for a community focused bank to provide a full range of financial services to small and middle market commercial and retail customers 
further  by offering quicker decision making in the delivery of banking products and services  offering customized products where appropriate and providing access to senior officers  we can distinguish ourselves from the larger banks operating in our market area 
at the same time  our capital base and greater product mix enables us to effectively compete against smaller banks 
the following are the key elements of our business strategy improve earnings through an emphasis on business banking 
emphasizing business banking improves our profitability because commercial loans generally produce higher interest rates and the associated commercial business relationships produce higher deposit balances and fee income than consumer relationships 
in this regard  we have added personnel to assist us in increasing our commercial business lending 
we are also seeking to increase our commercial deposits and our cash management services through our increase in commercial lending 
improve asset quality 
we have sought to maintain our asset quality and moderate credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards 
since  we have tightened our underwriting standards  including reducing loan to value ratios  and de emphasizing certain types of lending  such as construction loans and home equity lending 
further  we have strengthened our oversight of problem assets through the formation of a special assets group in december the department  which is run by our chief operating officer and consists of other loan and credit administration officers  increases the frequency with which classified and criticized credits are reviewed and aggressively acts to resolve problem assets 
although we intend to continue our efforts to originate commercial real estate and business loans  we intend to manage loan exposures and concentrations through conservative loan underwriting and credit administration standards 

table of contents improve our funding mix by focusing on core deposits 
our strategic focus is to emphasize total relationship banking with our customers to internally fund our loan growth 
we believe that a continued focus on customer relationships will increase our level of core deposits demand  savings and money market accounts 
we value core deposits because they represent longer term customer relationships and a lower cost of funding compared to certificates of deposit 
in addition to our retail branch network  we offer on line banking and a variety of deposit accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area  including remote capture products  sweep accounts and other cash management products and services 
actively manage our balance sheet 
recent economic conditions have underscored the importance of a strong balance sheet 
we strive to achieve this through managing our interest rate risk and maintaining strong capital levels  loan loss reserves and liquidity 
diversifying our asset mix not only improves our net interest margin but also reduces the exposure of our net interest income and earnings to interest rate risk 
we will continue to manage our interest rate risk by diversifying the type and maturity of our assets in our loan and investment portfolios and monitoring the maturities in our deposit portfolio and borrowing facilities 
it is possible that existing minimum regulatory capital ratios may be increased by regulatory agencies in response to market and economic conditions 
grow through geographic expansion 
we intend to pursue expansion in our market area in strategic locations that maximize growth opportunities 
we believe the previous economic recession and increasing regulatory burden will increase the rate of consolidation in the banking industry 
we will look for opportunities to expand through the acquisition of banks or other financial service companies or the acquisition of branches of other financial institutions 
we currently do not have any specific plans for any such acquisitions 
we will consider those opportunities that will allow us to add complementary products to our existing business or expand our franchise geographically 
continued expense control 
management continues to focus on the level of noninterest expenses and methods to identify cost savings opportunities  such as reviewing the number of employees  renegotiating key third party contracts and reducing certain other operating expenses 
in this regard  our efficiency ratios were  and for  and  respectively 
continue to serve as a strong community citizen 
as a community bank operating for approximately years  we are uniquely positioned to understand the financial needs of our local customers 
further  we believe it is the role of a community bank to operate as a good corporate citizen 
towards that end  in  we established the fox chase bank charitable foundation and funded it with  shares of old fox chase bancorp common stock and  in cash 
the foundation provides grants to non profit organizations and programs in the communities we serve 
we also provide support to organizations with which our employees and customers are involved through our participation in the neighborhood commitment program 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses 
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
table of contents under different assumptions or conditions  resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management best estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio  based upon management evaluation of the portfolio collectability 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of an allowance on impaired loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for losses on the entire portfolio 
loans are deemed impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all proceeds due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when a loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan original effective interest rate  the loan obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company establishes an allowance for loan losses in the amount of the difference between fair value of the impaired loan and the loan carrying amount 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not considered impaired to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and assigning percentages  known as loss factors  to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors include the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the company loss experience by particular segment  trends and absolute levels of nonperforming loans  trends and absolute levels of classified and criticized loans  trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans  trends in risk ratings  trends in industry charge offs and changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy 
these loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we perform this systematic analysis of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
these criteria are analyzed and the allowance is developed and maintained at the segment level 
additional risk is associated with the analysis of the allowance for loan losses as such evaluations are highly subjective  and future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize adjustments to the allowance  based on their judgments at the time of their examination 
for additional discussion  see risk management analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments 
table of contents and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
valuation and other than temporary impairment of investment securities 
investment securities are reviewed quarterly to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value 
when the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its current carrying value  management is required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary 
a review of other than temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the nature of the decline  and the probability  extent and timing of a valuation recovery and our intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery of its amortized cost 
pursuant to these requirements  we assess valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial condition  business prospects or other factors  or market related factors  such as required market yields  interest rates or equity market declines 
if the decline in the market value of a security is determined to be other than temporary  the credit portion of the impairment is written down through earnings and the non credit portion is an adjustment to other comprehensive income 
valuation assets acquired through foreclosure 
assets acquired through foreclosure consist of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
the fair value of other real estate owned is determined using appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers or agreements of sale  where applicable 
financial assets acquired from debtors are carried at fair value under the fair value option in accordance with fasb asc financial instruments 
the fair value of financial assets acquired from debtors is determined using valuations obtained from a third party valuation firm who utilizes a discounted cash flow model 
changes in the fair value of assets acquired through foreclosure at future reporting dates or at the time of disposition will result in assets acquired through foreclosure expense or net gain loss on sale of assets acquired through foreclosure  respectively

risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
in the normal course of its business  the company encounters two significant types of risk economic risk and regulatory risk 
there are three main components of economic risk interest rate risk  credit risk and market risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or on a different basis  from its interest earning assets 
the company primary credit risk is the risk of defaults in the company loan portfolio that result from borrowers inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments 
the company also has credit risk related to the risk of defaults in its investment securities portfolio 
the ability of the company to realize the full value of its investment securities upon maturity or sale depends on several factors  including the cash flows  credit enhancements and underlying structures of the individual investment securities 
market risk reflects changes in the value of the collateral underlying loans  the valuation of assets acquired through foreclosure and the valuation of loans held for sale  securities  mortgage servicing assets and other investments 
the company is subject to the regulations of various government agencies 
these regulations may change significantly from period to period 
the company also undergoes periodic examinations by regulatory agencies that may subject them to further changes with respect to asset valuations and classifications  amounts required for the allowance for loan losses and operating restrictions resulting from the regulators judgment based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers due to unforeseen circumstances 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
our special assets group  which is run by our chief operating officer and consists of three other loan and credit administration officers  is responsible for oversight of problem assets and increases the frequency with which criticized and classified credits are reviewed and aggressively acts to resolve problem loans 

table of contents when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late notice is generated and sent to the borrower 
a second notice is sent and phone calls are made ten days later 
if payment is not received by the th day of delinquency  a further notification is sent to the borrower 
if payment is not received by the th day of delinquency for a loan on a pennsylvania property or the th day of delinquency for a loan on a new jersey property  a notice is sent to the borrower advising them that they have a specified period of time to cure their default before legal action begins 
if no successful workout can be achieved  after a loan becomes days delinquent  we typically commence foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at or subsequent to foreclosure 
we also may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances 
management reports to the board of directors or a committee of the board monthly regarding the status of nonperforming loans  assets acquired through foreclosure  troubled debt restructurings  loans delinquent more than days and any other loans requiring special attention 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider assets acquired through foreclosure  loans that are days or more past due and loans that are not days past due  but where collection of principal or interest is in doubt  to be nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and any previously recorded interest is reversed and recorded as a reduction of loan interest and fee income 
generally  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal at the time received  unless collection of principal and interest in full is considered probable 
assets acquired through foreclosure consists of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors 
these assets are obtained through foreclosure  by a deed in lieu of foreclosure  in substance foreclosure or in exchange for satisfaction of debt 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
costs related to the development or improvement of an acquired property are capitalized 
holding costs and declines in carrying value after acquisition are recorded as assets acquired through foreclosure expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
financial assets acquired from debtors are carried at fair value under the fair value option in accordance with fasb asc financial instruments 
increases or decreases in fair value after acquisition are recorded as assets acquired through foreclosure expense in the consolidated statements of operations

interest income that would have been recorded for had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms was approximately million 
interest income included in net income for these loans for was  federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the 
table of contents institution is not warranted 
if we classify an asset as loss  it is recorded as a loan charged off in the current period 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as criticized assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our criticized and classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets total criticized and classified assets at december   substandard assets were comprised of million in nonaccrual loans and million of assets acquired through foreclosure identified in the nonperforming asset table  million related to five loans that are current on principal and interest payments but are classified due to weaknesses in each of the borrower underlying businesses and million in real estate held for investment 
at december   fox chase bank had eighteen loans classified as special mention  which were comprised of five multi family and commercial real estate relationships totaling million and six commercial and industrial relationships totaling million

the other million commercial real estate loan was recorded as an accruing tdr at december  and was extended during february troubled debt restructurings 
the company may  under certain circumstances  restructure loans as a concession to borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty 
troubled debt restructurings tdrs are included in impaired loans 
tdrs typically result from the company loss mitigation activities which  among other activities  could include rate reductions  payment extension  and or principal forgiveness

analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based upon management evaluation of the portfolio collectability 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when changes in the allowance are necessary  an adjustment is made 
the adjustments to the allowance are made by management and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allowance on impaired loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for losses on the entire portfolio 
allowance required for impaired loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that fox chase bank will be unable to collect future payments of principal or interest as contractually due 
fox chase bank applies its normal loan review procedures in determining if a loan is impaired  which includes reviewing the collectability of delinquent and internally classified loans on a regular basis and at least quarterly 
additionally  all loans classified as a tdr are considered impaired 
when a loan is classified as impaired  an impairment analysis is performed within the quarter in which a loan is identified as impaired to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
in measuring impairment  fox chase bank determines whether repayment is expected through cash flows from the borrower or the borrower underlying business or property 
in determining the likelihood of collecting principal and interest  the company considers all available and relevant information  including the borrower actual and projected cash flows  balance sheet strength  liquidity and overall financial position 
if repayment from the borrower or the underlying business or property is determined to be unlikely  and collateral exists  fox chase bank considers the loan to be collateral dependent 
for impaired loans that are collateral dependent  the company performs an impairment analysis in the quarter the loan is identified as impaired 
in measuring the initial amount of impairment for a collateral dependent loan  the company reviews the condition of the underlying property 
such review 
table of contents includes visiting and examining the property  reviewing the age and value of the most recent appraisal on file  reviewing the list price if the property is for sale and calculating loan to value ratios 
the company reexamines each of its impaired loans on a quarterly basis to determine if any adjustments to the net carrying amount of a loan are required 
for collateral dependent loans  the company takes into consideration current facts and circumstances in analyzing whether the fair value of the collateral has increased or decreased significantly such that a change to the corresponding valuation allowance is required 
such analysis may be based on many different sources  including  but not limited to sales values of comparable properties or units within the same development relative to the appraised values for such properties or units that occurred since the date of the last appraisal  sales agreements that may be entered into on the property since the date of the last appraisal  or offers the company receives on projects or properties since the date of the last appraisal 
if current facts and circumstances are insufficient to determine fair value  fox chase bank obtains a new appraisal 
further  the company policy is to obtain an appraisal on each impaired loan greater than  annually except in instances where management prepared discounted cash flow analysis are deemed to be an appropriate valuation method 
if the fair value of a collateral dependent loan  less costs to sell  is less than the loan carrying amount  the company establishes a provision to the allowance for loan losses in the amount of the difference between fair value  less costs to sell  and the loan carrying amount 
the company recognizes charge offs associated with impaired loans when all or a portion of a loan is considered to be uncollectible 
charge off amounts are based on appraised value  less estimated costs to sell 
for loans that are not collateral dependent  we establish a specific allowance on impaired loans based on management estimate of the discounted cash flows the company expects to receive from the borrower 
factors considered in evaluating such cash flows include the type and value of collateral  if applicable  the strength of our collateral position  if applicable  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  the borrower effort to cure the delinquency  the strength of the customer personal or business cash flows and personal guarantees  the availability of other sources of repayment  and the amount due or past due 
at december   the company had million of impaired loans comprised of million of nonaccrual loans see analysis of nonperforming and classified assets and million of tdrs see troubled debt restructurings management has recorded an allowance for loan losses on impaired loans of million at december  relating to million in impaired loans 
such allowance for loan losses is determined based on either management estimate of discounted cash flows that the company expects to receive over the life of the loan or for collateral dependent loans  appraised value less costs to sell 
at december   the company had million of impaired loans that had no related valuation allowance 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are classified  but are not considered impaired and that are not classified  to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan category and assigning percentages  known as loss factors  to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include the company loss experience by particular segments  trends in industry charge offs by particular segments  trends and absolute levels of classified and criticized loans  trends and absolute levels in delinquent loans  trends in risk ratings  and changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our lending areas and the national economy 
these loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we perform this systematic analysis of the allowance on a quarterly basis 

table of contents for commercial loan relationships originated in the last twelve months  management reviews and provides a loss factor for each individual commercial loan relationship 
generally  management believes the risk of default on recently underwritten loans is relatively low at the time of origination and increases with time  at some point moderating 
this is supported by the concept that the fair value of the loan at inception approximates its book value 
new commercial loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and allowance for loan loss factors adjusted commensurate with assessed changes in the loan risk 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans was million and the general valuation allowance for the loan portfolio was million 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans was million and the general valuation allowance for the loan portfolio was million 
the allowance for loan losses at december  and represent application of loan loss policies  which comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and all regulatory guidance 
we identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all nonperforming  delinquent and criticized loans which we have concerns about collectability 
a loan is charged off when in our judgment  the loan or portion of a loan is considered uncollectible

the office of the comptroller of the currency may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  increases may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
to reduce the volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk generally is to emphasize the origination of shorter term adjustable rate loans  and to invest in securities that have shorter term maturities 
additionally  we have focused on increasing core deposits including non interest bearing and money market deposit accounts  which provide greater pricing flexibility  as well as making efforts to extend maturities on certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings to better match longer term fixed rate assets 

table of contents we have a risk management committee  which together with an asset liability management committee  communicates  coordinates and controls all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committees establish and monitor the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
net portfolio value analysis 
we use a third party vendor prepared model  which incorporates actual data and management assumptions  to review our level of interest rate risk 
such analyses measure interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  these analyses are not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
the following table presents the change in the net portfolio value of fox chase bank at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
net portfolio value net portfolio value as of portfolio value of assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp dollars in thousands the decrease in our net portfolio value shown in the preceding table that would occur reflects that a substantial portion of our interest earning assets are fixed rate residential loans and fixed rate investment securities  the shorter duration of deposits  which reprice more frequently in response to changes in market interest rates  and the size of our mortgage related securities portfolio  which would decrease in value as interest rates increase 
the third party vendor and management use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if 
table of contents prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  short term and long term wholesale borrowings  brokered deposits  loan repayments and maturities and liquidation and sales of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and sales of securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
we use a variety of measures to assess our liquidity needs  which are provided to our asset liability management committee on a regular basis 
our policy is to maintain net liquidity of at least of our funding obligations over the next month 
additionally  our policy is to maintain an amount of cash and short term marketable securities equal to at least of net deposits and liabilities that will mature in one year or less 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  of which we had million outstanding 
at december   we had million in unfunded loan commitments outstanding  which consisted of million in home equity and consumer loan commitments and million in commercial loan commitments 
additionally  we had million in standby letters of credit and  in commercial letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  including million of brokered deposits  representing of total certificates of deposit at december  we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflect customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment as well as the company use of shorter term brokered deposits 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years in thousands operating lease obligations fhlb advances and other borrowings other long term obligations total represents lease obligations for fox chase bank operations center and one commercial loan production office

capital management 
we have managed our capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision regulation of federal banking regulation capital requirements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments  letters of credit and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements the information required by this item is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than do general levels of inflation
