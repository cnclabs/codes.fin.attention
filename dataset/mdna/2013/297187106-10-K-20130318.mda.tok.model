overview history essex rental corp 
formerly  hyde park acquisition corp 
was incorporated in delaware on august  as a blank check company whose objective was to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
we consummated our initial public offering on march  all activity from august  inception through march  relates to our formation and initial public offering 
from march  through october   our activities were limited to identifying prospective target businesses to acquire and complete a business combination 
on october   we consummated the acquisition of holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary  essex crane  and  as a result  we are no longer in the development stage 
in august  we formed a new subsidiary  essex finance corp  to facilitate the acquisition of rental equipment 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of coast liquidating co 
formerly known as coast crane company through a newly formed subsidiary cc bidding corp  which subsequently changed its name to coast crane company 
the assets acquired in the coast acquisition consisted of all of the assets used in the operation of coast liquidating co 
s specialty lifting solutions and crane rental services business  including cranes and related heavy lifting machinery and equipment and spare parts  inventory  accounts receivable  rights under executory contracts  other tangible and intangible assets and all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of coast crane ltd  a british columbia corporation  through which coast liquidating co 
conducted its operations in canada 
business through our operating subsidiaries  essex crane and coast crane  we are one of north america largest providers of lifting equipment including lattice boom crawler cranes  truck cranes and rough terrain cranes  tower cranes  and other lifting equipment used in a wide array of construction projects 
in addition  we provide product support including installation  maintenance  repair  and parts and services for our equipment provided to customers and customer owned equipment 
with a large fleet of cranes and other construction equipment and customer service and support  we supply a wide variety of innovative lifting solutions for construction projects related to power generation  petro chemical  refineries  water treatment and purification  bridges  highways  hospitals  shipbuilding  offshore oil fabrication and industrial plants  and commercial and residential construction 
we rent our equipment bare  meaning without supplying an operator and  in exchange for a fee  make arrangements for the transportation and delivery of our equipment 
once the crane is delivered and erected on the customer s site  inspected and determined to be operating properly by the customer s crane operator and management  most of the maintenance and repair costs are the responsibility of the customer while the equipment is on rent 
this business model allows us to minimize our headcount and operating costs including reduced liability related to operator error and provides the customer with a more flexible situation where they control the crane and the operator s work schedule 
over the past several years  we have been focused on reinvesting capital into our rental fleet 
specifically  we have sold lower lifting capacity cranes and other heavy lifting equipment for better utilized heavier lifting capacity cranes 
during the years ended december      and the company invested on a gross basis excluding the proceeds received from rental equipment sales approximately million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively  into new cranes and attachments for our rental fleet 
the company rental fleet investment for the years ended december    and primarily consisted of crawler cranes while the rental fleet investment for the years ended december  and primarily consisted of rough terrain cranes  tower cranes and mantis crawler cranes 
these investment decisions contributed greatly to the repositioning our fleet to maximize its utilization rates and average rental rates 
although we believe the repositioning of the fleet has maximized utilization rates and average rental rates  the economic downturn has significantly adversely impacted our business activity levels 
the following table provides a summary of utilization rates calculated using the days method for the years ended december   and 
table of contents for the years ended december  crawler cranes rough terrain cranes n a boomtrucks n a self erecting tower cranes n a city and other tower cranes n a forklifts and other equipment n a utilization rates for categories other than crawler cranes is not meaningful due to the timing of the coast acquisition in late november includes the impact of a increase in the number of units available for rent for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
includes the impact of a decrease in the number of units available for rent for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the reduction in the number of units available for rent reflects the company strategic decision to sell equipment within this asset class that is not part of our core strategy and does not leverage our crane expertise 
adjusted ebitda to net income reconciliation adjusted ebitda represents the sum of net income  tax benefit  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  interest expense  other income  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is used internally when evaluating our operating performance and  we believe  allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time  as well as with those of other similar companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda  when viewed with the company results under gaap and the accompanying reconciliation  provides useful information about operating performance and period over period growth  and provides additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of operating performance

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the purposes of this document are based upon our audited consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results  however  may materially differ from the calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in its current operations 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our audited financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain accounting policies may be viewed as critical to us 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the financial statements and results of operations and that require our management s most subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
our management believes the policies that fall within this category are policies related to revenue recognition  rental equipment  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  derivative financial instruments and income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including multiple element arrangements  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance 
we generate revenue from the rental of cranes and related equipment and other services such as crane and equipment transportation and repairs and maintenance 
in many instances  the company provides some of the above services under the terms of a single customer equipment rental agreement 
the company also generates revenue from the retail sale of equipment and spare parts and repair and maintenance service provided with respect to non rental equipment 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the company is able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of selling price related to rental revenues after analysis of rental agreements absent any additional services offered by the company 
the company uses the estimated selling price for allocation of consideration to transportation services based on the costs associated with providing such services in addition to other supply and demand factors within specific sub markets 
the estimated selling prices of the individual deliverables are not materially different than the terms of the equipment rental agreements 

table of contents revenue from equipment rentals are billed monthly in advance and recognized as earned  on a straight line basis over the rental period specified in the associated equipment rental agreement 
rental contract terms span several months or longer 
because the term of the contracts can extend across financial reporting periods  when rentals are billed in advance  we defer recognition of revenue and record unearned rental revenue at the end of reporting periods so that rental revenue is included in the appropriate period 
repair service revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
transportation revenue from rental equipment delivery service is recognized for the drop off of rental equipment on the delivery date and is recognized for pick up when the equipment is returned to the essex service center  storage yard or next customer location 
new and used rental equipment and part sales are recognized upon acceptance by the customer and when delivery has occurred 
revenue from repair and maintenance services provided with respect to non rental equipment is recognized when the service is provided 
there are estimates required in recording certain repair and maintenance revenues and also in recording any allowances for doubtful accounts 
the estimates have historically been accurate in all material respects and we do not anticipate any material changes to our current estimates in these areas 
useful lives of rental equipment essex s primary assets consist of its lattice boom crawler cranes and attachments  rough terrain cranes  tower cranes  boom trucks and other equipment within its fleet  which are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of essex crane and coast crane  essex recorded all of its crane and attachment and other construction equipment fleet values at fair value 
essex depreciates the existing fleet over periods between and years on a straight line basis 
new cranes to the fleet are depreciated over a to year useful life while used cranes acquired will be amortized over a period of to years 
essex s management reviews the value of its crane fleet annually in conjunction with its lenders 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memos 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in accounts receivable and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts and balances are written off against the allowance when management believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase or decrease its allowance 
income taxes the company uses an asset and liability approach  as required by the applicable accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be realized 
the effect on net deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the change in tax rates is enacted 
management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex rental s tax provision in a subsequent period 
management assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company will increase its provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be recovered 
the company follows the applicable accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company files income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in most state jurisdictions 
the company is subject to us federal or state income tax examinations for years through and coast crane ltd 
is subject to canadian income tax examinations for the tax years through essex s management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred 
table of contents income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex s tax provision in a subsequent period 
at december   the company had unused us federal net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that begin expiring in at december   the company also had unused state net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that expire between and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
as part of an ongoing review of the valuation of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets  the company assesses the carrying value of these assets if such facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
losses related to long lived assets are recorded where indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset rental and associated revenues less related operating expenses plus any terminal value are less than the assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the assets will not be recoverable  as determined by the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to fair value 
we did not identify any indicators of potential impairment during the year ended december  goodwill and other intangible assets under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually  or more frequently if triggering events occur or other impairment indicators arise which might impair recoverability 
to determine if there is any impairment  management determined whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then the implied fair value of goodwill must be estimated and compared to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
we determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired as of december  derivative financial instruments essex uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its revolving credit facility with the objective of converting a targeted amount of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes  and therefore holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
essex believes that the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps is an important tool to manage its balance sheet liabilities and interest rate risk  while protecting its associated rental margins 
the company sets its equipment rental rates based in part as a percentage of the investment cost of the equipment and then uses the interest rate swap to lock in the associated interest costs of a period of time 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements please refer to note within our notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the fact that interest on our revolving credit facilities is calculated based upon either libor or prime rate plus an applicable margin as of december  the weighted average interest rate in effect on all of the company s borrowings at december  was 
a increase in the effective interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings including our short term debt obligations at december  would increase our interest expense by approximately million on an annualized basis 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying values based on their nature and terms 
the fair value of the company s total debt outstanding as of december  was million 
if market rates of interest increased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a increase from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
if market rates 
table of contents of interest decreased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a decrease from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
theses analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in the overall economy that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and  therefore  the company cannot predict its exposure to market risk 
consequently  further results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
