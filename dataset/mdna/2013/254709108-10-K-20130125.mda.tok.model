change in fiscal year on december   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from november to december of each year 
the fiscal year change is effective beginning with our fiscal year  which began on january  and will end on december  as a result of the change  we will have a december fiscal month transition period  the results of which we will separately report in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending march  and in our annual report on form k for the year ending december  change in accounting principle related to off balance sheet securitizations beginning with the first quarter of  we have included the trusts used in our securitization activities in our consolidated financial results in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

codified under the fasb accounting standards codification asc section  transfers and servicing and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to fasb interpretations no 
r statement no 
codified under asc section  consolidation  which were effective for us on december   the beginning of our fiscal year 
under statement no 
 the trusts used in our securitization transactions are no longer exempt from consolidation 
statement no 
prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated in our financial statements 
based on our assessment  we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent the trusts and accordingly  we began consolidating the trusts on december  using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by statement no 
 we recorded a billion increase in total assets  a billion increase in total liabilities and a billion decrease in stockholders equity comprised of a billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of billion in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the significant adjustments to our statement of financial condition upon adoption of statements no 
and are outlined below consolidation of billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors  
table of contents reclassification of billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables  recording of a billion allowance for loan losses  not previously required under gaap  for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables  derecognition of the remaining billion value of the interest only strip receivable  net of tax  recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash  loan receivables and other assets  and recording of net deferred tax assets of billion  largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables 
beginning with the first quarter of  our results of operations no longer reflect securitization income  but instead report interest income  net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt 
additionally  we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment 
also  there are no gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities 
notwithstanding this accounting treatment  our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from discover bank  and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts  even in insolvency  receivership or conservatorship proceedings 
we do  however  continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts

we began offering residential mortgage loans through discover home loans following our acquisition in june of substantially all of the operating and related assets of home loan center  a subsidiary of tree 
com  inc payment services continued to produce strong results with pretax income of million  up over the prior year 
transaction volume for the segment was billion  an increase of over the prior year 
we repurchased million shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock for billion 
our capital market activities included issuances of approximately billion in public credit card asset backed securitizations and a million preferred stock issuance 
we also completed two private debt exchange offers involving an aggregate million of outstanding debt 
and highlights in december  we acquired slc  which added approximately billion of private student loans to our portfolio  and in september  we acquired approximately billion of private student loans from citi 
our revenues were unfavorably impacted in and by the implementation of certain provisions of the card act  which included limitations on our ability to reprice accounts  the elimination of overlimit fees and a reduction in the amount of standard late fees 
we settled our antitrust litigation with visa and mastercard for billion in for the years ended november  and  we received a total of billion billion after tax and billion billion after tax  respectively  from visa for its portion of the settlement 
at the time of our spin off  we entered into an agreement with morgan stanley to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared  among other things 
in  we paid morgan stanley a dividend of million under an amendment to that agreement 
recent developments on december   we changed our fiscal year end from november to december see change in fiscal year above for more information 
on december   we paid a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding  shares of fixed rate non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  in the amount of per share 
the dividend equaled per depositary share  representing a th interest in a share of the preferred stock 
the dividend covered the period from the issuance of the stock on october  through november  on january   we paid a cash dividend of per share of our common stock  which was an increase from the per share dividend that we paid in the previous quarter 
on january   we announced the declaration of the first full quarterly cash dividend on our preferred stock referenced above in the amount of per share  equal to 
per depositary share  to be paid on march  to holders of record on february  outlook credit performance continued to improve through as we reached historical lows in net charge off rates 
reserve releases contributed to our overall profitability  but we do not expect to receive a similar benefit of reserve releases in we believe investments in marketing contributed to our receivables growth and  heading into  we are focused on continuing this trend through new account acquisitions and wallet share gains 
we are also targeting solid growth and strong returns in our private student and personal loan portfolios 
the expansion of our direct banking product offerings remains a priority and we look forward to launching online checking in early we anticipate further total yield compression in due to the continuing effects of the card act  an increase in promotional offers and expected growth in private student loans  which tend to carry lower interest rates and have lower principal charge offs than our card receivables 
we expect this yield compression to be somewhat offset by continued funding cost improvements 
funding costs are expected to continue to decline over the next year as we benefit from the interest rate 
table of contents environment and replace higher priced time deposits with lower cost borrowings 
net interest margin is expected to remain above our long term target 
as in  we intend to continue to maintain a strong capital level while targeting investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and quarterly dividends 
in our payments business  we continue to explore opportunities to leverage our network infrastructure 
in august  we entered into a service arrangement with paypal to utilize our network relationships to obtain access to the point of sale at millions of retail locations of participating merchants  which is targeted for launch in the second quarter of we also continue to invest in global brand awareness and acceptance through support of our diners club network and arrangements with other banks  networks and merchant acquirers 
we expect to see a decline in the rate of pulse transaction volume growth in as a result of actions by competitors with regard to merchant and acquirer pricing and transaction routing strategies 
we continue to monitor the political and economic situation in europe and work with our local diners club licensees with regard to their ability to maintain financing sufficient to support business operations 
the inability of certain licensees to maintain operating financing could adversely impact our payment services business 
from time to time  we provide financial assistance to licensees when we deem it beneficial to our global payments strategy 
for example  we have provided loans to certain licensees and we recently entered into an agreement to purchase one of our licensees 
such arrangements may cause us to incur financial losses 
regulatory environment and developments the reform act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets 
the reform act addresses risks to the economy and the payments system posed by large systemically significant financial firms  including us  through a variety of measures  including increased capital and liquidity requirements  limits on leverage  and enhanced supervisory authority 
the reform act also established a new financial industry regulator  the cfpb  and new requirements for debit card transactions  which impact our core businesses 
additional legislative or regulatory action that may impact our business may result from the multiple studies mandated under the reform act 
the evolving regulatory environment causes uncertainty with respect to the manner in which we conduct our businesses and may potentially increase the risk that we may be subject to criticism by our banking regulators 
our banking regulators have introduced and continue to introduce new regulations  supervisory guidance and enforcement actions 
we are unable to predict the nature  extent or impact of any additional changes to statutes or regulations  including the interpretation  implementation or enforcement thereof  which may occur in the future 
the impact that the regulatory environment ultimately has on our business and operations depends upon final implementing regulations  the actions of our competitors and the behavior of consumers and other marketplace participants 
regulatory actions could require us to limit or change our business practices  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  limit our product offerings  require continued investment of management time and resources in compliance efforts  limit fees we can charge for services  require us to meet more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements including those under basel iii  increase costs  restrict our ability to access the securitization markets for our funding  impact the value of our assets  or otherwise adversely affect our businesses 
to date  compliance requirements and expenditures have increased for financial services firms  including discover  and we expect them to continue to increase 
in september  discover bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and cfpb with respect to the marketing of our protection products  which required us to provide refunds of approximately million to eligible customers  pay a million civil monetary penalty and enhance our business processes 
we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we enter into new lines of business or new business arrangements with third party service providers  alternative payment providers or other industry participants  including providers or participants that may not be regulated financial institutions 
the additional expense  time and resources needed to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

table of contents consumer financial services the reform act established the cfpb  which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers  including discover 
the cfpb is authorized to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive acts or practices and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair  transparent and competitive 
the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the reform act and other federal consumer financial services laws  as well as broad supervisory  examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services  such as discover 
in addition  the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to the products we offer 
the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory  enforcement or examination focus 
although the cfpb has begun to implement its regulatory  supervisory  examination and enforcement authority  there continues to be significant uncertainty as to how the agency strategies and priorities will impact our businesses 
the cfpb has recently focused on the marketing of protection products 
in september  discover bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and cfpb with respect to the marketing of our protection products  as referenced above 
student loans 
there is significant legislative and regulatory focus on the student loan market  including by the cfpb  which has made it a priority area of focus 
the reform act created a private education ombudsman within the cfpb to receive and attempt to informally resolve complaints about private student loans  and the ombudsman issued a report in october summarizing the complaints that have been received 
the october report recommended that congressional committees identify opportunities to spur the availability of loan modification and refinance options for student loan borrowers 
in addition  the report recommends that the cfpb and other regulatory agencies assess whether efforts to correct problems in mortgage servicing could be applied to improve the quality of student loan servicing 
in july  the cfpb and the us department of education released a comprehensive report on private student lending  which recommended that congress re assess the current bankruptcy exemption for private student loans 
the july report also recommends that congress consider requiring private student lenders to obtain school certification that the amount of a student loan does not exceed student need  that more and better information about post graduate outcomes be made available to students  lenders  and regulators in order to inform students choice of school and lenders underwriting capabilities  that schools should determine whether students have exhausted federal aid and certify the need for a private student loan  and that private lenders should disclose the availability of federal aid 
additionally  as directed by the reform act  the cfpb reviewed the use of schools cohort default rates in private loan underwriting 
the cohort default rate for each school is the average rate of default on federal loans by all student borrowers attending that school  measured for each school year and published by the department of education 
the july report concluded that the general reliance of many private student lenders on cohort default rates for eligibility cutoffs for students at specific schools may raise a threshold fair lending concern  meriting further analysis by private student lenders to provide evidence of business need 
like other private student lenders  we utilize cohort default rates in the determination of eligibility  and we have reviewed our business needs supporting their use 
congress or the administration may take actions as a result of these studies  or otherwise  that impact the student loan market in the future 
legislation has been proposed in past congresses that would make it easier to discharge private student loan debt in bankruptcy  by repealing the current requirement that this relief is available only to those for whom repaying such loans would be an undue hardship 
it is uncertain whether this legislation will be proposed again in and whether it will pass 
even if such legislation passed congress  we believe our underwriting practices and the high percentage of our loans that have cosigners reduce potential risk to our business 
any such actions  however  could cause us to restructure our private student loan product in ways that we may not currently anticipate 
home loans 
the cfpb has indicated that the mortgage industry is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examinations and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage related topics required under the reform act including steering consumers to less favorable products  discrimination  abusive or unfair lending practices  predatory lending  origination disclosures  minimum mortgage underwriting standards  mortgage loan origination compensation and servicing practices 
the cfpb recently published several final rules impacting the mortgage industry  including rules related to ability to repay  mortgage servicing and mortgage loan originator compensation 
the ability to repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test but also creates a safe harbor for so called qualified mortgages 
the qualified mortgages standards include a tiered cap structure that places limits on the total amount of certain fees that can be charged on a loan  a cap on debt to income ie  total monthly payments on debt to monthly gross income  exclusion of interest only products and other requirements 
the debt to income cap does not apply for the first seven years the rule is in effect for loans that are eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac or eligible for government guarantee through the fha or the veterans administration 
failure to comply with the ability to repay rule may result in possible cfpb enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual  class action and attorney fee damages  all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time 
we are currently assessing the impact of these requirements on our mortgage business 
it is uncertain what the impact of these requirements will be on the secondary market into which we sell mortgages we originate 

table of contents in addition  the federal reserve and other federal agencies have issued a proposed rule under the reform act that would exempt qualified residential mortgages from the reform act requirement that the securitizer of assets retain an economic interest in a portion of the assets 
the final definition of what constitutes a qualified residential mortgage may impact the pricing and depth of the secondary mortgage market 
at this time  we cannot predict the final content of proposed rules issued by the regulatory agencies or the impacts they might have on our business practices or financial results 
future regulatory initiatives that could significantly affect the mortgage industry include proposals to reform the housing finance market in the united states 
these proposals  among other things  consider winding down the government sponsored enterprises  fannie mae and freddie mac collectively  the gses 
in addition  the fha may take action to further restrict the availability of fha loan products in order to shrink the fha s presence in the mortgage market 
the extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the adoption of any legislation regarding the gses  changes to the fha mortgage product  and or the home mortgage market  as well as any effect on our business and financial results  are uncertain at this time 
payment networks following the implementation of the federal reserve regulations related to debit routing and fees in october and april  large competing networks began to implement new merchant and acquirer pricing and transaction routing strategies 
we are closely monitoring the implementation of these strategies in order to assess their impact on our business and on competition in the marketplace 
the us department of justice is examining some of these competitor pricing strategies 
while we are still assessing all of our options for responding to these developments  we currently expect that they will adversely impact pulse ability to compete for issuer participation and merchant and acquirer routing  resulting in fewer debit transactions being routed to pulse and a decline in the rate of pulse transaction volume growth 
capital in june  the federal reserve approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to us and discover bank 
the fdic and the occ subsequently approved these proposed rules 
the proposed rules implement basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the reform act 
basel iii refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements 
the proposed rules received extensive comments 
in a joint press release issued in november  the agencies stated that they do not expect any of the proposed rules to become effective on the original target date of january  industry participants are expecting further guidance in early in october  the federal reserve issued final rules implementing the stress test requirements under the reform act for bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets  including discover 
under the final rule  the federal reserve will conduct annual supervisory stress tests for the bank holding companies that participated in the supervisory capital assessment program and subsequent comprehensive capital analysis and reviews ccar bhcs and will publish the results of such stress tests in march each year  beginning in in addition  the ccar bhcs will be required to conduct their own stress tests twice per year and publish the results of these company run stress tests in march and september each year  beginning in however  the federal reserve delayed implementation of these requirements for bank holding companies like discover that have billion or more in total consolidated assets  but are not ccar bhcs  for one year 
in october  the fdic also issued final rules implementing the stress test requirements under the reform act for state nonmember banks with billion or more in total consolidated assets  like our subsidiary  discover bank 
the fdic stress test rule is similar to the federal reserve stress test rule  except that in general it requires large banks like discover bank to comply with stress test requirements under the same timeline as required for the ccar bhcs 
however  the fdic reserved authority in the final rule to permit subsidiary banks of non ccar bhcs  such as discover bank  to delay the application of the requirements of the final rule on a case by case basis 
we sought and obtained fdic approval to delay the application of certain stress test requirements to discover bank to align with the federal reserve stress test requirements that apply to us 
in this regard  discover bank will not be required to comply with the requirements for the publication of stress test results until

furthermore  discount and interchange revenue and revenue from protection products increased during the year ended november  as compared to the same period in these increases were partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as well as a modest loss on investments 
the increase in discount and interchange revenue was driven by higher sales volume  partially offset by higher cashback bonus rewards 
higher levels of revenue from protection products were driven by lower charge offs relating to these products during the year ended november  as compared to the same period in gain on investments declined for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in due to the inclusion of a gain of million related to the liquidation of the collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of golden key us llc golden key during there was not a similar benefit recognized in furthermore  other income in also included a million charge related to the decision we made in to sell our remaining federal student loans

for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity  it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period 
for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions  significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain cases  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses  the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost  the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  the accrual of income taxes  estimates of future cash flows associated with purchased credit impaired loans  and the fair value estimates of loan commitments and mortgages held for sale as critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses we base our allowance for loan loss on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date 
while our estimation process includes historical data and analysis  there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance 
we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables 
management also estimates loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts 
the considerations in these analyses include past performance  risk management techniques applied to various accounts  historical behavior of different account vintages  current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies  bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates  and forecasting uncertainties 
given the same information  others may reach different reasonable estimates 
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses  the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a change in management estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at november   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses 
see loan quality and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses 
customer rewards cost we offer our customers various reward programs  including the cashback bonus reward program pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customer purchases 
the liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity or other defined actions 
the liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards 
in determining the forfeiture estimate  we consider historical rewards redemption and forfeiture behavior  the level of recent customer purchase activity and the terms of the current rewards programs 
we generally recognize reward costs as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
if management used a different estimate of forfeitures  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed 
for example  a basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of november  could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately million 
the corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue 
see other income and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about customer rewards cost 

table of contents goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets 
in addition  we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the diners club business 
as required by gaap  we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  management must estimate the fair value of the business unit s to which the goodwill relates 
because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable  other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses 
similarly  in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment  management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models 
in applying these techniques  management considers historical results  business forecasts  market and industry conditions and other factors 
we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques 
the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance  revenue and expense growth  discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature 
if economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations  we may be exposed to an impairment loss that  when recognized  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
at november   based on the annual impairment testing performed  there was no impairment recorded on any reporting unit or intangible asset 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations  primarily the united states  its states and municipalities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes  interpretations of tax laws  the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken 
when such changes occur  the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
purchased credit impaired loans the estimate of expected future cash flows on purchased credit impaired pci loans determines the amount of yield we can recognize in future periods and impacts whether a loan loss reserve must be established for these loans 
we re evaluate the amount and timing of expected cash flows quarterly using updated loan portfolio characteristics as well as assumptions regarding expected borrower default and prepayment behavior 
because estimates of expected future cash flows on pci loans involve assumptions and significant judgment  it is reasonably possible that others could derive different estimates than ours for the same periods 
in addition  changes in estimates from one period to the next can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
a decrease in expected cash flows involving an increase in estimated credit losses would result in an immediate charge to earnings for the recognition of a loan loss provision 
increases or decreases in expected cash flows related solely to changes in estimated prepayments or to changes in variable interest rate indices would result in prospective yield adjustments over the remaining life of the loans 
an increase in expected cash flows due to a reduction in expected credit losses would result first in the reversal of any previously established loan loss reserve on pci loans through an immediate credit to earnings and then  if needed  a prospective adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the loans 
if management used a different estimate of expected borrower defaults  our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed 
for example  a increase in the expected borrower default rate of each pci loan pool as of november  could have resulted in an impairment of up to million 
this impairment would have been reflected as an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in the carrying value of the pci loans 
the accounting and estimates used in our calculations are discussed further in note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments and mortgages held for sale following our acquisition of the home loan center mortgage business in the third quarter of  we determined the fair value estimates related to our accounting for loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale to be critical accounting estimates 
we enter into commitments with consumers to originate mortgage loans at a specified interest rate  known as interest rate lock commitments irlcs 
we carry irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale on our consolidated statements of 
table of contents financial condition at their estimated fair values 
fair values for each of these instruments are estimated using quantitative risk models 
valuations of irlcs for loans to be sold to investors on a mandatory or assignment of trade delivery method are based on valuations for similar underlying loans by reference to the to be announced mortgage backed securities tba mbs market  which is actively quoted and easily validated through external sources 
the data inputs used in these valuations include  but are not limited to  loan type  underlying loan amount  note rate  loan program  and expected sale date of the loan 
irlcs for loans to be sold to investors on a best efforts basis derive their base value from the value of the underlying loans using investor pricing tables stratified by product  note rate and term  adjusted for current market conditions 
these valuations are adjusted at the loan level to consider the servicing release premium and loan pricing adjustments specific to each loan 
for all irlcs  the base value is then adjusted for the anticipated loan funding probability  or pull through rate 
the anticipated loan funding probability is an unobservable input that is based on historical experience 
a decrease in the pull through rate assumption would result in a million decrease in the value of irlcs whereas a increase in the pull through rate assumption would result in a million increase in the value of the irlcs as of november  valuations of mortgage loans held for sale are based on the loan amount  note rate  loan program  expected sale date of the loan and  most significantly  investor pricing tables stratified by product  note rate and term  adjusted for current market conditions 
in periods of normal market activity  sufficient market data is available to value these loans 
however  in illiquid markets  greater variability in pricing data could occur 
in such instances  meaningfully different valuations could be derived for the same pool of loans 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of mortgage loans held for sale would result in an immediate charge to earnings for the fair value adjustment

net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets 
we analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interest bearing assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets 
we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources  along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio  on net interest income 
our interest earning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents  which includes amounts on deposit with the federal reserve  highly rated certificates of deposit  and triple a rated government mutual funds  ii restricted cash  iii short term investments  iv investment securities and v loan receivables 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits  
table of contents both direct to consumer and brokered  and long term borrowings  including amounts owed to securitization investors 
net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables  including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans  as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates  the credit performance of our loans  particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges  which reduce interest income  the terms of long term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering  including maturity and interest rate  the level and composition of other interest bearing assets and liabilities  including our liquidity portfolio  changes in the interest rate environment  including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices  such as the prime rate  the federal funds rate and libor  the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program  and the difference between the carrying amount and future cash flows expected to be collected on pci loans 
for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest margin increased for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to improved funding rates on our deposit products  partially offset by lower yields on credit cards and growth in private student loans  which have lower yields as compared to other products 
interest income increased during the year ended november   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher interest income across all of our loan products 
the increase in interest income on credit card loans was driven by higher average levels of loans and lower interest charge offs  offset in part by a decline in yield 
the decrease in yield was due to the combination of higher levels of loans being offered at a promotional rate  as well as the receivable repricing restrictions under the card act 
the increase in interest income on private student loans was due to organic growth in our student loan receivables 
interest income on our pci student loans increased due to the acquisition of additional pci private student loans on september  see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a decrease in yield due to the lower yield on the acquired pci student loans 
interest income on personal loans also increased due to growth in the portfolio  combined with an increase in the yield 
interest income on other interest earning assets  which largely relates to investment income on our liquidity portfolio  increased during the year ended november   primarily due a continued shift in the mix of our liquidity portfolio to higher yielding investments  and higher average levels of liquidity 
interest expense declined in the year ended november   as compared to  primarily due to deposits bearing higher interest rates maturing and being replaced by deposits bearing lower interest rates 
for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  net interest margin rose slightly for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in this was driven by an increase in yield on our liquidity portfolio  as well as a decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total loans  partially offset by a decline in yield related to loans 
interest income on loan receivables increased during the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november   as an increase in interest income from other loans was partially offset by a decline in interest income from credit card loans 
the increase in interest income from other loans for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of slc during the first quarter of  as well as growth in personal loans 
for the year ended november   the decline in interest income from credit card loans was mostly driven by a decline in yield caused by an increase in promotional rate balances and a decrease in customers who carry a balance on their cards  partially offset by lower interest charge offs 
furthermore  the decline in yield was also impacted by the card act that was implemented in  which led to restrictions on imposing default interest rates on existing balances 
interest income on other interest earning assets  which largely relates to investment income on our liquidity investment portfolio  increased primarily due to a shift in the mix of our liquidity investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of from cash and cash equivalents to investments in securities of the u 
s treasury and us government agencies  which typically have a higher yield than cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense declined in the year ended november  as compared to the same period in this was primarily due to a decline in interest expense related to maturities of deposits bearing higher interest rates 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on securitized borrowings  primarily due to the acquisition of three slc securitization trusts in the first quarter of  which have higher funding costs than our credit card securitizations

provision and allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date 
factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer  including unemployment levels  bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  changes in our loan portfolio  including the overall mix of accounts  products and loan balances within the portfolio  the level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs  the credit quality of the loan portfolio  which reflects  among other factors  our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts  and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance 
in calculating the allowance for loan losses  we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics  such as credit card and other loans 
we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency 
we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts which adds an additional element to the identification of loss emergence 
we use these analyses together as a basis for determining our allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan loss was billion at november   which reflects a million reserve release over the amount of the allowance for loan loss at november  the reserve release  which primarily related to credit card 
table of contents loan receivables  was driven by favorability in credit performance of the portfolio and a continuation of a declining trend in net charge offs 
at november   the allowance for loan loss was billion  which reflects a billion reserve release over the amount of the allowance for loan loss at november  the reserve release was driven by improved credit performance and a sharp decrease in net charge offs 
the provision for loan loss is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net charge offs in the period and the required amount of allowance for loan loss at the balance sheet date 
for the year ended november   the reduction in reserve requirements as described above led to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of million  or  as compared to the year ended november  for the year ended november   the provision decreased billion  or 
for the year ended november   the provision decreased billion 
at november   the level of the allowance related to personal loans increased by million as compared to november   primarily driven by growth in receivables as the reserve for these loans is relatively consistent as a percent of the related outstanding loan balance 
the increase in the allowance attributable to student loans for the same period was driven both by the seasoning of the portfolio and by new loan originations 
seasoning refers to both the maturing of a loan portfolio as  in general  loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been in repayment for some period of time  as well as loan movement through the deferment period as students near graduation 
for student loans  payments are not required while the borrower is still in school  therefore  this loan portfolio matures at a slower pace 
at november   the allowance related to personal loans increased by million as compared to november  at november   the allowance related to student loans increased by million as compared to november   primarily due to the increase in private student loan receivables as well as the seasoning of the loan portfolio

net charge offs our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees  recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses 
charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income  respectively  which is effectively a reclassification of the loan loss provision  while fraud losses are recorded in other expense

see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the accounting for charge offs on pci loans 
the net charge off rate on our credit card loan receivables decreased basis points for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  the decrease in net charge offs was attributable to an overall improvement in credit quality 
net charge offs for private student loans increased slightly from prior year due to the seasoning of the portfolio as well as more loans entering repayment 
the net charge off rate on our credit card loan receivables decreased basis points for the year ended november  as compared to the year ended november  the decrease in net charge offs was attributable to improvement in both contractual and bankruptcy related charge offs subsequent to a peak in the level of charge offs in the first quarter of furthermore  during the year ended november   there were higher levels of recoveries as compared to the same periods in as relatively few newly originated student loans had entered repayment in  the net charge off rate on student loans remained low in similar to the prior year

since a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and aggregate expectation of cash flows  the past due status of a pool  or that of the individual loans within a pool  is not meaningful

restructured loans include million for the year ended november  that are also included in loans over days delinquent or more 
both credit card and personal loan receivables delinquency rates at november  decreased as compared to november  due to improvements in customer credit quality  which has resulted in improvements in both over day and over day delinquency balances 
conversely  the delinquency rates for private student loan balances at november  increased as compared to november  due to the seasoning of our loan portfolio and as more loans have entered repayment 
this seasoning supports the increase in both over day and over day delinquency rates 
loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of bankruptcies 
restructured credit card loans at november  increased to billion from billion at november  because we began including the modified credit card loans that reverted to pre modification payment terms in the restructured loan amount during both credit card and personal loan receivables delinquency rates at november  generally declined as compared to november  due to continued improvement in customer financial performance  which resulted in improvements in both over day and over day delinquency balances 
the decline is also attributable to proactive customer account management 
the rate for over day delinquency balances increased for private student loan balances due to the seasoning of 
table of contents our loan portfolio for the year ended november  as compared to the same period in the rate for over day delinquency balances for private student loan balances was flat for the year ended november  as compared to loan receivables not accruing interest at november  decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of bankruptcies 
restructured credit card loans at november  increased to billion from million at november  because we began accounting for credit card loans modified through temporary hardship and external programs as troubled debt restructurings during

historically  actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and  therefore  the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments 
at november   approximately billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately billion were fixed rate loans 
modified and restructured loans we have loan modification programs that provide for temporary or permanent hardship relief for our credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
the temporary hardship program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction  both lasting for a period no longer than months 
the permanent workout program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than months and reducing the interest rate on the loan 
the permanent programs do not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal  but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments 
we also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources  such as a consumer credit counseling agency program 
these loans continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal  interest or fees 
for additional information regarding the accounting treatment for these loans as well as amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these loans  see note loan receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
for student loan borrowers  in certain situations we offer payment forbearance to borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties and are willing to resume making payments 
when a delinquent borrower is granted a second forbearance period  we classify these loans as troubled debt restructurings 
for personal loan customers  in certain situations we offer various payment programs  including temporary and permanent programs 
the temporary programs normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than months with a final balloon payment required at the end of the loan term and in certain circumstances reducing the interest rate on the loan 
the permanent program involves changing the terms of the loan in order to payoff the outstanding balance over the new term for a period no longer than four years and also in certain circumstances reducing the interest rate on the loan 
the total term may not exceed nine years 
we also allow loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources  similar to our credit card customers discussed above 
payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency 
personal loans included in temporary and permanent programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings 
borrower performance after using payment programs or forbearance is monitored and we believe the programs help to prevent defaults and are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties 
we plan to continue to use payment programs and forbearance and  as a result  we expect to have additional loans classified as troubled debt restructurings in the future

liquidity and capital resources funding and liquidity we seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations 
in addition  we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile and utilize a cost effective mix of funding sources 
our primary funding sources include deposits  sourced directly from consumers or through brokers  term asset backed securitizations  private asset backed securitizations and short and long term borrowings 
funding sources deposits 
we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing  internet origination and affinity relationships direct to consumer deposits  and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits 
direct to consumer deposits include certificates of deposit  money market accounts  online savings accounts and ira certificates of deposit  while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts 
at november   we had billion of direct to consumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits 
maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to ten years  with a weighted average maturity of months 
the following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity as of november  dollars in millions total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months indeterminate certificates of deposit in amounts less than  certificates of deposit in amounts of  to less than certificates of deposit in amounts of  or greater savings deposits  including money market deposit accounts total interest bearing deposits  represents the basic insurance amount previously covered by the fdic 
effective july   the basic insurance per depositor was permanently increased to  represents deposits with no contractual maturity 
credit card securitization financing 
we use the securitization of credit card receivables as an additional source of funding 
we access the asset backed securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent  through which we issue asset backed securities both publicly and through private transactions 
we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the seller interest and subordinated security classes of dcmt and dcent 
the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
we refer to this as economic early amortization  which is based on excess spread levels 
excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period  including interest collections  fees and interchange  exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period  including interest expense  servicing fees and charged off receivables 
our excess spread previously included the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from series sd  which enhanced securities of both dcmt and dcent 
series sd matured on january   and as prescribed in amendments to the governing documents which 
table of contents became effective in january  the size of the class d note was increased 
in the event of an economic early amortization  which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a three month rolling average basis  we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received 
an early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity  and require us to utilize our available non securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources  which may or may not be available at the time 
as of november   the three month rolling average excess spread was 
another feature of our securitization structure  which is applicable only to the notes issued from dcent  is a reserve account funding requirement in which  in limited circumstances  excess cash flows generated by the transferred loan receivables are held at the trust 
this funding requirement is triggered when dcent s three month average excess spread rate decreases to below  with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels to 
see note credit card and student loan securitization activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the structures of dcmt and dcent and for tables providing information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at november  at november   we had billion of outstanding public asset backed securities including million of subordinated class b notes issued in the fourth quarter of  million of outstanding private asset backed securitizations and billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries at november  dollars in millions total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of long term borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors at november   we had capacity to issue up to billion in triple a rated asset backed securities from dcent without the issuance of additional class b or class c notes as subordination 
the triple a rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based  in part  on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic  as conservator or receiver  will not  using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts  seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization  or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution  provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap 
although the implementation of statement no 
on december   no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment  the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts  including dcmt  so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december  other legislative and regulatory developments may  however  impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future 
corporate and bank debt 
at november   we had billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding and discover bank had million in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding 
during the second quarter of  we completed a private exchange offer  resulting in the exchange of million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior notes due for the same aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due and a cash premium 
approximately million of these notes were subsequently exchanged for substantially identical notes that were registered under the securities act of we also completed a private exchange offer in the fourth quarter of  resulting in the exchange of million outstanding aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes of discover bank due for the same aggregate principal amount of new senior notes of dfs due and a cash premium 
we entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the new notes 
at november   our senior unsecured notes are comprised of a million issuance due in june  a million issuance due in july  a million issuance due in april and a million issuance due in november the senior unsecured notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade

table of contents other long term borrowings student loans 
at november   we had billion of remaining principal balance outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of the slc acquisition 
principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time 
during the first quarter of  we sold our remaining federal student loans that had been classified as held for sale as of november  as part of the sale  the liabilities associated with the funding of the loans were assumed by the buyer 
short term borrowings 
we primarily access short term borrowings through the federal funds market or through repurchase agreements 
at november   there were no outstanding federal funds or repurchase agreements 
beginning in june  we also began utilizing a million warehouse line of credit as another form of short term borrowings  which was subsequently increased to million 
this line of credit was established for the sole purpose of funding consumer residential loans as part of the addition of residential mortgage lending to our direct banking business 
the warehouse line of credit had an outstanding balance of million as of november  at november   the short term borrowing balance was million

we have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset backed securitizations to support the funding of our credit card loan receivables 
under these arrangements  we had used million of capacity and had undrawn capacity of billion at november  federal reserve 
discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
as of november   discover bank had billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged 
we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets  including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt  may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs  discover bank and the securitization trusts 
downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations  as well as potentially higher fees related to borrowings under our lines of credit 
in addition to increased funding costs  deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets 
we also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank s debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies 
because the credit rating of dfs did not meet the specified thresholds  we had posted million of collateral with our counterparties at november  discover bank credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties 
however  if discover bank s credit rating is reduced by one ratings notch  it would be required to post additional collateral  which  as of november   would have been million

table of contents liquidity we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations  fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under normal and stress conditions both at the parent company and on a consolidated basis 
in addition to the funding sources discussed above  we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our investment portfolio 
we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity 
regular liquidity stress testing and contingency funding planning is performed as part of our liquidity management process 
we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs 
these scenarios measure the liquidity position over a two year horizon by analyzing the stress on liquidity versus the ability to generate contingent liquidity 
we maintain contingent funding sources  including our liquidity portfolio  private securitizations with unused capacity and federal reserve discount window capacity  which we could utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events 
we expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during the next months by utilizing the funding sources that are currently available to us 
we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business  which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee the alco 
we seek to balance the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity  which may limit financial flexibility and be costly  with having too little liquidity that could cause financial distress 
liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco  which is chaired by our treasurer and has cross functional membership 
the alco monitors positions and determines any actions that may need to be taken 
at november   our liquidity portfolio was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality  liquid investment securities 
cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve 
investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and us government agencies and residential mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies 
these investments are considered highly liquid  and we have the ability to raise cash by utilizing repurchase agreements  pledging certain of these investments to access the secured funding markets or selling them 
the level of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions 
at november   our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion  which was million higher than the balance at november   as an increase in cash and cash equivalents to ensure adequate coverage for forward looking maturities and greater discount window capacity were partially offset by our unilateral decision to cancel our billion credit facility in december during the year ended november   the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was billion

any dividends declared on the preferred stock will be payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of per annum 
under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the fdic  the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies  we  along with discover bank  must maintain minimum levels of capital 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results 
we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance 
we maintain a substantial deferred tax asset on our balance sheet  and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels 
however  for regulatory capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income are currently limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on our projected future taxable income for that year  or ii of the amount of our tier capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk 
we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers  as well as invest in other assets and our business 
these loans and other assets earn interest  which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed 
our net interest income and  therefore  earnings  will be negatively affected if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than increases to the interest rate we owe on our borrowings 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates  loan balances or deposit account activity 
we may face higher cost alternative sources of funding as a result  which has the potential to decrease earnings 
our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the mix of variable and fixed rate assets 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve our objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or liability from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate 
see note derivatives and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity 
we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from our reporting date  we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously  simultaneously and to the same degree 
our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio 
we have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances 
at november   the majority of our credit card and student loans were at variable rates 
assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are considered to be rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index  such as federal funds or libor  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  also are considered to be rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimate that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
assuming an immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at november   we estimated that net interest income over the following month period would increase by approximately million  or 
we have not provided an estimate of any impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels ie  prime and libor and  therefore  could not materially decrease further
