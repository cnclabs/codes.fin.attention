overview we are the leader in virtualization infrastructure solutions utilized by organizations to help transform the way they build  deliver and consume information technology it resources 
our primary source of revenues is from the licensing and support of these solutions to organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries 
the benefits of our solutions to our customers include substantially lower it costs  cost effective high availability across a wide range of applications and a more automated and resilient systems infrastructure capable of responding dynamically to variable business demands 
we pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x server based computing  separating application software from the underlying hardware 
since then  we have introduced a broad and proven suite of virtualization technologies that address a range of complex it problems that include cost and operational inefficiencies  facilitating access to cloud computing capacity  business continuity  and corporate end user computing device management 
in  we articulated a vision for the software defined data center sddc  where increasingly infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service  and the control of this data center is entirely automated by software 
to further this vision  in the third quarter of  we released the vmware vcloud suite  which is the first integrated solution designed to meet the requirements of the sddc by pooling industry standard hardware and running compute  networking  storage and management functions in the data center as software defined services 
our solutions are based upon our core virtualization technology and are organized into two main product groups cloud infrastructure and management and end user computing 
the cloud infrastructure and management product group is based upon our flagship virtualization platform  vmware vsphere 
vmware vsphere not only decouples the entire software environment from its underlying hardware infrastructure but also enables the aggregation of multiple servers  storage infrastructures and networks into shared pools of resources that can be delivered dynamically  securely and reliably to applications as needed 
the cloud infrastructure and management group also encompasses the vmware vcloud suite and various cloud management solutions that are optimized to work with vsphere environments and are designed to simplify and automate management of dynamic cloud infrastructures that enable enterprises to build  manage and automate their own private clouds 
our end user computing product group has solutions designed to enable a user centric approach to personal computing  ensuring secure access to applications and data from a variety of devices and locations  and addresses the needs of it departments by delivering existing end user assets as a managed service 
we also offer cloud application platform solutions to help organizations build  run and manage enterprise applications in public  private or hybrid clouds optimized for vsphere 
in december  we launched the pivotal initiative with emc corporation emc  our majority stockholder  pursuant to which both companies plan to commit technology  people and programs 
the pivotal initiative is focused on big data and cloud application platforms 
big data  which is a primary contributor to the pace of overall data growth  refers to the large repositories of corporate and external data  including unstructured information created by new applications  social media and other web repositories 
we have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand our presence and reach various segments of the market 
we derive a significant majority of our sales from our indirect sales channel  which includes distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
sales to our channel partners often involve three tiers of distribution a distributor  a reseller and an end user customer 
our sales force works collaboratively with our channel partners to introduce them to end user customer accounts and new sales opportunities 
as we expand geographically  we expect to continue to add additional channel partners 
we expect to grow our business by building long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements elas 
elas are comprehensive volume license offerings offered both directly by us and through certain channel partners that provide for multi year maintenance and support at discounted prices 
under a typical ela  a portion of the revenues is attributed to the license revenues and the remainder is primarily attributed to software maintenance revenues 
in addition  the initial maintenance period is typically longer for elas than for other types of license sales 
elas enable us to build long term relationships with our customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions in their data centers 
elas also provide a base from which to sell additional products  such as our application platform products  our end user computing products and our cloud infrastructure and management products 
elas comprised between one quarter and one third of our overall sales during and  with the balance represented by our non ela  or transactional business 
in  our overall sales growth rate declined compared to  with the growth rate in transactional sales lower than the growth rate in elas 
in  we intend to also focus our selling and marketing efforts to improve the growth rate of our transactional business 

table of contents in january  we announced a realignment of our strategy to refocus our resources and investments in support of three growth priorities that focus on our core opportunities as a provider of virtualization technologies that simplify it infrastructure the software defined data center  the hybrid cloud and end user computing 
for the sddc  we plan to continue to invest in the development and delivery of innovations in networking  security  storage and management as we continue to roll out and enhance the features of our vcloud suite 
for the hybrid cloud we plan to focus on expanding our capabilities with our partners to deliver enterprise class cloud services that are complementary to private clouds in order to enhance our customer flexibility to run applications on and off premise  as they choose on a compatible  high quality  secure and resilient hybrid cloud platform 
for end user computing  we plan to enhance our offerings to enable a virtual workspace for both existing pc environments and emerging mobile devices in a secure enterprise environment 
we also announced a business plan to streamline our operations  subject to compliance with applicable legal obligations  to rationalize our portfolio and scale back investments in some areas of our business that we do not believe are directly related to our core growth opportunities 
the plan includes the elimination of approximately positions and personnel  which is expected to result in a charge in the range of to any such proposals in countries outside the united states will be subject to a review of efficiency  resources and performance 
additionally  we are planning an exit of certain lines of business and consolidation of facilities  which are expected to result in a charge in the range of to the plan is expected to be completed by the end of finalization of the plan will be subject to local information and consultation processes with employee representatives if required by law 
the total charge resulting from this plan is expected to be between and  with total cash expenditures associated with the plan expected to be in the range of to despite these changes  we expect our total headcount to increase during by approximately  as we continue to make key investments in support of our long term growth objectives 
our plan to exit certain lines of business resulted from an evaluation of our business in january at the end of  we had performed an impairment test and determined that the assets associated with these certain lines of business were not impaired 
we continue to see substantial market opportunities in and beyond to deliver software innovations that bring agility  efficiency and choice to our customers  while simplifying the infrastructure and it experience for them 
however  we currently expect our rate of year over year growth in both total revenues and license revenues to decline during the first half of due to several factors  including a difficult macroeconomic environment  the lack of large deals that we anticipate will close in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of and our business plan to streamline our operations  which we expect to have a short term negative impact on our revenues 
we currently expect stronger growth in the second half of versus the first half of on a year over year comparison basis 
during  we expect to continue to manage our resources prudently  while making key investments in support of our long term growth objectives 
results of operations as we operate our business in one operating segment  our revenues and operating expenses are presented and discussed at the consolidated level 
we classify our revenues into two categories  ie license revenues and services revenues 
see critical accounting policies for further information regarding the accounting for our revenues 
our current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate free cash flows to fund our expansion of industry segment share and to evolve our virtualization based products for data centers  end user devices and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions 
see non gaap financial measures for further information on free cash flows 
in evaluating our results  we also focus on operating margin excluding certain expenses which are included in our total operating expenses calculated in accordance with gaap 
the expenses excluded are stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses consisting of amortization of acquired intangible assets  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and acquisition related items 
we believe these measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
we are not currently focused on short term operating margin expansion  but rather on investing at appropriate rates to support our growth and priorities in what may be a substantially more competitive environment 

table of contents revenues our revenues in the years ended  and were as follows for the year ended december  vs 
vs 
change change change change revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services total revenues revenues united states international total revenues in both and  we saw growth in license and services revenues  and growth in the united states and internationally  as compared with their respective prior years 
license revenues license revenues in both and increased due to continued demand for our product offerings 
the increases in license revenues year over year were primarily due to growth in our cloud infrastructure and management product group  which increased in and in the cloud infrastructure and management product group is based upon our flagship virtualization platform  vsphere  and also encompasses our vcloud suite and various cloud management solutions  which are optimized to work with vsphere environments 
despite the year over year increases in license revenues  we are noting a slowing in the rate of license revenue growth both in and anticipated into we attribute this to a variety of factors  including challenges in the macroeconomic environment  both across the us and internationally in europe  as well as a slowing in the number of elas greater than that were closed towards the end of and are expected in the first half of services revenues in and  software maintenance revenues benefited from strong renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with new software license sales 
in each year presented  customers bought  on average  more than months of support and maintenance with each new license purchased  which we believe illustrates our customers commitment to vmware as a core element of their data center architecture and hybrid cloud strategy 
in and  professional services revenues increased as growth in our license sales and installed base led to additional demand for our professional services 
as we continue to invest in our partners and expand our ecosystem of third party professionals with expertise in our solutions to independently provide professional services to our customers  we do not expect our professional services revenues to constitute an increasing component of our revenue mix 
as a result of this strategy  our professional services revenue can vary based on the delivery channels used in any given period as well as the timing of engagements 
revenue growth in constant currency we invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
as a result  our total revenues are affected by changes in the value of the us dollar against these currencies 
in order to provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  management analyzes year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis 
since we operate with the us dollar as our functional currency  unearned revenues for orders booked in currencies other than the us dollar are converted into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect for the month in which each order is booked and remain at their historical rate when recognized into revenue 
we calculate constant currency on license revenues recognized during the current period that were originally booked in currencies other than us dollars by comparing the exchange rates used to recognize 
table of contents revenue in the current period against the exchange rates used to recognize revenue in the comparable period 
in  the year over year growth in license revenues measured on a constant currency basis was compared with as reported 
in  the year over year growth in license revenues measured on a constant currency basis was compared with as reported 
we do not calculate constant currency on services revenues  which include software maintenance revenues and professional services revenues 
unearned revenues our unearned revenues as of december  and december  were as follows december  unearned license revenues unearned software maintenance revenues unearned professional services revenues total unearned revenues the complexity of our unearned revenues has increased over time as a result of acquisitions  an expanded product portfolio and a broader range of pricing and packaging alternatives 
as of december   total unearned revenues increased by from december  this increase was primarily due to growth in unearned software maintenance revenues  attributable to our growing base of maintenance contracts 
as of december   of our total unearned revenues are expected to be recognized ratably 
unearned license revenues are either recognized ratably  recognized upon delivery of existing or future products or services  or will be recognized ratably upon delivery of future products or services 
future products include  in some cases  emerging products that are offered as part of product promotions where the purchaser of an existing product is entitled to receive a promotional product at no additional charge 
we regularly offer product promotions as a strategy to improve awareness of our emerging products 
to the extent promotional products have not been delivered and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value cannot be established  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product delivery obligations have been fulfilled 
increasingly  unearned license revenue may also be recognized ratably  which is generally due to a right to receive unspecified future products or a lack of vsoe of fair value on the software maintenance element of the arrangement 
at december   the ratable component represented over half of the total unearned license revenue balance 
the amount of total unearned license revenues may vary over periods due to the type and level of promotions offered  the portion of license contracts sold with a ratable recognition element  and when promotional products are delivered upon general availability 
unearned software maintenance revenues are attributable to our maintenance contracts and are recognized ratably  typically over terms from one to five years with a weighted average remaining term at december  of approximately years 
unearned professional services revenues result primarily from prepaid professional services  including training  and are recognized as the services are delivered 
we believe that our overall unearned revenue balance improves predictability of future revenues and that it is a key indicator of the health and growth of our business

our core operating expenses reflect our business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  in the table above

our operating margin on total operating expenses decreased to in from in the decrease in our operating margin in compared with primarily related to the year over year decrease in capitalized software development costs  partially offset by the year over year increase in our revenues  which outpaced the increase in our core operating expenses 
our operating margin on total operating expenses increased to in from in the increase in our operating margin in compared with primarily related to the increase in our revenues  which outpaced the increases in our expenses 
core operating expenses the following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that we focus on when evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses 
the increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses  which consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and acquisition related items 
core operating expenses increased by or in compared with and increased by or in compared with as quantified below  these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  bonuses  commissions  and recruiting and training  and which increased largely as a result of increases in headcount 
our headcount as of december  was approximately  compared with approximately  as of december  and compared with approximately  as of december  these increases in headcount were driven by strategic hiring  business growth and business acquisitions 
a portion of our core operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  marketing  and research 
table of contents and development  are denominated in foreign currencies and are thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
core operating expenses benefited by in and were negatively impacted by in as compared with their respective prior years due to the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies 
cost of license revenues our core operating expenses for cost of license revenues principally consist of the cost of fulfillment of our software and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third party providers 
the cost of fulfillment of our software includes it development efforts  personnel costs  product packaging and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products 
core operating expenses for cost of license revenues increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increases were due to increases of and in and  respectively  for it development costs 
additionally  cost of license revenues increased by and in and  respectively  primarily related to royalty and licensing costs for technology licensed from third party providers that is used in our products 
cost of services revenues our core operating expenses for cost of services revenues primarily include the costs of personnel and related overhead to deliver technical support for our products and to provide our professional services 
core operating expenses for cost of services revenues increased by or in compared with  and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses and travel and entertainment expenses of  which was largely driven by incremental growth in headcount to support increased revenues 
additionally  our third party professional services costs increased by to provide technical support and professional services primarily in connection with increased demand for services 
these increases in were partially offset by a decrease of due to the completion of certain it development projects and the positive impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies of us the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  which was largely driven by incremental growth in headcount  as well as an increase in expenses of for it development costs 
additionally  our third party professional services costs increased by to provide technical support and professional services primarily in connection with increased services revenues 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies also contributed to the overall increase in costs of services revenues 
research and development expenses our core operating expenses for research and development r d expenses include the personnel and related overhead associated with the r d of new product offerings and the enhancement of our existing software offerings 
core operating expenses for r d increased by or in compared with  and by or in compared with the increases were primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of and in and  respectively  which were primarily driven by incremental growth in headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions 
in and  facility related expenses of and  respectively  further contributed to the year over year increases 
additionally  the positive impact of from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies partially offset the increases in sales and marketing expenses our core operating expenses for sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions and related overhead associated with the sale and marketing of our license and services offerings  as well as the cost of product launches 
sales commissions are generally earned and expensed when a firm order is received from the customer and may be expensed in a period other than the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
sales and marketing expenses also include the net impact from the expenses incurred and fees generated by certain marketing initiatives  including our annual vmworld conferences in the us and europe 
core operating expenses for sales and marketing increased by or in compared with  and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  driven by incremental growth in headcount and by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes  as well as an increase of in the costs of marketing programs 
the increases in were partially offset by the positive impact of from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  driven by incremental growth in headcount and by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes 
additionally  the costs of marketing programs increased by and travel and entertainment expense increased by in support of our expanding markets and sales efforts 
the negative impact of from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies further contributed to the increase 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our core operating expenses for general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the overall business 
these expenses include the costs associated with our finance  human resources  it infrastructure and legal departments  as well as expenses related to corporate costs and initiatives and facilities costs 
core operating expenses for general and administrative increased by or in compared with  and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to employee related expenses mostly due to incremental growth in headcount 
general and administrative expenses also increased in due to an increase of in corporate expenses  including contributions to our charitable foundation 
also contributing to the increase in expenses in were equipment and depreciation expenses of to support increased headcount and it security initiatives and increased contractor costs of related to it security initiatives 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to employee related expenses primarily due to incremental growth in headcount 
stock based compensation stock based compensation in the years ended  and was as follows for the year ended december  stock based compensation  excluding amounts capitalized stock based compensation capitalized total stock based compensation expense total stock based compensation was in  in  and in  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
in and  we capitalized and  respectively  of stock based compensation to our software development projects 
no costs were capitalized in for software development projects 
the increase in total stock based compensation expenses in compared with was primarily due to an increase of for new awards issued to our existing employees  as well as an increase of for awards made to new employees joining vmware in additionally  total stock based compensation expense increased by in in connection with our acquisition of nicira in august partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of related to grants that became fully vested over the past year 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in over was primarily due to an increase of from new awards issued to our existing employees both in the second half of and the second quarter of  as well as an increase of for awards made to new employees joining vmware in these increases were partially offset by a decrease of primarily related to fully vested grants 
stock based compensation is recorded to each operating expense category based upon the function of the employee to whom the stock based compensation relates and fluctuates based upon the value and number of awards granted 
compensation philosophy varies by function  resulting in different weightings of cash incentives versus equity incentives 
as a result  functions with larger cash based components  such as sales commissions  will have comparatively lower stock based compensation than other functions 
as of december   the total unamortized fair value of our outstanding equity based awards held by our employees was  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
capitalized software development costs  net development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established  and as our business  products and go to market strategy have evolved  we have continued to evaluate when technological feasibility is established 
following the release of vsphere and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of  we determined that our go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this change in strategy  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
we expect our products to be available for general release soon after technological feasibility has been established 
given that we expect the majority of our product offerings to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with our other product offerings  the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods 
in and the fourth quarter of  all software development costs related to product offerings were expensed as incurred and were included in r d expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in and  we capitalized including of stock based 
table of contents compensation and including of stock based compensation  respectively  of costs for the development of software products 
capitalized software development costs increased by in compared with primarily due to an increase in costs associated with products that had reached technological feasibility  including vsphere the change in our go to market strategy and resulting decrease in the length of time between technological feasibility of our products and the date those products are available for general release to customers did not materially impact the amount of software development costs we capitalized in future changes in our judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or additional changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  could materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability were to increase in the future  the amount of capitalized costs would likely increase 
additionally  a transition to offering software as a service instead of via a license may also result in an increased level of software capitalization 
in  and  amortization expense from capitalized software development costs was  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization of software development costs in compared with and compared with was primarily due to both the timing of new product releases and the completion of amortization for other product releases  including different versions of vsphere 
amortization expense from capitalized software development costs is included in cost of license revenues on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in future periods  we expect our amortization expense from capitalized software development costs to decline as these costs are expected to be recorded as r d expense as incurred given our current go to market strategy 
other operating expenses other operating expenses consist of intangible amortization and employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions  which are recorded to each individual line of operating expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
additionally  other operating expenses include acquisition related items  which are recorded in general and administrative expense on our income statement 
other operating expenses in the years ended  and were as follows for the year ended december  intangible amortization employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions acquisition related items total other operating expenses other operating expenses increased in from and in from the increase in was primarily due to an increase in intangible amortization of resulting from new acquisitions  which was primarily recorded to cost of license revenues on our accompanying consolidated statement of income 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of in employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  which was attributable to a decrease in the number of awards exercised  sold or vested 
the increase in other operating expenses in was primarily due to additional intangible amortization of resulting from new acquisitions  of which was recorded to costs of license revenues on our income statement 
investment income investment income increased by to in from in and increased by to in from in investment income consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances partially offset by the amortization of premiums paid on fixed income securities 
in both and as compared with their respective prior years  investment income increased due to increased balances invested in our fixed income portfolio and higher yields 
other income expense  net other expense  net of in changed by compared with other income  net of in other income  net of in changed by from other expense  net of in the changes in compared with and in compared with were primarily due to a gain recognized on the sale of our investment in terremark worldwide  inc in 
table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was higher than primarily due to the federal research credit  which expired at the end of and was unavailable in the rate was also negatively impacted by a greater proportion of earnings in the us  which are taxed at a higher rate than our earnings in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate in was lower than primarily due to a shift in the mix of income before tax from the us to international jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the us rate  partially offset by a relative reduction in the benefit from the federal research credit 
in january  the united states congress retroactively enacted an extension of the federal research credit through december  as a result  we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of will include an estimated discrete tax benefit of approximately reflecting the full year federal research credit 
this estimated amount will be finalized in our annual estimated effective tax rate will also include the benefit expected for and accordingly  we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the effective tax rate 
our rate of taxation in foreign jurisdictions is lower than the us tax rate 
our international income is primarily earned by our subsidiaries in ireland  where the statutory tax rate is 
we do not believe that any recent or currently expected developments in non us tax jurisdictions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
all income earned abroad  except for previously taxed income for us tax purposes  is considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations and no provision for us taxes has been provided with respect to such income 
as of december   our total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were  of which  were held outside the us our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our us funds in our foreign operations  and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we plan to meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows generated from our us operations  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
if management determines these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue us taxes on the related undistributed earnings in the period management determines the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the us in order to repatriate these funds 
we have been included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and expect to continue to be included in such consolidated group for periods in which emc owns at least of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock as calculated for us federal income tax purposes 
the percentage of voting power and value calculated for us federal income tax purposes may differ from the percentage of outstanding shares beneficially owned by emc due to the greater voting power of our class b common stock as compared to our class a common stock and other factors 
each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon 
should emc ownership fall below of the total voting power or value of our outstanding stock in any period  then we would no longer be included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and thus we would no longer be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred  but not discharged  by any other member of the emc consolidated group 
additionally  our us federal income tax would be reported separately from that of the emc consolidated group 
although we file a federal consolidated tax return with emc  we calculate our income tax provision on a stand alone basis 
our effective tax rate in the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the rate at which the provision for income taxes is calculated differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions where income is earned and considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  changes in our business  regulations  or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  changes in our international organization  shifts in the amount of income before tax earned in the us as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
our relationship with emc as of december   emc owned  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock  representing of our total outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to an ongoing reseller arrangement with emc  emc bundles our products and services with emc s products and sells them to end users 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues of  and  respectively  from such contractual arrangement with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from products and services sold under the reseller arrangement were included in unearned revenues 

table of contents in the years ended december   and  we recognized professional services revenues of  and  respectively  from such contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from professional services to emc customers were included in unearned revenues 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues of  and  respectively  from products and services purchased by emc for internal use pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from products and services purchased by emc for internal use were included in unearned revenues 
we purchased products and services from emc for  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  we have made payments to emc and emc has made payments to us 
the following table summarizes these payments made between us and emc during the years ended december   and for the year ended december  payments from us to emc payments from emc to us payments between us and emc under the tax sharing agreement primarily relate to our portion of federal income taxes on emc consolidated tax return 
payments from us to emc primarily relate to periods for which we had stand alone federal taxable income  while payments from emc to us relate to periods for which we had a stand alone federal taxable loss 
the amounts that we either pay to or receive from emc for our portion of federal income taxes on emc s consolidated tax return differ from the amounts we would owe on a stand alone basis and the difference is presented as a component of stockholders equity 
in  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as a decrease in stockholders equity of in and  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as an increase in stockholders equity of and  respectively 
in certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity  we contract with emc subsidiaries for support services and emc personnel who are managed by us 
the costs incurred by emc on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had we contracted for such services with an unrelated third party 
these costs are included as expenses in our consolidated statements of income and primarily include salaries  benefits  travel and rent 
additionally  emc incurs certain administrative costs on our behalf in the us that are also recorded as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
the total cost of the services provided to us by emc as described above was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable to emc and included in interest expense with emc on our consolidated statements of income 
our interest expense as a separate  stand alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of  we acquired certain assets relating to emc s mozy cloud based data storage and data center services  including certain data center assets and a license to certain intellectual property 
emc retained ownership of the mozy business and its remaining assets 
emc continues to be responsible to mozy customers for mozy products and services and continues to recognize revenue from such products and services 
we entered into an operational support agreement with emc through the end of  pursuant to which we took over responsibility to operate the mozy service on behalf of emc 
pursuant to the support agreement  costs incurred by us to support emc s mozy services  plus a mark up intended to approximate third party costs and a management fee  are reimbursed to us by emc 
on the consolidated statements of income  in the years ended december  and  such amounts were and  respectively 
these amounts were recorded as a reduction to the costs we incurred 
as of december   the operational support agreement between us and emc was amended such that we will no longer operate the mozy service on behalf of emc 
under the amendment  we will transfer substantially all employees that support mozy services to emc and emc will purchase certain assets from us in relation to transferred employees 
the termination of service and related transfer of employees and sale of assets is anticipated to be substantially completed during the first quarter of in  we acquired certain software product technology and expertise from emc s ionix it management business for cash consideration of emc retained the ionix brand and will continue to offer customers the products acquired by us  pursuant to an ongoing reseller agreement between emc and us 
during the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of contingent amounts were paid to emc 
these payments were recorded as equity transactions and 
table of contents were offsets to the initial capital contribution from emc 
as of december   all contingent payments under the agreement had been made 
from time to time  we and emc enter into agreements to collaborate on technology projects 
in the years ended december   and  we received  and  respectively  from emc for emc portion of expenses related to such projects 
effective september   pat gelsinger succeeded paul maritz as chief executive officer of vmware 
prior to joining us  pat gelsinger was the president and chief operating officer of emc information infrastructure products 
paul maritz remains a board member of vmware and took on the role of chief strategy officer of emc 
with the exception of a long term incentive performance award from emc that pat gelsinger agreed to cancel in consideration of a new performance stock unit award from vmware  both paul maritz and pat gelsinger retained and continue to vest in their respective equity awards that they held as of september  stock based compensation related to pat gelsinger s emc awards will be recognized on our consolidated statements of income over the awards remaining requisite service periods 
stock based compensation related to paul maritz s vmware awards will be recognized as an expense by emc 
as of december   we had net due from emc  which consisted of due from emc  partially offset by due to emc 
as of december   we had net due from emc  which consisted of due from emc  partially offset by due to emc 
these amounts resulted from the related party transactions described above 
additionally  we had a net income tax payable due to emc of and as of december  and  which were included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheets 
balances due to or from emc which are unrelated to tax obligations are generally settled in cash within days of each quarter end 
the timing of the tax payments due to and from emc is governed by the tax sharing agreement with emc 
in december  we launched the pivotal initiative with emc  pursuant to which both companies plan to commit technology  people and programs 
by nature of emc s majority ownership of us  the amounts we recorded for our intercompany transactions with emc may not be considered arm s length with an unrelated third party 
therefore the financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows had we engaged in such transactions with an unrelated third party during all periods presented 
accordingly  our historical results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance as a stand alone company 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  we held cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as follows december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   we held a diversified portfolio of money market funds and fixed income securities totaling  our fixed income securities were denominated in us dollars and consisted of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  us municipal obligations  and us and foreign corporate debt securities 
we limit the amount of our domestic and international investments with any single issuer and any single financial institution  and also monitor the diversity of the portfolio  thereby diversifying the credit risk 
within our portfolio  we held of foreign government and agencies securities  of which was deemed sovereign debt  at december  these sovereign debt securities had an average credit rating of aaa and were predominantly from canada 
none of the securities deemed sovereign debt were from greece  ireland  italy  portugal or spain 
as of december   our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  of which  was held outside the us if these overseas funds were needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on related undistributed earnings to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non us earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in and to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
while we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating 
table of contents requirements  our overall level of cash needs may be impacted by the number and size of acquisitions and investments we consummate and the amount of stock we buy back in should we require additional liquidity  we may seek to arrange debt financing or enter into credit facilities 
our cash flows for  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and other adjustments 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by to  in the from  in the decrease was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments we received from emc under the tax sharing agreement 
under the tax sharing agreement  emc is obligated to pay us an amount equal to the tax benefit generated by us and we are obligated to pay emc an amount equal to the tax expense generated by us that emc may recognize in a given year on its consolidated tax return 
in  we received from emc under the tax sharing agreement  but in we benefited from the net receipt of  which included amounts primarily related to refunds received for both the and tax years 
in future periods  we expect to be in a net payable position to emc 
in  cash provided by operating activities benefited from increases in cash collections driven by growth in sales to our customers and was negatively impacted by increases in our core operating expenses  primarily due to headcount 
in  increases in cash collections from customers outpaced the increases in our core operating expenses 
additionally  the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation decreased by in  which positively impacted our cash provided by operating activities 
this change was primarily due to changes in the market value of our stock and the number of equity awards exercised  sold or vested 
cash provided by operating activities increased by to  in from  in the increase in operating cash flows for was primarily the result of an increase in cash collections from customers driven by strong sales volumes 
in addition  we benefited from the net receipt of from emc related to income taxes 
during  there were no significant amounts collected from or paid to emc under the tax sharing agreement 
the net receipt of in primarily related to refunds received for both the and tax years 
the increase in cash collections and the benefit from the collection of the income tax receivable was partially offset by increases in our core operating expenses  primarily related to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions 
in evaluating our liquidity internally  we focus on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flows over trailing twelve months periods  which we consider to be a relevant measure of our long term progress 
we define free cash flows  a non gaap financial measure  as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
see non gaap financial measures for additional information 
our free cash flows for  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flows free cash flows decreased by or to  for from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of for net amounts we received from emc under the tax sharing agreement as described above 
this decrease was partially offset by the net benefit received from increased sales and related cash collections that outpaced our growth in operating expenses 
free cash flows increased by or to  for from  in the 
table of contents increase was primarily due to increased sales and related cash collections that outpaced our growth in operating expenses 
additionally  we benefited from the net receipt of from emc under the tax sharing agreement in investing activities cash used in investing activities is generally attributable to the purchase of fixed income securities  business acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to the sales or maturities of fixed income securities 
total fixed income securities of   and  were purchased in  and  respectively 
all purchases of fixed income securities were classified as cash outflows from investing activities 
we classified these investments as short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the nature of the security and their availability for use in current operations or for other purposes  such as business acquisitions and strategic investments 
these cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of   and in  and  respectively  as a result of the sales and maturities of fixed income securities 
activity in the fixed income portfolio increased each year primarily from increased cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances available for investment  including a reallocation of funds from cash equivalents to fixed income securities 
we did not capitalize any development costs for software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed in as compared to and of costs capitalized in and  respectively 
following the release of vsphere and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of  we determined that our go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this change in strategy  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
in  and  we paid  and  respectively  for business acquisitions 
the increase in is primarily related to the acquisition of nicira which was completed in the third quarter of and included  of cash consideration 
refer to note b to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
business acquisitions are an important element of our strategy and we expect to continue to consider additional strategic business acquisitions in the future 
in  we closed an agreement to purchase all of the right  title and interest in a ground lease covering the property and improvements located adjacent to our existing palo alto  california campus for based upon the respective fair values  of the purchase price was included within additions to property and equipment  and the remaining paid and attributed to the intangible assets was separately disclosed within net cash used in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
refer to note g to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
our renovation of the new property will be a multi year project with capital investment extending into future periods 
in the second quarter of  we sold our investment in terremark worldwide  inc for financing activities proceeds from the issuance of our class a common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the vmware employee stock purchase plan espp were  and in  and  respectively 
in  and  as part of our share repurchase programs  we repurchased and retired shares of our class a common stock as shown below table in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended december  aggregate purchase price class a common shares repurchased weighted average price per share from time to time  stock repurchases may be made pursuant to the stock repurchase authorizations in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
we are not obligated to purchase any shares under our stock repurchase programs 
the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including our stock price  cash requirements for operations and business combinations  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market and economic conditions 
purchases can be discontinued at any time that we feel that additional purchases are not warranted 
as of december   the authorized amount remaining available for repurchase was this amount is authorized for repurchases through the end of 
table of contents there were additional cash outflows of  and in  and  respectively  to cover tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock 
additionally  the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation was  and in  and  respectively  and is shown as a reduction to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
the year over year changes in the repurchase of shares to cover tax withholding obligations and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation in and were primarily due to changes in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold or vested 
future cash proceeds from issuances of common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and future cash outflows to repurchase our shares to cover tax withholding obligations will depend upon  and could fluctuate significantly from period to period based on  the market value of our stock  the number of awards exercised  sold or vested  the tax benefit realized and the tax affected compensation recognized 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
note payable to emc as of december   remained outstanding on a note payable to emc  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
in june  we and emc amended and restated the note to extend the maturity date of the note to april  and to modify the principal amount of the note to reflect the outstanding balance of the interest rate continues to reset quarterly and bears an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points 
non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non gaap financial information 
our measures of core operating expenses and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
core operating expenses management uses the non gaap measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods  for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes  for short and long term operating plans  to calculate bonus payments and to evaluate our financial performance  the performance of our individual functional groups and the ability of operations to generate cash 
management believes that by excluding certain expenses that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results  core operating expenses reflect our business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business 
we define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components  which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses 
in each case  for the reasons set forth below  management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management  in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is generally fixed at the time the stock based instrument is granted and amortized over a period of several years 
although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  the expense for the fair value of the stock based instruments we utilize may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock based awards 
furthermore  unlike cash compensation  the value of stock options is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors  such as market volatility  that are beyond our control 
additionally  in order to establish the fair value of performance based stock awards  which are also an element of our ongoing stock based compensation  we are required to apply judgment to estimate the probability of the extent to which performance objectives will be achieved 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs 
capitalized software development costs encompass capitalization of development costs and the subsequent amortization of the capitalized costs over the useful life of the product 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs can vary significantly depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
we did not capitalize software development costs related to product offerings during in future periods  we expect our amortization expense from previously capitalized software development costs to steadily decline as previously capitalized software development costs become fully amortized 
for additional information  see results of operations capitalized software development costs  net above 
other expenses 
other expenses excluded are amortization of acquired intangible assets  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and other acquisition related items 
regarding the amortization of acquired intangible 
table of contents assets  we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  such as intellectual property  which is subject to amortization 
the amount of employer payroll taxes on stock based compensation is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business 
additionally  the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
acquisition related items include direct costs of acquisitions  such as transaction fees  which vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
we also do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle 
free cash flows in evaluating our liquidity internally  we focus on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flows over trailing twelve month periods  which we consider to be a relevant measure of our long term progress 
in  we changed our methodology for calculating free cash flows  which is reflected in the amounts presented for all periods  to be defined as gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures 
we include the impact from capital expenditures on property and equipment because these expenditures are also considered to be a necessary component of our operations and therefore part of our core operating expenses 
management uses free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business  as it balances operating results  cash management and capital efficiency 
we believe that free cash flows provides useful information to investors and others as it allows for meaningful period to period comparisons of our operating cash flows for analysis of trends in our business 
additionally  we believe that it provides investors and others with an important perspective on the amount of cash that we may choose to use for strategic acquisitions and investments  the repurchase of shares  operations and other capital expenditures 
limitations on the use of non gaap financial measures a limitation of our non gaap financial measures of core operating expenses and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our non gaap measures of core operating expenses and free cash flows should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
additionally  in the case of stock based compensation  if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes  the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 
further  the non gaap measure of core operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the gaap measure of total operating expenses 
we compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety  not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 
see results of operations operating expenses for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  for the years ended december    and see liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of free cash flows to the most comparable gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities  for the years ended december   and off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret or other intellectual property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury  or the acts or omissions by us and our employees  agents or representatives 
we have agreements with certain vendors  financial institutions  lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters  such as acts and omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that we have obtained the right to use in our products and agreements 
under some of these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors and executive officers  to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being 
table of contents or having been a director or officer 
our by laws and charter also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer 
we also indemnify certain employees who provide service with respect to employee benefits plans  including the members of the administrative committee of the vmware k plan  and employees who serve as directors or officers of our subsidiaries 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the former directors and officers of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons 
we typically purchase a tail directors and officers insurance policy  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification obligations related to the former officers and directors of an acquired company 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable to emc operating leases other agreements sub total uncertain tax positions total the note is due and payable in full on april   however  we can pay down the note at an earlier date in full or in part at our election 
our operating leases are primarily for office space and land around the world 
consisting of various contractual agreements  which include commitments on the lease for our washington data center facility 
as of december   we had of non current net unrecognized tax benefits 
we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the critical accounting policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a  overview and basis of presentation  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of software and related services 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

table of contents we recognize license revenues from the sale of software licenses when risk of loss transfers  which is generally upon electronic shipment 
we primarily license our software under perpetual licenses through our channel of distributors  resellers  system vendors  systems integrators and our direct sales force 
to the extent we offer product promotions and the promotional products are not yet available and vsoe of fair value cannot be established  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product obligations have been fulfilled 
we defer revenues relating to products that have shipped into our channel until our products are sold through to the next tier of the channel 
we estimate and record reserves for products that are not sold through the channel based on historical trends and relevant current information 
for software sold by system vendors that is bundled with their hardware  unless we have a separate license agreement which governs the transaction  revenue is recognized in arrears upon the receipt of binding royalty reports 
the accuracy of our reserves depends on our ability to estimate the product sold through the channels and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we offer rebates to certain channel partners  which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related product sale is recognized 
when rebates are based on the set percentage of actual sales  we recognize the costs of the rebates as a reduction of revenue when the underlying revenue is recognized 
in cases where rebates are earned if a cumulative level of sales is achieved  we recognize the cost of the rebates as a reduction of revenue proportionally for each sale that is required to achieve the target 
the estimated reserves for channel rebates and sales incentives are based on channel partners actual performance against the terms and conditions of the programs  historical trends and the value of the rebates 
the accuracy of these reserves for these rebates and sales incentives depends on our ability to estimate these items and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
with limited exceptions  vmware s return policy does not allow product returns for a refund 
certain distributors and resellers may rotate stock when new versions of a product are released 
we estimate future product returns at the time of sale 
our estimate is based on historical return rates  levels of inventory held by distributors and resellers and other relevant factors 
the accuracy of these reserves depends on our ability to estimate sales returns and stock rotation among other criteria 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
returns have not been material to date and have been in line with our expectations 
our services revenues consist of software maintenance  professional services and software as a service subscriptions 
software as a service subscriptions were not material in any period presented 
we recognize software maintenance revenues ratably over the contract period 
typically  our software maintenance contract periods range from one to five years 
professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products because services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours and direct expenses incurred 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based upon hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
software as a service revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments regarding our services revenues  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
our multiple element arrangements typically fall into one or more of the following categories arrangements including undelivered elements for which vsoe of fair value has been established 
revenue for those undelivered items is recognized ratably over the service period  or as the services are delivered 
revenue allocated to the delivered elements is recognized upfront  arrangements including specified product elements for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established 
the entire arrangement fee is deferred until either vsoe of fair value is established or the specified products are delivered  arrangements including undelivered elements without vsoe of fair value that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products where all of the undelivered elements are delivered ratably over time 
revenue for the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably  once the services have commenced  over the longest delivery period  arrangements including undelivered elements without vsoe of fair value that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products where one or more of the elements are not delivered ratably over time 
the entire arrangement fee is deferred until vsoe of fair value is established or only elements that are delivered ratably over time remain 
at 
table of contents such time  a pro rated share of revenue is recognized immediately with any remaining fee recognized ratably over the longest remaining ratable delivery period 
customers under software maintenance agreements are entitled to receive updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis  as well as various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
in the event specific features or functionalities  entitlements or the release number of an upgrade have been announced but not delivered  and customers will receive that upgrade as part of a current software maintenance contract  a specified upgrade is deemed created 
as a result of the specified upgrade  product revenues are deferred on purchases made after the announcement date until delivery of the upgrade for those purchases that include the current version of the product subject to the announcement 
the amount and elements to be deferred are dependent on whether the company has established vsoe of fair value for the upgrade 
vsoe of fair value of these upgrades is established based upon the price set by management 
we have a history of selling such upgrades on a stand alone basis 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent with the sale of these elements on a stand alone basis 
our determination of vsoe is based on an analysis of the sales of our products  primarily maintenance and professional services on a stand alone basis 
however  judgment is required in assessing whether fluctuations in sales prices represent anomalies or whether the product pricing is changing on a more consistent basis 
this determination could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and non software elements such as our software as a service subscription offerings  we allocate revenue to software or software related elements as a group and any non software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy 
we determine the relative selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price besp for that deliverable 
once revenue is allocated to software or software related elements as a group  it follows historic software accounting guidance 
revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions 
at this time  we use besp to determine the relative selling price of our license elements and software as a service elements based upon rates charged in both multi element and stand alone arrangements 
if we modify our pricing practices in the future  this could result in changes in relative selling prices 
additionally  as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in relative selling prices  including both vsoe and besp 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt expense could exceed our estimate 
whenever indicators of potential impairment are present  our analysis of potential impairment involves judgment in grouping our intangible assets based on the expected period during which the assets will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
as we operate our business in one operating segment and one reporting unit  our goodwill is assessed at the consolidated level for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assessment is performed by comparing the market value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  management judgment is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 

table of contents we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we do not provide for a us income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the earnings of non us subsidiaries  which reflect full provision for non us income taxes  are indefinitely reinvested in non us operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax 
if these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on related undistributed earnings to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non us earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows generated from our us operations  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in locations in which it is needed 
income taxes are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although we are included in the consolidated tax return of emc 
the difference between the income taxes payable that is calculated on a separate return basis and the amount actually paid to emc pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with emc is presented as a component of additional paid in capital 
capitalized software development costs development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the product technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established and as our business  products and go to market strategy have evolved  we have continued to evaluate when technological feasibility is established 
following the release of vsphere and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of  we determined that vmware go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
for future releases  we expect our products to be available for general release soon after technological feasibility has been established 
given that we expect the majority of our product offerings to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with our other product offerings  the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods 
in  all software development costs were expensed as incurred 
our r d expenses and amounts that we have capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
additionally  future changes in our judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or additional changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  could materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability was to increase again in the future  the amount of capitalized costs would likely increase 
additionally  a transition to offering software as a service instead of via a license may also result in an increased level of software capitalization 
generally accepted accounting principles require annual amortization expense of capitalized software development costs to be the greater of the amounts computed using the ratio of current gross revenue to a product s total current and anticipated revenues  or the straight line method over the product s remaining estimated economic life 
to date  we have amortized these costs using the straight line method as it is the greater of the two amounts 
the costs are amortized over to months  which represent the product s estimated economic life 
the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
material differences in amortization amounts could occur as a result of changes in the periods over which we actually generate revenues or the amounts of revenues generated 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we operate in foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
we invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
additionally  a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  sales and sales support and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those currencies in which we also invoice and collect 
revenues resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income 
as exchange rates vary  operating margins may differ materially from expectations 
we calculate the foreign currency impact on our revenues and operating expenses as the difference between amounts translated at current exchange rates and the same amounts translated at prior period exchange rates 
license revenues were negatively impacted by million in and benefited by million in due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies as compared with the same periods in the prior year 
given that we began to invoice and collect in currencies other than the us dollar during the second quarter of  we are not able to calculate a full year over year impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues for additionally  core operating expenses benefited by million in and were negatively impacted by million and million in and  respectively  due to fluctuations in the exchange rates 
to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward contracts  as described below 
cash flow hedging activities 
to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations resulting from operating expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts starting in the fourth quarter of we typically enter into cash flow hedges semi annually with maturities of six months or less 
as of december  and  we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase approximately million and million  respectively  in foreign currency 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  and balance sheet hedging activities 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities against movements in certain foreign exchange rates 
our foreign currency forward contracts are traded on a monthly basis with a typical contractual term of one month 
as of december  and  we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  and sensitivity analysis 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted in a potential loss of million in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts used in both the cash flow hedging and balance sheet hedging activities as of december  this sensitivity analysis disregards any potentially offsetting gain that may be associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge 
this analysis also assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we do not enter into speculative foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk fixed income securities our fixed income investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars and consists of various holdings  types  and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
hypothetical changes in interest rates of basis points and basis points would have changed the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio as of december  by million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates  however  interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risk  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no

note payable to emc as of december   million was outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet for the note payable to emc 
the interest rate on the note payable was as of december   as of december  and as of december  in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable 
the note may be repaid  without penalty  at any time 
in the second quarter of  we and emc amended and restated the note to extend the maturity date of the note to april  and to modify the principal amount of the note to reflect the outstanding balance of million 
the amended agreement continues to bear an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest rate on the note resets quarterly and is determined on the two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
if the interest rate on the note payable were to change basis points from the december  rate  and assuming no additional repayments on the principal were made  our annual interest expense would change by million 
equity price risk during  we sold our investment in terremark worldwide  inc  which was acquired by verizon 
as a result of the sale of our investment  we no longer have investments in equity securities that expose us to market risk associated with publicly traded equity securities
