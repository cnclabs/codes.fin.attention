table of contents part ii item overview operating performance compared to our operating income for was million compared to million in our operating results continued to be negatively impacted by weak us housing and real estate markets 
despite a improvement in housing starts in compared to the prior year  housing starts in were nearly below the historical level of between million and million annual starts 
for several years housing starts have been near record low levels due to high unemployment  falling home values  an excess of supply of homes for sale  and difficulties obtaining financing for home and real estate purchases 
most of these negative factors started improving during and are expected to continue to improve in this should favorably impact our operating results in operating income in our northern resources segment decreased by million from million in to million in  despite a increase in sawlog harvest volumes 
this decrease was due primarily to higher costs on a per ton basis for logging and hauling  and higher road costs 
operating income in our southern resources segment increased by million from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to a increase in sawlog harvest volumes  a increase in pulpwood harvest volumes  and a increase in pulpwood prices 
operating income in our manufacturing products segment increased by million from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to higher prices and sales volumes for our plywood and mdf products as a result of improving demand 
operating income in our real estate segment decreased by million from million in to million in  despite selling approximately  acres in compared to selling approximately  acres in the decrease was due primarily to selling a greater percentage of properties from lower value regions in the us and selling properties that had a higher book value compared to the property sold in unallocated corporate expenses included in operating income were million in compared to million in the million increase in corporate expenses was due primarily to higher expense for incentive compensation  share based compensation  and information technology 
liquidity we ended with a strong balance sheet  and we do not foresee any liquidity issues in at december   we had a cash balance of million and availability on our line of credit of million 
during  we refinanced our term credit agreement  refinanced our revolving line of credit  and issued million of additional public debt  all at very attractive interest rates 
we have scheduled debt principal payments of million due in which will be fully funded from our public debt offering 
during we generated million of cash from operating activities which was only slightly less than the million we generated in in anticipation of higher log prices  we expect to generate adequate cash from operating activities in to fund planned capital expenditures and our dividend 
key economic factors impacting our resources and manufactured products business our operating performance for the resources and manufactured products segments is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs and wood products in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities  industrial activity and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
selected us housing economic data for the last five years was as follows at december plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item us housing starts in millions supply of existing homes for sale in months yr 
fixed interest mortgage rates average the housing market started to improve in and is expected to improve further in the improvement is being driven by rising home prices which increased approximately in  record low mortgage interest rates  low supply of new homes for sale on the market  pent up demand  and rising rental payments 
however  even with housing starts predicted to improve further in  housing starts remain well below the historical level of between million and million annual starts 
furthermore  the improvement in housing starts is being constrained by high unemployment currently at  weak wage growth  very strict lending standards  a large number of homeowners either in foreclosure or behind on their mortgage  and low consumer confidence 
as a result  a full housing recovery is not expected for several more years 
the improvement in the housing market along with the steady demand for lumber in the repair and remodel market which accounts for about of lumber usage has caused lumber prices to increase by nearly 
during the housing downturn  many lumber and plywood mills either closed permanently or curtailed production 
despite the improved lumber and plywood prices  many mill owners have been reluctant to re open or add shifts due to the uncertainty around the us economy 
southern sawlog prices have remained at historical low levels during the past several years 
despite the significant improvement in lumber and plywood prices during  there has been very little upward price movement for sawlogs 
there is an adequate supply of logs in the south for the current level of lumber and plywood production 
as housing starts continue to improve in  we expect more mills will either re start or add additional shifts to increase their production  which we expect will increase prices for sawlogs 
while we believe favorable demographics will bode well for the wood products business in the long run and that eventually housing starts will return to normal levels  in the near term there remains uncertainty around the demand and supply of wood products and around the demand and supply for sawlogs  all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results 
we use independent third party contract loggers and haulers to deliver our logs to our customers 
as weak business conditions in the timber business have persisted for several years  there are fewer of these contractors available in certain markets to produce and deliver logs 
while we continue to enhance strong working relationships with our loggers and haulers  as log markets improve there may be production and delivery constraints that could impact log prices and  potentially  our ability to benefit from these conditions by delivering logs 
in  fuel prices increased slightly and this change only had a small impact on operating income 
over the past several years  however  fuel prices have fluctuated significantly 
our timber and manufacturing operations are significantly impacted by changing fuel prices 
the table below summarizes the average annual us on highway diesel fuel prices and the impact of fluctuating fuel prices on our operating income for the years ended december increase decrease operating income in millions n a annual average us on highway diesel price per gallon higher value and non strategic timberlands from time to time  we review our timberlands to identify properties that may have higher values other than as commercial timberlands see discussion in item real estate segment 
we estimate that included in the company million acres of timberlands at december   are approximately  acres of higher value timberlands which are expected to be sold  exchanged  and or developed over the next years for recreational  conservation  commercial and residential purposes 
included within the  acres of higher value timberlands are approximately  acres we expect to sell for recreational uses  approximately  acres we expect to sell for conservation and plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item approximately  acres that are identified as having development potential 
furthermore  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the near and medium term in smaller scale transactions small non strategic 
not included in the above  higher value acres and  small non strategic acres are other acres that are expected to be sold in large acreage transactions to commercial timberland buyers as opportunities arise large non strategic 
some of our real estate activities  including our real estate development business  are conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
in the meantime  all of our timberlands continue to be managed productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
during  we sold approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties for proceeds of million  approximately  acres of conservation properties for proceeds of million  approximately  acres of small non strategic properties for proceeds of million  along with approximately  acres of large non strategic properties for proceeds of million 
we expect revenue from real estate sales during to range between million and million 
while revenue from large non strategic sales during was greater than of total real estate revenue  in we expect revenues from large non strategic sales to be less than of total real estate revenue 
our land development business slowed dramatically starting in and has since remained weak 
we do not expect any significant proceeds from the sale of real estate development properties in we expect our residential real estate development business to remain weak until there is a significant improvement in consumer confidence  real estate values begin appreciating and financing becomes available for such properties 
harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood product mix included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during we expect total harvest levels to be comparable to harvest levels 
while we have the flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels to be comparable over the near term next five years and increase by more than over the long term ten years and beyond compared to harvest levels as the timber inventory grows 
future harvest levels may vary from historic or expected levels due to weaker or stronger than anticipated markets or other factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by the acquisition of timberlands or the disposition of timberlands beyond the million acres described above in the higher value and non strategic timberlands section 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition for timber sales timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut sales contracts or timber deed sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item pay as cut sales contracts 
pay as cut sales contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut sales contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut sales contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut sales contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
timber deeds 
timber deed sales are agreements in which the buyer agrees to purchase and harvest specified timber ie mature pulpwood and or sawlogs on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually less than months 
unlike a pay as cut sales contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed and we do not have any additional performance obligations 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs and the timing of such activity 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed because the earnings process is complete 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales timber deed sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately  and of our timber sales in  and  respectively  consisted of pay as cut sales contracts and timber deed sales 
under sales of stumpage  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  therefore  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is typically higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the ability of buyers to obtain financing  the number of competing properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
over the last ten years  the real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage has ranged from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  sales of properties that have been held by the company for a long time ie decades will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages than properties that have been held by the company for shorter time periods 
in contrast  the sale of conservation easements will generally have an operating profit percentage of close to because historically no book basis was allocated to these development rights 
in general  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations 
in connection with timberland acquisitions  we are generally not able to identify  with any level of precision  our future real estate sales ie specific properties with a higher value than for use in timber production 
however  our purchase price allocation and related appraisals for these acquisitions may reflect greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future but are not yet specifically identified 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all of the acres acquired 
specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets when required by the accounting standards 
we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in our business when the carrying value net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
generally  our fair value measurements used in calculating an impairment loss are categorized as level measurements ie unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity under the fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards codification 
typically  we will use a discounted cash flow model or an external appraisal to estimate the fair value of the affected assets 
furthermore  we recognize an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
the company has had a long history of acquiring timberlands 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
our long lived assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into seven geographic areas in the northern resources segment and five geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
for assets used in our business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our timber business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer eg  listed with a broker  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during the last several years  the above criteria have been met by some of our timberland properties  and we have recognized annual impairment losses of approximately million for certain of these properties see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management expects that the timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently listed for sale  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and to estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are listed for sale and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management expects the property will be sold within twelve months 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial buyers  and it is probable that we will recognize additional impairment losses  some of which could be material  in the future in connection with sales of timberlands 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our eight two of which have been curtailed manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs and availability  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
no impairment losses were recorded during  or we currently estimate that the carrying value for our eight facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to weaken for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines  we may record an impairment loss for one or more of our manufacturing facilities in a future period 
capitalized real estate development costs 
current and future costs associated with specific real estate development projects are capitalized once management has concluded it is probable that a project will be successful 
real estate development costs are expensed as incurred when management is not able to conclude that it is probable a project will be successful 
furthermore  previously capitalized costs for specific projects are written off when management revises its prior assessment and concludes that it is probable a project will not be successful and costs will not be recovered 
for many of our projects  there is less judgment in making this determination due to prior experience in the local market or advice from consultants 
however  for some of our larger projects where we have limited experience in the local market or for projects in environmentally sensitive areas  there is significant judgment in assessing the expected outcome for the projects 
at december   we have million of capitalized costs associated with projects that management expects will be successful 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested and sold 
depletion rates for each geographic area are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the original cost of the timber includes capitalized costs associated with the purchase of timber along with reforestation costs and other costs associated with the planting and growing of trees 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest

we expect depletion expense associated with the timber deed to be approximately million 
b does not include the timber deed purchased in for million 
c increase from is due primarily to an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs 
d increase from is due primarily to an increase in volume in oregon associated with the release of restricted acres 
e assumes future timber volumes do not change 
f assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item depletion expense in average depletion rates per ton in for our southern resources segment are expected to decrease compared to due primarily to changes in our growth rate and silviculture investment assumptions 
we are assuming higher growth rates as a result of improved genetics in the seedlings we have planted on our timberlands over the last two decades 
the improved genetics have resulted in higher yields per acre than we previously estimated 
we are also assuming lower future silviculture expenditures ie  reduced treatments per timber stand due primarily to better than expected growth rates from improved genetics 
we expect these assumption changes will decrease southern resources segment depletion expense by approximately million in accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of shares of the company stock including  but not limited to  common stock awards  restricted stock units and value management awards 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
grants of value management awards are classified and accounted for as liabilities 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period is based on the fair value as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation cost for value management awards is based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return and simulated relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer group is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole and risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the liability for outstanding value management awards as of december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months that services were provided during the performance period 
the liability as of december  could range between and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards during the quarter 
pensions pension plans overview 
plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits vest after three years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
participants who were employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance benefits or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
it is generally the company s policy to fund the qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued over a market cycle generally to years 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plan 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors and  therefore  are not considered plan assets 
under current us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the company makes estimates and plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item assumptions that can have a significant impact on the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
these assumptions and their sensitivities  along with the application of the accounting principles and impact to our financial statements  are discussed in the next several sections 
current year impact and analysis 
during  our pension liability increased from million to million and our pension assets increased from million to million 
our pension liability represents the present value of expected future benefit payments and is remeasured annually as of december each year  our pension liability increases due to employees working for one more year service cost  and getting one year closer to receiving benefit payments interest cost  and decreases as pension benefits are paid 
our pension liability is also adjusted due to changes in interest rates 
during  our pension liability increased by million an actuarial loss due to declining interest rates 
actuarial losses are initially recognized in other comprehensive income loss and then subsequently amortized charged to pension expense over future periods 
annually  our plan assets increase due to cash contributions from the company  decrease due to pension benefit payments  and will increase or decrease as a result of realized and unrealized gains and losses for the assets 
our pension expense is reduced by the expected returns on plan assets 
we currently estimate that our long term return on plan assets will average per year 
based on the plan assets balance  our pension expense was reduced by million the expected return on plan assets in dollars 
the actual return on plan assets was a gain of million for we initially recognize this difference surplus of million in other comprehensive income loss and then subsequently it will reduce pension expense over future periods 
at december   our cumulative net actuarial pension loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was million includes both unrecognized changes in our pension liability and plan assets  of which million will be amortized charged to pension expense 
each year the future amortization of our actuarial pension loss recognized in pension expense will increase or decrease due to changes in interest rates and actual returns on plan assets compared to expected returns 
additionally  while not expected  future company contributions may need to be increased to the extent interest rates remain low or to the extent that actual investment returns on plan assets do not meet our expectations 
significant assumptions 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under us gaap requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rates a annuity distributions lump sum distributions rate of compensation increase b assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate annuity distributions lump sum distributions expected long term return on plan assets c rate of compensation increase b a the december  discount rate for annuity distributions was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  the december  discount rate for lump sum distributions is based on yields on year us treasury bonds 
b the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item c the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
since pension benefits may be settled in either a single lump sum or an annuity distribution  both the estimated percentage of participants electing a lump sum payment and the assumed interest rate discount rate used in computing the lump sum benefit are key assumptions 
we currently estimate that approximately half of the qualified plan participants will elect a lump sum distribution upon termination 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets

events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual timber sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix or silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to almost million acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by sales and purchases of timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels are also impacted by the purchase of a long term timber deed 
in january  the company acquired approximately million tons of standing timber in our southern resources segment for a total purchase price of million 
we expect to harvest the million tons plus the related growth over the eight year term of the timber deed 
northern resources segment 
harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect total harvest volumes to be essentially comparable to at approximately million tons 
we expect sawlog harvest volumes to decrease marginally due to recent harvest schedule updates  timber inventory updates  and land sales 
we expect pulpwood harvest volumes in to be similar to while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels beyond in both the near term and long term to be generally comparable to harvest levels and we expect the product mix ie  the percentage of sawlogs vs 
pulpwood to be comprised of at least sawlogs 
southern resources segment 
harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect total harvest volumes to range between million and million tons 
in anticipation of higher sawlog prices  we expect sawlog harvest volumes to increase 
we expect pulpwood harvest volumes in to decline slightly compared to as a result  we expect product mix to be approximately sawlogs and pulpwood in while the company has flexibility to modify our annual harvest volumes  based on market conditions  we expect harvest levels beyond to be at comparable levels over the near term next five years 
thereafter  we expect harvest levels to increase more than over the long term ten years and beyond and we expect the product mix to improve  resulting in sawlogs comprising greater than of our annual harvest in the segment 
clean water act ninth circuit ruling in august   a three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled in northwest environmental defense center nedc v 
brown that ditches and culverts associated with forest roads were point sources under the clean water act cwa and thus required national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permits should storm water runoff that is channeled and or conveyed from such sources be discharged into waters of the united states 
in may   the court denied a petition for rehearing  leaving its prior decision in place 
the plaintiff plum creek form k 
table of contents part ii item alleged that the defendants violated the cwa by not obtaining epa permits for stormwater runoff from logging roads into systems of ditches  culverts and channels that is then discharged into forest streams and rivers 
the plaintiff further alleged that timber hauling on logging roads is a major source of sediment that flows through the stormwater collection system 
this decision overturns a long standing epa rule that had exempted such sources of runoff from cwa permitting 
since  the epa has promulgated and amended a regulation specifically exempting from npdes permitting requirements point source silviculture activities such as nursery operations  site preparation  reforestation and subsequent silvicultural treatment  thinning  prescribed burning  pest and fire control  harvesting operations  surface drainage  or road construction and maintenance from which there is natural runoff the silviculture rule 
under the silviculture rule  the epa did not require permitting for discharges from ditches  culverts and channels that collect stormwater runoff from logging roads 
instead  these forestry sources of stormwater runoff are regulated by the states  many of which do so by adopting best management practices 
the outcome of the ninth circuit court decision is uncertain 
the us supreme court recently reviewed the decision  and a ruling is expected sometime in march or april in addition  legislation passed by congress in late december prohibited the epa from implementing the npdes permitting regime mandated by the ninth circuit decision through september  should the ninth circuit ruling stand and congress not enact an effective and permanent legislative response  the decision impact on the company and the timber industry is unknown 
it is unclear whether the epa would require npdes permits for forest roads outside of the area covered by the ninth circuit court jurisdiction 
it is also unclear what  if any  additional regulatory restrictions would be imposed by the npdes permitting process 
further  if logging and other forest management roads and operations currently within the scope of the silviculture rule were placed within the npdes permitting regime  it is possible that cwa total maximum daily load tmdl allocations in various stream drainages  anti degradation  and other npdes requirements could be affected 
a significant increase in operational and compliance costs for landowners and operators is possible depending upon the regulatory response to the court decision 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures

the primary reason for the stable prices is that while the demand for domestic sawlogs improved during  the demand for export logs slowed 
however  sawlog prices strengthened during the fourth quarter  and the upward price pressure has continued in the improved sawlog prices are due primarily to lumber and plywood mills adding additional shifts  limited imports from canada  and a limited log supply due to weather related harvesting restrictions 
in  we expect total harvest volumes to be essentially comparable to at approximately million tons

sawlog harvest volumes were higher in compared to due primarily to harvesting volume from the timber deed acquired at the beginning of the year million tons and the harvesting of previously deferred sawlog volume 
in january  we purchased a timber deed containing approximately million tons of standing timber which along with future growth  will be harvested over the eight year term of the deed 
pulpwood harvest volumes were higher in compared to due primarily to a sustained increase in growth rates  which are yielding higher pulpwood volumes in connection with the thinning of timber stands  and a temporary increase in pulpwood harvests due to relatively strong pulpwood prices 
pulpwood prices were higher in compared to due primarily to continued strong demand from pulp and paper customers as a result of a steady increase in production due to a moderately improving us economy 
the demand for pulpwood was also favorably impacted in by the increased production of oriented strandboard osb and the export of wood pellets used to produce bioenergy 
despite the nearly increase in housing starts and the nearly increase in lumber prices in compared to the prior year  southern sawlog prices remained at near historic low levels due primarily to adequate log supply and limited demand improvement 
there currently is an adequate supply of logs throughout most of the south for the current level of housing starts  which is approximately below the historical average 
additionally  most southern mill owners have been reluctant to add additional shifts due to concerns over the us economy 
in  we expect total harvest volumes to range between million and million tons

revenues from the sale of large non strategic timberlands was million in compared to million during during the company increased the sale of large non strategic properties to take advantage of attractive prices and favorable demand from commercial timberland and institutional buyers 
additionally  the price per acre for large non strategic timberlands can vary significantly due to the geographic location  the stocking level including timber species and age class distribution  the timber growing rates  and the demand and supply of wood fiber in the local market 
revenues from small non strategic sales during increased by million to million due primarily to selling a collection of approximately  acres to a single buyer during the second quarter and selling a  acre package during the fourth quarter 
the demand for higher value rural real estate generally remains weak 
we continue to experience favorable demand for lower value acreage in some regions of the country 
revenues from the sale of conservation properties decreased due primarily to selling large parcels in two sales totaling  acres in florida  arkansas and louisiana during conservation sales vary significantly from period to period and are primarily impacted by government and not for profit funding  the limited number of conservation buyers  and the timing of our transactions 
additionally  the price per acre for conservation properties can vary significantly due to the geographic location and the rationale for the conservation designation 
revenues from our higher and better use recreational land sales decreased due primarily to selling approximately  or fewer acres compared to most of the reduction in acreage sold is the result of selling a large parcel of approximately  acres for approximately million during demand for higher and better use recreational properties especially our higher value properties remains weak due to concerns over near term real estate values  low consumer confidence  and the inability of buyers to secure debt financing 
additionally  many high net worth buyers of large higher and better use recreational parcels are waiting for indicators of recovery in the rural real estate market 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the ability of buyers to obtain financing  the number of competing properties listed for sale  the seasonal nature of sales particularly in the northern states  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding especially for conservation sales

we expect revenue from real estate sales during to range between million and million 
while revenue from large non strategic sales during was greater than of total real estate revenue  in we expect revenues from large non strategic sales to be less than of total real estate revenue 
the real estate segment operating income as a percent of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for this decrease is due primarily to selling large non strategic properties with significantly lower operating margins in compared to the margins generated in the majority of the acreage sold in was in lower value regions compared to the land sold during and most of the property sold in was acquired within the past decade and therefore had a higher book value than the property sold in real estate segment costs and expenses increased by million to million in due primarily to selling more acres during and selling large non strategic property during with a higher book value compared to the book value of properties sold in manufactured products segment

mdf sales volume was higher during compared to due primarily to an increase in demand and reduced supply 
mdf demand increased from many of our industrial customers for products such as molding  architectural doors and store fixtures 
the supply of mdf in north america has declined due primarily to lower imports and curtailed production at high cost domestic mills 
the lower imports are primarily the result of foreign manufacturers targeting their production to more attractive global markets 
additionally  the reduced supply has allowed for modest mdf price increases during mdf average prices were higher during compared to the prior year 
plywood sales volume was higher during compared to due primarily to a modest increase in demand and reduced supply 
we have experienced improvement in demand from both our industrial eg  truck trailers and commercial eg  concrete form customers 
the supply of plywood in north america has declined due primarily to a combination of domestic mill curtailments and many currently operating plywood plants not adding shifts to increase production 
the reduced supply has allowed for plywood price increases during and  as a result  plywood average prices were higher during compared to the prior year

our determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing  nature and amount of future taxable income earned by certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
a valuation allowance is recognized if management believes it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we have recorded deferred tax assets of million net of a million valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities of million 
management believes that due to the reversal of various taxable temporary differences and or the planned execution of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  sufficient taxable income can be generated to utilize the company remaining deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was determined to be unnecessary

for a discussion of the factors impacting our liquidity  see the discussion included previously in item under financial condition and liquidity 
we have included the following non gaap measurements because we believe these are commonly used by investors  lenders and rating agencies to assess our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings from continuing operations  excluding equity method earnings  and before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  and basis in lands sold 
adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and the items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components of our consolidated financial statements 
we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period  and each business segment s contribution to that performance  by eliminating non cash charges to earnings  which can vary significantly by business segment 
these non cash charges include timber depletion  depreciation of fixed assets and the basis in lands sold 
we also use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we believe it is useful in measuring our ability to generate cash
