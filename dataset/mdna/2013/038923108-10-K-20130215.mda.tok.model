item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge loans  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we have also invested in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases  this will have a negative impact on earnings 
however  if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio 
see current market conditions  risks and recent trends below for risks and trends of our net interest income 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
if there are increases in foreclosures and non performing loans and investments  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses and asset management related expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
as of december   and  we were in compliance with all reit requirements and  therefore  have not provided for income tax expense for the years ended december   and  except for million of federal alternative minimum tax and million of estimated state income taxes incurred in those states that do not adopt the federal tax law that allows us to elect to defer income generated from certain debt extinguishment transactions  recorded in under current federal tax law  the gain and the tax on the gain of certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in and have been deferred to future periods at our election 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of estimated state income taxes incurred in those states that do not adopt the federal tax law that allows us to elect to defer income generated from certain debt extinguishment transactions as well as a deferred tax provision of million 
certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or 
table of contents operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million receivable for the refund of federal income taxes paid by a taxable reit subsidiary in a prior year  which was received in for the years ended december   and  we did not record a provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
current market conditions  risks and recent trends global stock and credit markets have experienced prolonged price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions over the past several years  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially 
commercial real estate has been particularly adversely affected by the past economic downturn 
although we have seen some improvements  the overall market recovery remains uncertain 
should the market regress  the commercial real estate sector may experience additional losses  challenges in complying with the terms of financing agreements  difficulty in raising capital  and challenges in obtaining investment financing with attractive terms or at all 
if market conditions continue to stabilize  we will rely on the credit and equity markets to generate capital for financing the growth of our business 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets and have resulted in the scarcity of certain types of financing  and  in certain cases  making terms for certain financings less attractive 
if these conditions persist  lending institutions may be forced to exit markets such as repurchase lending  become insolvent  further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing  and in such event  could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing for our investments 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay our loans as they may experience difficulties in selling assets  increased costs of financing or obtaining financing at all 
these events in the stock and credit markets may also make it more difficult or unlikely for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us or the economy in general 
the past economic downturn has had a significant impact on our business  our borrowers and real estate values throughout all asset classes and geographic locations 
if real estate values decline further  it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties 
borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans 
declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate  sell and securitize loans  which would significantly impact our revenues  results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  our investments are also subject to the risks described above with respect to commercial real estate loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  the dependence upon the successful operation of  and net income from  real property  risks generally related to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  due to declining collateral values  and million in net recoveries of reserves 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  million in net recoveries of reserves  and 
table of contents million of loss on sale and restructuring of loans 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  due to declining collateral values  million in net recoveries of reserves  and a million loss on sale and restructuring of loans 
in addition  we acquired two new real estate owned properties through a transfer from a creditor trust and a purchase out of bankruptcy  respectively  in the first quarter of we have made  and continue to make modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so 
in some cases  a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms 
in doing so  lower borrower interest rates  combined with non performing loans  will lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing 
these trends may persist with a prolonged economic downturn and we feel if they do  there will be continued modifications and delinquencies in the foreseeable future  which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector 
while there continue to be effects from the economic downturn  we have seen market opportunities becoming available to us based on our strategic positioning 
as a result  we completed a public offering in the second quarter of in which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and another public offering in the fourth quarter of in which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from these offerings to make investments  to repurchase or pay liabilities and for general corporate purposes 
we also entered into an at the market atm equity offering sales agreement in the fourth quarter of whereby  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  from time to time we may issue and sell up to  shares of our common stock 
as of february   jmp has sold  shares for net proceeds of million 
further  we also completed our first collateralized loan obligation clo in the third quarter of in which we issued million of investment grade notes and a second clo in january in which we issued million of investment grade notes 
while there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the equity and debt markets  we will continue to pursue these and other available market opportunities as means to increase our liquidity and capital base 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock generating net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering costs 
in addition  the underwriters were granted an over allotment option for  shares of the preferred stock which expires in march on february   the underwriters exercised their option for  shares providing additional net proceeds of approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for additional risk factors 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest income may also be derived from profits on equity participation interests 
no such interest income was recognized in  and we also derive interest income from our investments in residential mortgage backed securities rmbs  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation cdo bond securities 
interest on these investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 

table of contents property operating income is derived from our hotel and multifamily real estate owned assets 
in and  property operating income represented approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
the operation of a portfolio of hotel properties that we own is seasonal with the majority of revenues earned in the first two quarters of the calendar year 
no such income was recognized in additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents net interest income and gains and losses recorded on our linked transactions  as well as loan structuring and defeasance fees  and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented approximately of our total revenues in  and income or loss from equity affiliates and gain or loss on sale of loans and real estate we derive income or loss from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties of our equity method investments and any other than temporary impairment of these investments on a single line item in the consolidated statement of operations as income or loss from equity affiliates 
in and  loss from equity affiliates totaled million and million  respectively  while in  income from equity affiliates was million 
we also may derive income or loss from the sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt or for investment in order to stabilize the property and dispose of it for a future anticipated return 
we may also acquire real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
in  we sold a real estate property that was part of a portfolio of hotel assets to a third party for a gain of million as well as two real estate held for sale properties acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure to third parties for a total gain of million 
in  we sold a real estate held for sale property acquired by a foreclosure sale to a third party for a gain of million 
no such gain or loss was recorded in significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification  the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 

table of contents loans  investments and securities loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that  in some cases  allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
at the time of purchase  we designate a security as available for sale  held to maturity  or trading depending on our ability and intent to hold it to maturity 
we do not have any securities designated as trading as of december  securities available for sale are reported at fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
unrealized losses that are determined to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings up to their credit component 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
the process may include  but is not limited to  assessment of recent market events and prospects for near term recovery  assessment of cash flows  internal review of the underlying assets securing the investments  credit of the issuer and the rating of the security  as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
management closely monitors market conditions on which it bases such decisions 
we also assess certain of our securities  other than those of high credit quality  to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary and  accordingly  should be written down to their fair value against earnings 
on a quarterly basis  we review these changes in estimated cash flows  which could occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  to determine if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions and is not necessarily intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment  including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date  and the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
from time to time  we may enter into an agreement to sell a loan 
these loans are considered held for sale and are valued at the lower of the loan carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
for the sale of loans  recognition occurs when ownership passes to the buyer 
impaired loans  allowance for loan losses  loss on sale and restructuring of loans and charge offs loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we evaluate each loan in our portfolio on a quarterly basis 
our loans are individually specific and unique as it relates to product type  geographic location  and collateral type  as well as to the rights and remedies and the position in the capital structure our loans and investments have in relation to the underlying collateral 
we evaluate all of this information as well as general market trends related to specific classes of assets  collateral type and geographic locations  when determining the appropriate assumptions such as capitalization and market discount rates  as well as the asset operating income and cash flows  in estimating the value of the underlying collateral when determining if a loan is impaired 
we utilize internally developed valuation models and techniques primarily consisting of discounted cash flow and direct capitalization models in determining the fair value of the underlying collateral on an individual loan 
we may also obtain a third party appraisal  
table of contents which may value the collateral through an as is or stabilized value methodology 
such appraisals may be used as an additional source of valuation information only and no adjustments are made to appraisals 
included in the evaluation of the capitalization and market discount rates  we consider not only assumptions specific to the collateral but also geographical and industry trends that could impact the collateral value 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level that is believed to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we had a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 
at december   we had a million allowance for loan losses related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 
loan terms may be modified if we determine that based on the individual circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral  a modification would more likely increase the total recovery of the combined principal and interest from the loan 
any loan modification is predicated upon a goal of maximizing the collection of the loan 
typical triggers for a modification would include situations where the projected cash flow is insufficient to cover required debt service  when asset performance is lagging the initial projections  where there is a requirement for rebalancing  where there is an impending maturity of the loan  and where there is an actual loan default 
loan terms that have been modified have included  but are not limited to interest rate  maturity date and in certain cases  principal amount 
length and amounts of each modification have varied based on individual circumstances and are determined on a case by case basis 
if the loan modification constitutes a concession whereas we do not receive ample consideration in return for the modification  and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot repay the loan under the current terms  then the modification is considered by us to be a troubled debt restructuring 
if we receive a benefit  either monetary or strategic  and the above criteria are not met  the modification is not considered to be a troubled debt restructuring 
we record interest on modified loans on an accrual basis to the extent that the modified loan is contractually current 
loss on restructured loans is recorded when we grant a concession to a borrower in the form of principal forgiveness related to a payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower or when we incur costs on behalf of the borrower related to the modification  payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower 
when a loan is restructured  we record the investment at net realizable value  taking into account the cost of all concessions at the date of restructuring 
the reduction in the recorded investment is recorded as a charge to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the loan is restructured 
in addition  a gain or loss may be recorded upon the sale of a loan to a third party as a charge to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the loan was sold 
no loss on sale and restructuring of loans was recorded for the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we recorded loss on sale and restructuring of loans of million and million  respectively 
charge offs to the allowance for loan losses occur when losses are confirmed through the receipt of cash or other consideration from the completion of a sale  when a modification or restructuring takes place in which we grant a concession to a borrower or agree to a discount in full or partial satisfaction of the loan  when we take ownership and control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan  when loans are reclassified as other investments  or when significant collection efforts have ceased and it is highly likely that a loss has been realized 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded charge offs to the allowance for loan losses of million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents real estate owned and held for sale real estate owned  shown net of accumulated depreciation and impairment charges  is comprised of real property acquired by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt 
the real estate acquired is recorded at the estimated fair value at the time of acquisition 
costs incurred in connection with the foreclosure of the properties collateralizing the real estate loans are expensed as incurred and costs subsequently incurred to extend the life or improve the assets subsequent to foreclosure are capitalized 
we allocate the purchase price of operating properties to land  building  tenant improvements  deferred lease cost for the origination costs of the in place leases  intangibles for the value of the above or below market leases at fair value and to any other identified intangible assets or liabilities 
we finalize the purchase price allocation on these assets within one year of the acquisition date 
we amortize the value allocated to the in place leases over the remaining lease term 
the value allocated to the above or below market leases are amortized over the remaining lease term as an adjustment to rental income 
real estate assets  including assets acquired by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt  that are operated for the production of income are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
ordinary repairs and maintenance which are not reimbursed by the tenants are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
our properties are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we recognize impairment if the undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
measurement of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the assets 
upon evaluating a property for impairment  many factors are considered  including estimated current and expected operating cash flows from the property during the projected holding period  costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset  expected capitalization rates  projected stabilized net operating income  selling costs  and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in the ordinary course of business 
valuation adjustments may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates  rent up periods  future economic conditions  and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property 
if future evaluations result in a diminution in the value of the property  the reduction will be recognized as an impairment charge at that time 
real estate is classified as held for sale when management commits to a plan of sale  the asset is available for immediate sale  there is an active program to locate a buyer  and it is probable the sale will be complete within one year 
properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated and the results of their operations are shown in discontinued operations 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued  on an individual asset basis  at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell 
we recognize sales of real estate properties upon closing 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized upon closing using the full accrual method when the collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured and we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or in part until collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and securities 
in certain instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  a prepayment fee and or deferred interest upon 
table of contents maturity 
in some cases  interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising from the purchase or origination of the loan or security 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management a full recovery of all contractual principal is not probable 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is resumed 
we record interest income on certain impaired loans to the extent cash is received  in which a loan loss reserve has been recorded  as the borrower continues to make interest payments 
we recorded loan loss reserves related to these loans as it was deemed that full recovery of principal and interest was not probable 
several of our loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the asset 
if management cannot make this determination  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
given the transitional nature of some of our real estate loans  we may require funds to be placed into an interest reserve  based on contractual requirements  to cover debt service costs 
we will analyze these interest reserves on a periodic basis and determine if any additional interest reserves are needed 
recognition of income on loans with funded interest reserves are accounted for in the same manner as loans without funded interest reserves 
we will not recognize any interest income on loans in which the borrower has failed to make the contractual interest payment due or has not replenished the interest reserve account 
as of december   we had total interest reserves of million on loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million and had three non performing loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million with a funded interest reserve of million 
income from non performing loans is generally recognized on a cash basis only to the extent it is received 
full income recognition will resume when the loan becomes contractually current and performance has recommenced 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flow distributions and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
we did not record interest income on such investments for the years ended december   or property operating income 
property operating income represents income associated with the operation of commercial real estate properties classified as real estate owned 
we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable  or are evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of property operating income relating to real estate owned properties 
we did not have property operating income in as of december   we had two real estate owned properties  a portfolio of multifamily assets that was purchased by us out of bankruptcy and a portfolio of hotel assets that was transferred to us by the owner  a creditor trust 
both of these portfolios were acquired in the first quarter of additionally  a real estate investment that was part of the portfolio of hotel properties was sold in  and two real estate investments were reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale in  resulting in the reclassification of all of the operating activity from these properties from property operating income and expenses into discontinued operations for all prior periods 
for more details see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
other income 
other income represents net interest income and gains and losses recorded on our linked transactions  as well as loan structuring  defeasance  and miscellaneous asset management fees 
table of contents associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
we recognize these forms of income when the fees are fixed or determinable  are evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
stock based compensation we have granted certain of our employees  directors  and employees of acm  stock awards consisting of shares of our common stock that vest immediately or annually over a multi year period  subject to the recipient continued service to us 
we record stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based award with subsequent remeasurement for any unvested shares granted to non employees 
such amounts are expensed against earnings  at the grant date for the portion that vests immediately or ratably over the respective vesting periods 
dividends are paid on restricted stock as dividends are paid on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested 
stock based compensation is disclosed in our consolidated statement of operations under employee compensation and benefits for employees and under selling and administrative expense for non employees 
income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of its taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
under current federal tax law  the income and the tax on such income attributable to certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in and have been deferred to future periods at our election 
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides clarity on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
hedging activities and derivatives hedging activities we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value and these amounts are recorded in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the fair value adjustments will affect either accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  or net income loss depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and  if so  the nature of the hedging activity 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
fair values are approximated based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
derivatives we record all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
additionally  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether a company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge 
table of contents accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
in the normal course of business  we may use a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
these derivative financial instruments must be effective in reducing its interest rate risk exposure in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income loss for each period until the derivative instrument matures or is settled 
any derivative instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked to market with the changes in value included in net income loss 
in cases where a derivative financial instrument is terminated early  any gain or loss is generally amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item 
during the year ended december   one basis swap matured with a notional value of approximately million  ten interest rate swaps matured with a combined notional value of approximately million and one interest rate cap matured with a notional value of approximately million 
in addition  the notional value on four basis swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements and the notional value on an interest rate swap decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreement 
in certain circumstances  we may finance the purchase of rmbs investments through a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty which may qualify as a linked transaction 
if both transactions are entered into contemporaneously or in contemplation of each other  the transactions are presumed to be linked transactions and we account for the purchase of such securities and the repurchase agreement on a combined basis as a forward contract derivative at fair value which is reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities underlying linked transactions and associated interest income and expense reported in other income on the consolidated statement of operations 
the analysis of transactions under these rules requires management judgment and experience 
during year ended december   we purchased rmbs investments which qualified as linked transactions 
the rmbs investments  net of their respective financing  had a total fair value at december  of million which is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we entered into a libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that was designated as a cash flow hedge and a libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that was not designated as a cash flow hedge 
in addition  the notional value on four basis swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements  the notional value on two interest rate swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements  and six interest rate swaps matured with a combined notional value of approximately million 
gains and losses on terminated swaps are deferred and recognized in interest expense over the original life of the hedged item 
the fair value of our qualifying hedge portfolio has increased by approximately million from december  as a result of the maturities and the amortized notional value of swaps  combined with a change in the projected libor rates and credit spreads of both parties 

table of contents because the valuations of our derivatives are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 
variable interest entities we have evaluated our loans and investments  mortgage related securities  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes  cdos and clo  in order to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities vies or as variable interests in vies 
this evaluation resulted in our determination that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes  cdos  clo and investments in debt securities were potential vies or variable interests in vies 
a vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors i do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  and or ii do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is defined as the party that i has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and ii has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we consolidate our cdo and clo subsidiaries  which qualify as vies  of which we are the primary beneficiary 
these cdos and clos invest in real estate and real estate related securities and are financed by the issuance of cdo and clo debt securities 
we  or one of our affiliates  is named collateral manager  servicer  and special servicer for all cdo and clo collateral assets which we believes gives us the power to direct the most significant economic activities of the entity 
we also have exposure to cdo and clo losses to the extent of our equity interests and also have rights to waterfall payments in excess of required payments to cdo and clo bond investors 
as a result of consolidation  equity interests in these cdos and clos have been eliminated  and the consolidated balance sheet reflects both the assets held and debt issued by the cdos and clos to third parties 
our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to cdo and clo assets and liabilities as opposed to our net economic interests in the cdo and clo entities 
as of december   we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of vies in which we have a variable interest 
these vies had an aggregate carrying amount of million and exposure to real estate debt of approximately billion at december  for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies or variable interests in vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies or variable interests in vies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties 
a liability fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor  not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity 

table of contents assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted and quoted prices exist in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets and liabilities carried at level fair value generally are government and agency securities  equities listed in active markets  investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument anticipated life 
level inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability  and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability 
fair valued assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are non government securities  municipal bonds  certain hybrid financial instruments  certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain commitments and guarantees  certain private equity investments and certain derivatives 
level inputs reflect management best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain private equity investments  certain municipal bonds  certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives 
determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including available for sale securities and derivative financial instruments 
the fair values of certain available for sale securities are approximated based on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
the fair values of available for sale equity securities traded in active markets are approximated using level inputs  while the fair values of certain available for sale debt securities that are approximated using current  non binding market quotes received from financial sources that trade such investments are valued using level inputs 
the fair values of certain cmbs and cdo securities are estimated by us using level inputs that require significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates  leasing  creditworthiness of major tenants  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  loan sponsorship  actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management 
in addition  fair values of interest rate swap derivatives are approximated using level inputs based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles including counterparty risks  credit spreads and interest rate projections  as well as reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
these items are included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments in the fair values of our derivative financial instruments to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk 
the fair values of forward contract derivatives are approximated using level inputs in internally developed valuation models  which are compared to current non binding market quotes for the underlying rmbs received from pricing services and financial sources that trade such investments 

table of contents at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we perform evaluations of our loans to determine if the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  which may result in an allowance and corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
these valuations require significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates  leasing  creditworthiness of major tenants  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  loan sponsorship  actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management 
in addition  real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less costs to sell 
measurement of fair value requires significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding cash flows  capitalization rates  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  and other factors deemed necessary by management as well as discussions with active market participants 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued updated guidance on disclosure about offsetting assets and liabilities which amends us gaap to conform more to the disclosure requirements of international financial reporting standards ifrs

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund additional cash collateral from potential declines in the value of a portion of our interest rate swaps  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from our operations 
our equity sources  depending on market conditions  consist of proceeds from capital market transactions including the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos and our new clos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes and borrowings under credit agreements 
net cash flows from operations include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from other investments reduced by expenses  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
a majority of our loans and investments are financed under existing debt obligations and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
while we have been successful in obtaining proceeds from two equity offerings and an atm offering  and from certain financing facilities to date  including our two clos  conditions in the capital and credit markets have and may continue to make certain forms of financing less attractive and  in certain cases  less available 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements

restrictive covenants our debt facilities contain various financial covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth  minimum liquidity and maximum debt balance requirements  as well as certain other debt service coverage ratios and debt to equity ratios 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions at december  our cdo and clo vehicles contain interest coverage and asset over collateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments 
if we fail these covenants in any of our cdos or clo  all cash flows from the applicable cdo or clo would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding cdo or clo bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that cdo or clo regained compliance with such tests 
our cdos and clo were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  as well as on the most recent determination date in january in the event of a breach of the cdo or clo covenants that could not be cured in the near term  we would be required to fund our non cdo or non clo expenses  including management fees and employee costs  distributions required to maintain

we have the right to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non performing loans out of the cdos or clo

to the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security  the asset principal balance for purposes of the overcollateralization test  is the lesser of the asset market value or the principal balance of the defaulted asset multiplied by the asset recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies 
rating downgrades of cdo and clo collateral will generally not have a direct impact on the principal balance of a cdo and clo asset for purposes of calculating the cdo and clo overcollateralization test unless the rating downgrade is below a significantly low threshold eg ccc as defined in each cdo and clo vehicle 
the interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us 
the chart below is a summary of the company cdo and clo overcollateralization ratios as of the following determination dates determination date cdo i cdo ii cdo iii clo i january october july april january

no payment due under the junior subordinated indentures may be paid if there is a default under any senior debt and the senior lender has sent notice to the trustee 
the junior subordinated indentures are also cross defaulted with each other 
cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds and maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
consequently  when making distributions in the past  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
since we have substantially reduced our short term debt  we may have to maintain adequate liquidity from operations to make any future distributions

table of contents management agreement we  arlp and arbor realty sr  inc have a management agreement with acm  pursuant to which acm provides certain services and we pay acm a base management fee and under certain circumstances  an annual incentive fee 
the base management fee is an arrangement whereby we reimburse acm for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true ups to actual costs 
the  and base management fees were million  million and million  respectively  and the base management fee is estimated to be approximately million 
all origination fees on investments are now retained by us 
the incentive fee is calculated as of the amount by which a our funds from operations per share  adjusted for certain gains and losses including gains from the retirement and restructuring of debt and of any loan loss reserve recoveries spread over a three year period  exceeds b the product of x per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  whichever is greater  and y the greater of or the weighted average of book value of the net assets contributed by acm to arlp per arlp partnership unit  the offering price per share of our common equity in the private offering on july  and subsequent offerings and the issue price per arlp partnership unit for subsequent contributions to arlp  multiplied by the weighted average of our outstanding shares 
the minimum return  or incentive fee hurdle  to be reached before an incentive fee is earned  is a percentage applied on a per share basis to the greater of or the average gross proceeds per share 
in addition  of any loan loss and other reserve recoveries are eligible to be included in the incentive fee calculation  which recoveries are spread over a three year period 
the management agreement also allows us to consider  from time to time  the payment of additional success based fees to acm for accomplishing certain specified corporate objectives  has a termination fee of million  and is renewable automatically for successive one year terms  unless terminated with six months prior written notice 
we incurred million  million and million of base management fees for services rendered in  and  respectively 
no success based payments were made for the years ended december   and the incentive fee is measured on an annual basis 
however  when applicable  we will pay the annual incentive fee in quarterly installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the twelve months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive fee are deemed to be an advance subject to potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year  and any overpayments are required to be repaid in accordance with the amended management agreement 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive fee is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive fee is being paid 
for the twelve month period ending december   acm earned an incentive management fee of million  which was included in due to related party as of december  as provided for in the management agreement  we offset the balance of a prepaid management fee receivable of million as of december   and acm elected to be paid the remaining incentive management fee in  shares of our common stock and million in cash  which was subsequently remitted in for the years ended december  and  acm did not earn an incentive management fee 
as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources repurchase agreements and credit facilities above  on june   we closed on the discounted payoff agreement with wachovia and retired all of our debt with wachovia at the discount described 
the successful completion of the 
table of contents retirement of the wachovia debt was a significant contributor to an incentive fee for the manager in above 
as indicated earlier  gains on the extinguishment of debt are included in the incentive fee calculation and the gain  net of fees  certain expenses  and taxes  attributable to the wachovia transaction was million 
additionally  in  acm received an incentive fee installment totaling million which was recorded as a prepaid management fee related to the incentive fee on million of deferred revenue recognized on the transfer of control of the west rd street property  one of our equity affiliates 
the incentive fee is accrued as it is earned 
the expense incurred for the incentive fee paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive fee paid to acm in the form of common stock in accordance with current accounting guidance  which discusses how to determine the expense when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  any expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the total incentive fee is determined 
in the event that the incentive fee for the full year is an amount less than the total of the installment payments made to acm for the year  acm will refund the amount of such overpayment to us in cash regardless of whether such installments were paid in cash or common stock 
in such a case  we would record a negative incentive fee expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined 
inflation changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant decline in interest rates in the past triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads on certain assets as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
the number of loans impacted by libor floors have significantly decreased over this time as a majority of the loans with such floors were paid off  monetized  modified or restructured 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

non gaap financial measures funds from operations we are presenting funds from operations ffo because we believe it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it is frequently used by analysts  investors and other parties in the evaluation of real estate investment trusts reits

we consider gains and losses on the sales of undepreciated real estate investments to be a normal part of our recurring operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be excluded when calculating ffo 
in accordance with the revised white paper  losses from discontinued operations are not excluded when calculating ffo 
ffo is not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or a measure of our liquidity  nor is it entirely indicative of funding our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
our calculation of ffo may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets have experienced disruptions in the past  which have and may in the future have an adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
in general  credit markets have experienced difficulty over the past several years 
however  of late  we have been able to access equity and debt markets through two equity offerings  an atm offering  a preferred stock offering and the issuance of two clos 
while there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the equity and debt markets  we will continue to pursue these and other available market opportunities as means to increase our liquidity and capital base 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction delays  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reducing the value of collateral  and a lack of liquidity in the market  could reduce the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
certain of these swaps are scheduled to mature on the original maturity dates of their corresponding loans 
however  loans are sometimes extended and  consequently  do not pay off on their original maturity dates 
if a loan is extended  whether it is through an existing extension option or 
table of contents a modification  our exposure to interest rate risk may be increased 
in these instances  we could have a fixed rate loan in our portfolio financed with variable debt and  since the corresponding interest swap already matured  a portion of our debt is no longer protected against interest rate risk 
some of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
also  in certain circumstances  we may finance the purchase of rmbs investments through a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty which may qualify as a linked transaction 
if both transactions are entered into contemporaneously or in contemplation of each other  the transactions are presumed to be linked transactions unless certain criteria are met  and we account for the purchase of such securities and the repurchase agreement on a combined basis as a forward contract derivative 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
one month libor approximated at december  and at december  based on our loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to a substantial portion of our portfolio having variable interest rates  partially offset by various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase

in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating 
table of contents results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in connection with our cdos described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
we had eight of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that had combined notional values of million as of december  compared to nine of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million as of december  the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million for both periods 
we also have interest rate swap agreements outstanding to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
we had of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that had a combined notional value of million as of december  compared to interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million as of december  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had two libor caps with a combined notional value of million as of december and if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of the libor caps would have increased by less than million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of the libor caps would have decreased by less than million for both periods 
we also had forward contracts due to recording the purchase of rmbs investments as linked transactions on a combined basis with the related repurchase financing  with a combined fair value of million as of december  we had no forward contracts as of december  as of december   assuming the balances of the securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million  and a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
certain of our interest rate swaps  which are designed to hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of our loans and investments  could require the funding of additional cash collateral for changes in the market value of these swaps 
due to the prolonged volatility in the financial markets that began in  the value of these interest rate swaps have declined substantially 
as a result  at december  and  we funded approximately million and million  respectively  in cash related to these swaps 
if we continue to experience significant changes in the outlook of interest rates  these contracts could continue to decline in value  which would require additional cash to be 
table of contents funded 
however  at maturity the value of these contracts return to par and all cash will be recovered 
if we do not have available cash to meet these requirements  this could result in the early termination of these interest rate swaps  leaving us exposed to interest rate risk associated with these loans and investments  which could adversely impact our financial condition 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies
