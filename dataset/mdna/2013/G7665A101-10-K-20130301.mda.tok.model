item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview operating results from continuing operations for reflected the full year effect of the addition to our fleet of seven newly constructed high specification jack up rigs  including three exl class rigs and three n class rigs in  and the joe douglas c class rig in early demand for drilling equipment continues to be bifurcated based on rig capabilities 
utilization of our high specification jack ups for was  compared to and for our premium and conventional jack ups  respectively 
in utilization of our high specification jack ups was  compared to and for our premium and conventional jack ups  respectively 
we define high specification jack ups as those that have hook load capacity of at least two million pounds and premium jack ups as those cantilevered rigs capable of operating in water depths of feet or more 
revenues for increased by over to billion as a result of the rig additions and higher utilization and day rates for existing rigs 
net income from continuing operations increased by to million 
included in pretax earnings for was a loss on debt extinguishment of million million after tax 
for  we recognized an income tax benefit of million on million of pretax income from continuing operations as compared to a benefit of million on million of pretax income from continuing operations in the recognition of income tax benefits in and were due in part to the amortization of benefits related to outbounding certain rigs to our non us subsidiaries in prior years  and with respect to  the implementation of tax planning strategies with regard to capitalized interest 
also impacting taxes in and were the removal of the company s manufacturing and land drilling operations  whose earnings were subject to a us statutory rate  and a significant proportion of income earned in lower tax jurisdictions 
we are currently projecting a effective income tax expense rate in the single digits 
in we entered into contracts with hyundai heavy industries co  ltd hyundai for the construction of three ultra deepwater drillships  the rowan renaissance  rowan resolute and rowan reliance  which are scheduled for delivery from the shipyard in december  june and october  respectively 
in we exercised our option with hyundai for the construction of a fourth ultra deepwater drillship  the rowan relentless  which is scheduled for delivery in march the agreement with hyundai also includes an option for a similar fifth drillship exercisable in the first quarter of  for delivery in the third quarter of we may seek to extend the option prior to its termination 
as of february   the date of our most recent fleet status report  we had six jack ups in the north sea  eleven in the middle east  seven in the us gom  three in malaysia  two in trinidad and one each in egypt and indonesia 
as of that date  ten of our rigs had drilling contracts estimated to be completed in  twelve had contracts estimated to be completed in  six had contracts estimated to be completed in through  and three were available 
additionally  the rowan renaissance has a three year contract for initial work in west africa that is expected to commence in the first quarter of following its delivery from the shipyard 
results of operations our profitability is primarily a function of our ability to keep our rigs under contract and the operating day rates received  but is also impacted by the level of downtime while a rig is under contract 
the company typically receives a reduced day rate or no day rate during periods of downtime 
our ability to obtain contracts for our rigs and the day rates received are primarily determined by the level of oil and gas exploration and development expenditures  which are heavily influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices and the availability of competitive equipment 
when drilling markets are strengthening  day rates generally lag the upward trend in rig utilization  and day rate increases can be more significant as utilization approaches or more 
when drilling markets are weakening  contractors often reduce day rates in an effort to maintain utilization 
both rig utilization and day rates have historically declined much faster than they have risen 
our average utilization and day rates by rig classification are presented below 
table of contents utilization high specification jack up premium jack up conventional jack up average day rate high specification jack up premium jack up conventional jack up utilization is the number of revenue producing days divided by the aggregate number of days rigs were available to work 
we define high specification jack ups as those that have hook load capacity of at least two million pounds 
we define premium jack ups as those cantilevered rigs capable of operating in water depths of feet or more 
average day rate is computed by dividing day rate revenues by the number of revenue producing days 
current operations and markets worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied among geographic markets  as has the supply of competitive equipment 
exploration and development expenditures can be impacted by many local factors  such as political and regulatory policies  seasonal weather patterns  lease expirations  new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion 
over time  the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are the principal determinants of drilling activity  and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities 
our primary drilling markets are currently the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea  southeast asia  middle east and us gom 
we also have rigs operating in trinidad and egypt 
as demand shifts among geographic areas  the company may from time to time relocate rigs from one major geographic area to another 
during and  we completed the following major strategic repositionings from to rowan mississippi us gom middle east rowan gorilla ii us gom malaysia rowan gorilla iii us gom trinidad jp bussell egypt vietnam ralph coffman us gom egypt rowan exl i us gom indonesia rowan exl iv us gom malaysia the relocation of rigs is a significant undertaking  and often interrupts revenues and cash flows for several months  particularly when equipment upgrades are involved 
thus  major relocations are typically carried out only when the likelihood of higher long term returns outweighs the short term costs 
the north sea is a mature  harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment 
project lead times are often lengthy  and drilling assignments  which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures  can range from several months to several years 
drilling activity and day rates in the north sea move slowly in response to market conditions  and generally follow trends in oil prices 
as of february   industry utilization for jack up rigs in the north sea was  and we had six rigs in the uk and norwegian sectors with expected contract completion dates ranging from through the middle east is a market in which we have had a stable presence in recent years 
as of february   industry utilization in the middle east for jack up rigs was  and we had eight rigs under contract in saudi arabia  two rigs under 
table of contents contract in qatar and one stacked rig in sharjah  united arab emirates 
eight of our ten rigs working there have contracts estimated to complete in  one has a contract estimated complete in and the other has a contract estimated to complete in the us gom jack up drilling market is highly fragmented among many participants  many of which are independent operators whose drilling activities may be highly dependent on near term operating cash flows 
a typical drilling assignment may call for days of exploration or development work performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options 
long term contracts for jack up rigs have been relatively rare  and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators 
jack up drilling demand and day rates in the us gom have tended to move quickly and generally follow trends in natural gas prices 
demand in the shallow waters of the us gom has been relatively weak over the last few years as a result of large supplies of natural gas and relatively low prices 
as of february   industry utilization for jack up rigs in the us gom was  and we had seven rigs there four under contracts estimated to complete in  one estimated to complete in and two that were stacked 
in late  we reentered the southeast asia market after a long absence and currently have four rigs working there three in malaysia including the jp bussell  which worked in vietnam for most of prior to relocating to malaysia in late and one in indonesia 
we see increasing opportunities in southeast asia due to a strong regional economy  a growing emphasis on higher specification rigs and strong interest in contractors with high pressure high temperature well experience 
industry utilization for jack up rigs in southeast asia was at february  three of our rigs there have contracts estimated to complete in and one has a contract estimated to complete in

as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has chosen not to separately disclose cash flows pertaining to discontinued operations in its statement of cash flows  as permitted under us gaap 
operating cash flows for were positively impacted by the addition of seven newbuild rigs to the fleet in and cash flows from operations for benefited from long term contracts entered into in earlier years when rates were significantly higher 
the company has not provided deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of the company s non uk subsidiaries  including rowan delaware and rowan delaware s non us subsidiaries 
it is the company s policy and intention to permanently reinvest earnings of the non us subsidiaries of rowan delaware outside the non us the earnings of non uk subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of rowan delaware can be distributed to rowan uk without imposition of either uk or local country tax 
as of december   unremitted earnings of rowan delaware were approximately  million  and unremitted earnings of rowan delaware s non us subsidiaries were approximately million 
should non us subsidiaries of rowan delaware make a distribution from these earnings  we may be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of a deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings  and rowan delaware has no plan to distribute earnings in a manner that would cause those earnings to be subject to us  us or other local country taxation 
at december   rowan delaware and rowan delaware s non us subsidiaries held approximately million and million  respectively  of the billion of consolidated cash and cash equivalents 
the company has significant net assets  liquidity  contract backlog and or other financial resources available to meet its operational and capital investment

reference should be made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for the status of our newbuild rig projects 
capital expenditures in totaled million and included the following million towards construction of the ultra deepwater drillships rowan renaissance  rowan resolute  rowan reliance and rowan relentless  million for improvements to the existing fleet  including contractually required modifications  and million for rig equipment inventory and other 
we currently estimate our capital expenditures to be approximately billion  including million towards construction of the four ultra deepwater drillships  million for life enhancement projects and existing fleet maintenance capital  million for partially reimbursed contractual modifications to the jack up fleet  and million for equipment spares  drill pipe and improvements to our shore bases 
the capital budget reflects an appropriation of money that we may or may not spend  and the timing of such expenditures may change 
we will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecasted cash flows and liquidity  anticipated market conditions in our business  the availability of financing sources  and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value 
certain such adjustments would require board approval 
we expect to fund our newbuild drillship program and other capital expenditures from available cash  cash flows from operations  amounts available under our revolving credit facility  if required  and potential future financings 
financing activities in april  the us department of transportation maritime administration marad  which had previously guaranteed certain of the company s debt securities under the title xi federal ship financing program the title xi notes  denied the company s request for consent with respect to a parent company guarantee in connection with the company s redomestication

annual interest payments on the senior notes total million 
no principal payments are required until each series final maturity date 
management believes that cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy all of the company s cash requirements for the following months 
our debt agreements contain provisions that limit the amount of long term debt  limit the ability of the company to create liens that secure debt  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate with another company and  in the event of noncompliance  restrict investment activities and asset purchases and sales  among other things 
additionally  the revolving credit facility agreement provides that the facility will not be available in the event of a material adverse change in the company s condition  operations  business  assets  liabilities or ability to perform 
the company was in compliance with its debt covenants at december   and expects to remain in compliance throughout cash dividends restrictive provisions in the company s debt agreements require the company to maintain a minimum level of shareholders equity equal to no less than the of the book value of outstanding debt 
the payment of future dividends  if any  would only be paid at the discretion of the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or  other than operating lease obligations and other commitments in the ordinary course of business 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   including obligations recognized on our balance sheet and those not required to be recognized in millions 
table of contents payments due by period total within year to years to years after years long term debt  including interest newbuild construction contracts purchase obligations operating leases total we periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses  and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at december  pension obligations minimum contributions under defined benefit pension plans are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve  among other things  assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates 
similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements see critical accounting policies and management estimates pension and other postretirement benefits 
as of december   our financial statements reflected an aggregate unfunded pension liability of million 
we expect to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in  and we will continue to make significant pension contributions over the next several years 
additional funding may be required if pension asset values decline 
contingent liabilities we are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our businesses and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters 
the company believes that there are no known contingencies  claims or lawsuits that could have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and management estimates our significant accounting policies are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
these policies and management judgments  assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve carrying values of long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations  and income taxes particularly our estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions  as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment  primarily our drilling rigs  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
potential impairment indicators include rapid declines in commodity prices  stock prices  day rates and utilization  among others 
the offshore drilling industry has historically been highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for extended periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles improve 
similarly  during periods of excess supply  rigs may be contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods 
impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs  groups of rigs  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or rigs in a certain geographic region 
our rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from regions with excess supply  if economically feasible 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
in most instances  they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs and are based on management judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations  as well as management estimates of future expected utilization  contract rates  expense levels and capital requirements of our drilling rigs 
the estimates  judgments and assumptions used by management in the application of our asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational  industry  market  economic and political environments 
the use of different estimates  judgments  assumptions and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different asset carrying values and operating results 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events  including long term asset returns  interest rates  annual compensation increases  mortality rates and other factors 
key assumptions at december   included weighted average discount rates of and used to determine pension benefit obligations and net cost  respectively  an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from in to in and beyond 
the assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for moody s aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease increase in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase decrease annual net benefits cost by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase other postretirement benefit cost by million 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the plans other asset classes and the expectations for future returns of each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon the current asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the plan  which was maintained at at december   unchanged from december  income taxes in accordance with accounting guidelines for income tax uncertainties  we evaluate each tax position to determine if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based on its merits 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in income for the period  and a reserve  if any 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by us federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
determinations by such taxing authorities that differ materially from our recorded estimates  either favorably or unfavorably  may have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we believe our reserve for uncertain tax positions totaling million at december   is properly recorded in accordance with the accounting guidelines 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our outstanding debt at december   consisted entirely of fixed rate debt with a carrying value of billion and a weighted average annual interest rate of 
due to the fixed rate nature of our debt  management believes the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates is not material 
the majority of our transactions are denominated in united states dollars 
our primary exposure to currency exchange is the british pound 
in order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  we generally require customer payments to be in us dollars and generally limit local currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in local currencies 
in certain countries in which we operate however such as egypt  local laws or contracts may require us to receive payment for a portion of the contract in the local currency 
in such instances  we may hold a greater amount of local currency than would otherwise be the case 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposure 
fluctuating commodity prices affect our future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for our products and services 
as a general practice  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
