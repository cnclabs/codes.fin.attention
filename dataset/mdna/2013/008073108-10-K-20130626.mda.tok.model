item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein as item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
refer to forward looking statements on page and risk factors beginning on page  for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview we design  develop  produce  support and operate a technologically advanced portfolio of products 
we supply unmanned aircraft systems  or uas  tactical missile systems and services primarily to organizations within the us department of defense  or dod 
we also supply charging systems and services for electric vehicles and power cycling and test systems to commercial  consumer and government customers 
we derive the majority of our revenue from these business areas and we believe that the markets for these solutions have significant growth potential 
additionally  we believe that some of the innovative potential products in our research and development pipeline will emerge as new growth platforms in the future  creating additional market opportunities 
the success we have achieved with our current products and services stems from our investment in research and development and our ability to invent and deliver advanced solutions  utilizing our proprietary technologies  to help our government  commercial and consumer customers operate more effectively and efficiently 
we develop these highly innovative solutions by working very closely with our key customers in each segment of our business and solving their most important challenges related to our areas of expertise 
our core technological capabilities  developed through more than years of innovation  include lightweight aerostructures  power electronics  electric propulsion systems  efficient electric power generation  conversion  and storage systems  high density energy packaging  miniaturization  digital data links  aircraft payloads  controls integration  systems integration and engineering optimization coupled with professional field service capabilities 

table of contents our uas business segment focuses primarily on the design  development  production  support and operation of innovative uas and tactical missile systems that provide situational awareness  multi band communications  force protection and other mission effects to increase the security and effectiveness of our customers operations 
our efficient energy systems  or ees  business segment focuses primarily on the design  development  production  marketing  support and operation of innovative efficient electric energy systems that address the growing demand for electric transportation solutions 
revenue we generate our revenue primarily from the sale  support and operation of our small uas  electric vehicle charging systems and power cycling and test systems solutions 
support for our small uas customers includes training  spare parts  product repair  product replacement  and the customer contracted operation of our small uas by our personnel 
we refer to these support activities collectively as our services operation 
we derive most of our small uas revenue from fixed price and cost plus fee contracts with the us government  and most of our electric vehicle charging systems and power cycling and test systems revenue from sales and service to commercial customers 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of direct costs and allocated indirect costs 
direct costs include labor  materials  travel  subcontracts and other costs directly related to the execution of a specific contract 
indirect costs include overhead expenses  fringe benefits and other costs that are not directly charged to a specific contract 
gross margin gross margin is equal to revenue minus cost of sales 
we use gross margin as a financial metric to help us understand trends in our direct costs and allocated indirect costs when compared to the revenue we generate 
research and development expense research and development  or r d  is an integral part of our business model 
we conduct significant internally funded research and development and anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
our research and development activities focus specifically on creating capabilities that support our existing product portfolio as well as new solutions 
these activities are funded both externally by customers and internally 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  include salaries and other expenses related to selling  marketing and proposal activities  and other administrative costs 
sg a is an important financial metric that we analyze to help us evaluate the contribution of our selling  marketing and proposal activities to revenue generation 
other income and expenses other income and expenses includes interest income  interest expense and changes in fair value of certain financial investments 

table of contents income tax expense our effective tax rates are substantially lower than the statutory rates primarily due to research and development tax credits 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition  inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence  self insured liabilities  accounting for stock based awards  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our organization and significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
we believe that there are two key factors which impact the reliability of management estimates 
the first of those key factors is that the terms of our contracts are typically less than six months 
the short term nature of such contracts reduces the risk that material changes in accounting estimates will occur on the basis of market conditions or other factors 
the second key factor is that we have hundreds of contracts in any given accounting period  which reduces the risk that any one change in an accounting estimate on one or several contracts would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or our two reporting segments measures of profit 
the substantial majority of our revenue is generated pursuant to written contractual arrangements to design  develop  manufacture and or modify complex products  and to provide related engineering  technical and other services according to customer specifications 
these contracts may be fixed price or cost reimbursable 
we consider all contracts for treatment in accordance with authoritative guidance for contracts with multiple deliverables 
revenue from product sales not under contractual arrangement is recognized at the time title and the risk and rewards of ownership pass  which typically occurs when the products are shipped and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents revenue and profits on fixed price contracts are recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
revenue and profits on fixed price production contracts  whose units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process  are recorded as units are delivered based on their selling prices  or the units of delivery method 
revenue and profits on other fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract  or the cost to cost method 
under percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance  which can exceed one year 
accounting for revenue and profits on a fixed price contract requires the preparation of estimates of the total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract statement of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion 
under the units of delivery method  sales on a fixed price type contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period based on their contractual selling prices 
under the cost to cost method  sales on a fixed price type contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by a the total estimated contract revenue  less b the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units of delivery method or cost to cost method is equal to x the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized  less y the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract 
in the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenue  a loss arises  and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that it becomes evident 
the unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded in the program cost 
revenue and profits on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as costs are incurred on the contract  at an amount equal to the costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract is generally fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete at least quarterly and in many cases more frequently 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract revenue  estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates for all types of contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
during the fiscal years ended april   and  changes in accounting estimates on fixed price contracts recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting were not material to our consolidated financial statements or our two reporting segments measure of profit 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
inventories and reserve for excess and obsolescence our policy for valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 

table of contents self insured liability we are self insured for employee medical claims  subject to individual and aggregate stop loss policies 
we estimate a liability for claims filed and incurred but not reported based upon recent claims experience and an analysis of the average period of time between the occurrence of a claim and the time it is reported to and paid by us 
we perform an annual evaluation of this policy and have determined that for all prior years during which this policy has been in effect there have been cost advantages to this policy  as compared to obtaining commercially available employee medical insurance 
however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance  and may differ from actual cash flows 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
long term incentive awards we grant long term incentive awards and we establish a target payout at the beginning of each performance period 
the actual payout at the end of the performance period is calculated based upon our achievement of revenue and operating profit growth targets 
payouts are made in cash and restricted stock units 
upon vesting of the restricted stock units  we have the discretion to settle the restricted stock units in cash or stock 
the cash component of the award is accounted for as a liability 
the equity component is accounted for as a stock based liability as the restricted stock units may be settled in cash or stock 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets 
the estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are revised 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes  which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we currently have significant deferred assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends on our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors  which may result in recording a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
fiscal periods our fiscal year ends on april due to our fixed year end date of april  our first and fourth quarters each consist of approximately weeks 
the second and third quarters each consist of weeks 
our first three quarters end on a saturday

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  accrued expenses and ongoing research and development costs  all of which we anticipate funding through our existing working capital and funds provided by operating activities 
the majority of our purchase obligations are pursuant to funded contractual arrangements with our customers 
in addition  we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property  plant and equipment  and we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  if any  during the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  then we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures or obtain additional financing 
the current challenging economic environment continues to create volatility and disruption in the capital markets  diminished liquidity and credit availability  and increased counterparty risk 
nevertheless  we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital  investing in capital expenditures  supporting product development efforts  introducing new products and enhancing existing products  and marketing acceptance and adoption of our products and services 
our future capital requirements  to a certain extent  are also subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense and electric vehicle industries and are subject to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors that are beyond our control 
moreover  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations  and cash from short term borrowing are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investment in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
our working capital requirements vary by contract type 
on cost plus fee programs  we typically bill our incurred costs and fees monthly as work progresses  and therefore working capital investment is minimal 
on fixed price contracts  we typically are paid as we deliver products  and working capital is needed to fund labor and expenses incurred during the lead time from contract award until contract deliveries begin 
cash flows the following table provides our cash flow data as of fiscal year ended april  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million to million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower working capital needs of million  lower deferred income taxes of million  higher depreciation expense of million  partially offset by lower income of million 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended april  decreased by million to million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher working capital needs of million  no impairment of long lived assets of million  and lower depreciation expense of million  partially offset by higher income of million 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower capital expenditures of million and net redemption of us government securities and municipal bonds of million  partially offset by the purchase of convertible bonds of million 
during the fiscal years ended april   and  we used cash to purchase property and equipment totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net purchases of us treasury bills and municipal bonds of million and higher capital expenditures of million 
during the fiscal years ended april   and  we used cash to purchase property and equipment totaling million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  the decrease was primarily due to lower exercises of stock options of million and lower excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of million 
net cash provided by financing activities remained at million for the fiscal years ended april  and contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of april  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total consists of all cancelable and non cancelable purchase orders as of april  off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec regulation s k 

table of contents inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in our material and labor costs 
new accounting standards on may   we adopted changes in accordance with guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which requires companies to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we elected to adopt the two statement option 
the new guidance eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
other than the change in presentation  the adoption of these changes had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented  which was indefinitely deferred in december of in february of  the fasb issued guidance related to the reclassification adjustments and related adoption date  we will adopt the guidance regarding reclassification adjustments on may  other than the change in presentation  the adoption of these changes will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on may   we adopted changes in accordance with guidance issued by the fasb to provide a consistent definition of fair value and to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
the new guidance changed certain fair value measurement principles and enhanced the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
the adoption of these changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
foreign currency exchange rate risk since a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains or losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant foreign exchange gains or losses in the future 
we occasionally engage in forward contracts in foreign currencies to limit our exposure on non us dollar transactions
