item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents company risks if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technologies  our royalty revenue may not grow and could decline 
our revenue growth is largely dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new or renewed licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new or renewed licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding  and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the competition we may face from third parties and or the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  difficulties in persuading existing licensees of our software technologies incorporated in certain of their products to additionally license our patents that may cover products that do not include our software technologies  challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies and challenges associated with customers ability to easily implement our technologies  difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the additional bill of materials costs necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  difficulties in obtaining new licensees for yet to be commercialized technology because their suppliers may not be ready to meet stringent quality and parts availability requirements  inability to sign new gaming licenses if video console makers choose not to license third parties to make peripherals for their new consoles  if video console makers no longer require peripherals to play video games  if video console makers no longer utilize technology in the peripherals that are covered by our patents or if the overall market for video consoles deteriorates substantially  reluctance of content developers  mobile device manufacturers  and service providers to sign license agreements without a critical mass of other such inter dependent supporters of the mobile device industry also having a license  or without enough similar devices in the market that incorporate our technologies  and inability of current or prospective licensees to ship certain mobile devices if they are involved in ip infringement claims by third parties that ultimately prevent them from shipping products or that impose substantial royalties on their products 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of major customers could harm our operating results 
one customer accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  two customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to generate revenue in any future period 
if we fail to renew or lose a major customer or group of customers  our revenue could decline if we are unable to replace the lost revenue with revenue from other sources 

table of contents future revenue is difficult to predict for several reasons  and our failure to predict revenue accurately may cause our results to be below our expectations or those of analysts and result in our stock price declining 
our lengthy and costly license negotiation cycle and any ip litigation that we may engage in make our future revenue difficult to predict because we may not be successful in entering into or renewing licenses with our customers on our estimated timelines  and we may be reliant on litigation timelines  which are difficult to control for any results or settlements 
while some of our license agreements provide for fixed royalty payments  many of our license agreements provide for per unit royalties  and may also be subject to adjustments based on volume 
the sales volume and prices of our licensees products in any given period can be difficult to predict 
as a result  our actual results may differ substantially from analyst estimates or our forecasts in any given period 
in addition  a portion of our revenue comes from development and support services provided to our licensees  or may be part of a contractual arrangement involving multiple elements 
depending upon the nature of the services or elements  all or a portion of the revenue may be recognized ratably over the support period or length of the contract  may be recognized according to the proportional performance accounting method under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  or may be deferred in part or in whole 
contract revenue accounting may result in deferral of the service fees to the completion of the contract or may cause the services fees to be recognized over the period in which services are performed on a proportional performance basis and  therefore  product development schedules for these projects may be changed or delayed 
all of these factors make it difficult to predict future licensing revenue and may result in our revenue being below our previously announced guidance or analysts estimates  which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
we are currently involved in litigation and administrative proceedings involving some of our key patents  any invalidation or limitation of the scope of our key patents could significantly harm our business 
as more fully described under legal proceedings  we are currently involved in litigation involving some of our patents 
the parties in these legal actions have challenged the validity  scope  enforceability and ownership of our patents 
in addition  reexamination requests have been filed in the us patent and trademark office pto with respect to patent claims at issue in our litigation proceedings 
under a reexamination proceeding and upon completion of the proceeding  the pto may leave a patent in its present form  narrow the scope of the patent or cancel some or all of the claims of the patent 
we are currently asserting these patents and patent claims in litigation 
if some or all of the claims of the patents that are subject to reexamination are canceled  our business may be significantly harmed 
we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation or reexaminations 
if there is an adverse ruling in any legal or administrative proceeding relating to the infringement  validity  enforceability or ownership of any of our patents  or if a court or an administrative body such as the pto limits the scope of the claims of any of our patents  we could be prevented from enforcing or earning future revenues from those patents  and the likelihood that customers will take new licenses and that current licensees will continue to agree to pay under their existing licenses could be significantly reduced 
the resulting reduction in license fees and royalties could significantly harm our business  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  or the trading price of our common stock 
furthermore  regardless of the merits of any claim  the continued maintenance of these legal and administrative proceedings may result in substantial legal expenses and diverts our management s time and attention away from our other business operations  which could significantly harm our business 
the time to resolution and complexity of our litigation  its disproportionate importance to our business compared to other companies  the propensity for delay in patent litigation  and the potential that we may lose particular motions as 
table of contents well as the overall litigation all could cause significant volatility in our stock price and materially adversely affect our business and consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and we expect to continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights to our technology and under our ip 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
we refer to the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including  but not limited to  field of use definitions  market sector  and product category definitions  collectively as license provisions 
due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories  and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different from our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to claims that we have granted rights to one licensee that are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee 
many of our customers report royalties to us based on their shipments or their revenues and their interpretation and allocation of contracted royalty rates 
it is possible that the originally reported royalties could differ materially from those determined by either a customer self reported correction or from an audit we have performed 
these interpretations may also cause disagreements arising during customer audits  may lead to claims or litigation of those claims  and may have an adverse affect on the results of our operations 
further  although our agreements generally give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees  audits can be expensive  time consuming  and may not be cost justified based on our understanding of our licensees businesses 
pursuant to our license compliance program  we audit certain licensees to review the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements  but we cannot give assurances that such audits will be effective 
in addition  after we enter into an agreement  it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that we did not foresee or was not foreseeable at the time we entered into the agreement 
as a result  in any agreement  we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
competing technologies may harm our business 
our biggest source of competition derives from decisions made by internal design groups at our oem customers and potential oem customers 
we expect that these internal design groups will continue to make choices regarding whether to implement haptics or not  whether to use our solutions or other standard haptic capability ie  android  or even whether to develop their own haptic solutions 
in the instances where the design team elects not to use our solution but implements some type of unlicensed haptic capability  we will seek to enforce our ip 
if the oem is unwilling to enter into a license agreement  we may elect to pursue litigation which would harm our relationship with the oem and could harm our relationships with other licensees or our ability to gain new customers  who may postpone licensing decisions pending the outcome of the litigation or dispute  or who may  as a result of such litigation  choose not to adopt our technologies 
in addition  these legal proceedings could be very expensive and will have a negative impact on our financial results 
in the event we have granted or grant a license to our patent portfolio to an oem  its internal design group may design technology that is less expensive to implement or that enables products with higher performance or additional features 
many of these groups have substantially greater resources  greater financial strength and lower cost structures which may allow them to undercut our price 
they also have the inherent advantage of 
table of contents access to internal corporate strategies  technology roadmaps and technical information 
as a result  they may be able to bring alternative solutions to market more easily and quickly 
in some cases  the oem may elect not to include haptics in its products due to the higher bill of materials costs associated with incorporating haptics 
in addition to licensing oems directly  our business also includes licensing to semiconductor manufacturers who incorporate certain of our lower tiered technology in their integrated circuits for use in certain electronic devices 
while our relationships with these semiconductor manufacturers increases our distribution channels by leveraging their sales channels  it is possible that oems may elect to implement haptics using the integrated circuit lower tiered solution rather than our higher end solutions which may negatively impact our financial results 
winning business is subject to a competitive selection process that can be lengthy and requires us to incur significant expense  and we may not be selected 
our primary focus is on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  so that haptics will be included in our customers products 
these selection processes can be lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
because we typically focus on only a few customers in a product area  the loss of a design win can sometimes result in our failure to have haptics added to new generation products in that area 
this can result in lost sales and could hurt our position in future competitive selection processes to the extent we are not be perceived as being a technology leader 
after winning a product design for one of our customers  we may still experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development and design cycle 
in addition  a change  delay or cancellation of a customer s plans could significantly adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue 
finally  if our customers fail to successfully market and sell their products it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
automobiles and medical devices incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive automotive and medical devices royalties 
the product development process for automobiles and medical devices is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we may not earn royalty revenue on our automotive medical devices technologies unless and until products featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with a manufacturer or a supplier to a manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that a manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its products  making it difficult for us to predict the royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle  the option packages if our technology is an option for example  a navigation unit  or medical device  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 
we have little or no control or influence on our licensees design  manufacturing  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our ip to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december    and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality 
table of contents control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees  nor can we control consolidation within an industry which could either reduce the number of licensing products available or reduce royalty rates for the combined licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technologies in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance  or otherwise generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
if our licensees products fail to achieve commercial success or if products are recalled because of quality control problems or if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
since  we have incurred losses in all but six quarters 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we need to generate significant ongoing revenue to achieve and maintain consistent profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur expenses as we continue to develop our technologies  increase our sales and marketing efforts  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled technologies and products  protect and enforce our ip  pursue strategic relationships  incur costs related to pending and anticipated litigation  acquire ip or other assets from third parties  and invest in systems and processes to manage our business 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have limited engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance and operations resources to design and fulfill favorable product delivery schedules and to provide support of our different product areas 
products and services may not be delivered in a timely way  with sufficient levels of quality  or at all  which may reduce our revenue 
we deploy our limited engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance  and operations resources on a variety of different projects and programs intended to provide sufficient levels of quality necessary for channels and customers 
our success in various markets may depend on timely deliveries and overall levels of sustained quality and customer service 
our failure to provide favorable product and program deliverables and quality and customer service levels  or provide them at all  may disrupt channels and customers  harm our brand  and reduce our revenues 
our business depends in part on access to third party platforms or technologies  and if the access is withdrawn  denied  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  or if the platforms or technologies change without notice to us  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
many of our current and future products are designed for use with third party platforms or technologies 
our business in these categories relies on our access to the platforms or technologies of third parties  which can be withdrawn  denied or not be available on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents our access to third party platforms or technologies may require paying a royalty  which lowers our product margins  or may otherwise be on terms that are not acceptable to us 
in addition  the third party platforms or technologies used to interact with our product portfolio can be delayed in production or can change without prior notice to us  which can result lost sales or lower margins 
if we are unable to access third party platforms or technologies  or if our access is withdrawn  denied  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  or if the platforms or technologies are delayed or change without notice to us  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets has previously declined and may further do so if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license including sublicense rights to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services  excluding specified products  covered by our patents 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled console gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as mobile devices and tablets 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than some of our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments may decline 
the market for certain touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for certain of our touch enabling technologies and certain of our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for our touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions  or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees  component customers  and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers and content producers to create products that utilize our technologies 
negative product reviews or publicity about our company  our technologies  our licensees products  haptic features  or haptic technology in general could have a negative impact on market adoption  our revenue  and or our ability to license our technologies in the future 
we may not be able to continue to derive significant revenues from makers of peripherals for popular video gaming platforms 
a significant portion of our gaming royalty revenues come from third party peripheral makers who make licensed gaming products designed for use with popular video game console systems from microsoft  sony  and nintendo 
video game console systems are closed  proprietary systems  and video game console system makers typically impose certain requirements or restrictions on third party peripheral makers who wish to make peripherals that will be compatible with a particular video game console system 
if third party peripheral makers cannot or are not allowed to obtain or satisfy these requirements or restrictions  our gaming royalty revenues 
table of contents could be significantly reduced 
furthermore  should a significant video game console maker choose to omit touch enabling capabilities from its console systems or somehow restrict or impede the ability of third parties to make touch enabling peripherals  it may very well lead our gaming licensees to stop making products with touch enabling capabilities  thereby significantly reducing our gaming royalty revenues 
also  if the gaming industry changes such that mobile or other platforms increase in popularity at the expense of traditional video game consoles  our gaming royalty revenues could be substantially reduced if we are unable to enter into replacement arrangements enabling us to license our ip in connection with gaming on such mobile or other platforms 
if we fail to protect and enforce our ip rights  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our ip rights and by customers selling products that incorporate our technologies 
we rely on our significant patent portfolio to protect our proprietary rights 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court or patent office were to limit the scope  declare unenforceable  or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments  or they may choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country  particularly in asia  where we or our licensees do business 
in addition  our patents will continue to expire according to their terms  with expiration dates starting in our failure to continuously develop or acquire successful innovations and obtain patents on those innovations could significantly harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements  other contractual agreements  and copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our patented technologies  trademarks  and other proprietary rights would be difficult  expensive  and time consuming  within and particularly outside of the united states of america 
our business may suffer if third parties assert that we violate their ip rights 
third parties have previously claimed and may in the future claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their ip rights 
even if we believe that such claims are without merit  they can be time consuming and costly to defend against and will divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
furthermore  third parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or services in the us and abroad 
claims of ip infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards 
even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to perform its contractual obligations under the agreement 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technologies and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification 
table of contents may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms  or substitute similar technology from another source  our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows could suffer 
recent changes to us patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the us pto may adversely impact our business 
our business relies in part on the uniform and historically consistent application of us patent laws and regulations 
there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the pto  which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our ip rights 
for example  on september   president obama signed the leahy smith america invents act which codifies significant changes to the us patent laws  including  among other things  changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system  limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  replacing interference proceedings with derivation actions and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have been issued 
the effects of these changes on our patent portfolio and business have yet to be determined  as the pto must still implement regulations relating to these changes and the courts have yet to address the new provisions 
in addition  in recent years  the courts have interpreted us patent laws and regulations differently  and in particular the us supreme court has decided a number of patent cases and continues to actively review more patent cases than it has in the past 
some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous for us  and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our patents against parties using them without a license or payment of royalties 
these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights  and could have a deleterious effect on our licensing program and  therefore  the royalties we can collect 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete  and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licenses and royalties from a relatively small number of key technologies 
we devote significant engineering resources to develop new technologies to address the evolving needs of our customers 
to remain competitive  we must introduce new technologies in a timely manner and the market must adopt them 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful or timely 
any new or enhanced technologies  such as our integrator product  may not be favorably received by our licensees or consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technologies could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial  and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current technologies may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to achieve revenue growth also depends on our continuing ability to improve and reduce the cost of our technologies  to improve their ease of integration in both hardware and software  and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent their widespread adoption 
mobile devices  tablets  touchscreens  personal computer and console gaming peripherals  and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies can be more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although many oems have licensed our technologies  there is generally no commitment on their part to use our technologies in their devices 
the greater expense of development and production of products containing our touch enabling technologies  together with the higher price to the end customer  may be a significant barrier to their widespread adoption and sale 

table of contents if we are unable to develop open source compliant products  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
we have seen  and believe that we will continue to see  an increase in customers requesting that we develop products that will operate in an open source environment 
developing open source compliant products  without imperiling the ip rights upon which our licensing business depends  may prove difficult under certain circumstances  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage for new product designs 
as a result  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the uncertain economic environment could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current economic conditions could materially hurt our business in a number of ways  including longer sales and renewal cycles  delays in adoption of our products or technologies  increased risk of competition  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  delays in signing or failing to sign customer agreements  or signing customer agreements with reduced royalty rates 
in addition  our customers  potential customers  and business partners are facing similar challenges  which could materially and adversely affect the level of business they conduct with us or in the level of sales of products that include our technology 
our international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks and costs 
we currently have sales personnel in finland  japan  korea  switzerland  taiwan and china and we intend to expand our international activities 
international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  foreign exchange and currency risks  import and export restrictions  duties  tariffs  quotas and other barriers  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties and expense in enforcing ip rights  business risks  including fluctuations in demand for our technologies and products and the cost and effort to conduct international operations and travel abroad to promote international distribution and overall global economic conditions  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  political and economic instability  and an outbreak of hostilities in markets where major customers are located  including korea 
our international operations could also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls  or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
our international operations could also increase our exposure to complex international tax rules and regulations 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our income tax provision 
in addition  our operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments by our employees  vendors  or agents 

table of contents we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technologies  and develop new technologies 
accordingly  our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
furthermore  we believe that there are a limited number of engineering and technical personnel that are experienced in haptics 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate  and retain sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of  if  how  and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
additionally some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices above the current market price of our common stock or that are largely vested 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our current litigation is expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  and will continue to be  until resolved  and regardless of whether we are ultimately successful  could adversely affect our business 
we have been in the past and are currently a party to various legal proceedings 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict how these cases will ultimately be resolved 
we anticipate that currently pending litigation will continue to be costly and that future litigation or investigations will result in additional legal expenses  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful or be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with litigation or investigations 
we expense litigation and investigatory costs as incurred  and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
litigation and investigations have diverted  and could continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved or concluded  litigation and investigations could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
for additional background on this and our other litigation  please see note to the consolidated financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
our products or our licensees products may have flaws or other defects that may lead to personal or other injury claims 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  property damage  financial loss  or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
in addition  even though we have transitioned from the medical products business  we could face product liability claims for products that we have sold or that our successors have sold or may sell in the future 
defending any claims against us  regardless of merit  would be time consuming  expensive to defend  and distracting to management  and could result in damages and injure our reputation  the reputation of our technology  services  or products  or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels  or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we could face such claims in the future  which could harm our business and 
table of contents reputation 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
our technologies are complex and may contain undetected errors  which could harm our reputation and future sales 
any failure to provide high quality and reliable technologies  whether caused by our own failure or failures of our suppliers or oem customers  could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our technologies 
our technologies have in the past contained  and may in the future contain  undetected errors or defects 
some errors in our technologies may only be discovered after a customer s product incorporating our technologies has been shipped to customers 
any errors or defects discovered in our technologies after commercial release could result in product recalls  loss of revenue  loss of customers  and increased service and warranty costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
our customers may have difficulties obtaining the components necessary to manufacture haptic based products  which could harm our business and results of operations 
in order to manufacture haptic based products  our customers require components such as actuators and amplifiers 
the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of these components could disrupt our customers production processes which would harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  our newer products require new types of components that we expect will be developed and sold by our ecosystem partners 
failure of our ecosystem partners to bring these products to market in a timely fashion  with appropriate levels of quality  and at attractive prices may affect our ability to secure customers for these newer products which could harm our business and results of operations 
component suppliers to customers could also be affected by natural disasters and other similar events 
catastrophic events  such as natural disasters  war  and acts of terrorism could disrupt the business of our customers  which could harm our business and results of operations 
the production processes and operations of our customers are susceptible to the occurrence of catastrophic events  such as natural disasters  war  and acts of terrorism  all of which are outside of our control 
any such events could cause a serious business disruption to our customers ability to manufacture  distribute and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  which may adversely affect our business and results of operation 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage  or terrorist activity 
a substantial portion of our research and development activities  operations  our corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
an earthquake at or near our facilities could disrupt our operations and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired  which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results  our ability to operate our business and our stock price 
we have in the past had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
any 
table of contents failure on our part to remedy identified material weaknesses  or any additional delays or errors in our financial reporting  could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our company will have been detected 
the nature of some of our products may also subject us to export control regulation by the us department of state and the department of commerce 
violations of these regulations can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
our sales to customers or sales by our customers to their end customers in some areas outside the united states could be subject to government export regulations or restrictions that prohibit us or our licensees from selling to customers in some countries or that require us to obtain licenses or approvals to export such products internationally 
delays or denial of the grant of any required license or approval  or changes to the regulations  could make it difficult or impossible to make sales to foreign customers in some countries and could adversely affect our revenue 
in addition  we could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of these export regulations if we were found in violation 
such violation could result in penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
investment risks our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing and recognition of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  as well as other multi element arrangements  seasonality in the demand for our technologies or products or our licensees products  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  stock based awards  acquisitions of technologies  or businesses  development in any pending litigation  the timing of introductions and market acceptance of new technologies and products and product enhancements by us  our licensees  our competitors  or their competitors  the timing of work performed under development agreements  and corrections and true ups to royalty payments and royalty rates from prior periods 

table of contents changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse  unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and other compliance areas that will increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq stock market 
the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased and we expect will continue to increase our legal  accounting and financial compliance costs  will make some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly  and may also place undue strain on our personnel  systems and resources 
additionally  the sec has promulgated final rules in connection with the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals  known as conflict minerals  that are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries 
the metals covered by the rules include tin  tantalum  tungsten  and gold 
the rules require us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if we know or have reason to believe any of the minerals used in the production process may have originated from the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country 
if we are not able to determine the minerals did not originate from a covered country  we would be required to perform supply chain due diligence on members of our supply chain 
these new requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals  and may affect our  our customers or our manufactures ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  changes by game console manufacturers to not include touch enabling capabilities in their products  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of our common stock by insiders or others  stock repurchase activity  changes in securities analysts recommendations  personnel changes  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company 
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility 
there can be no assurance that any repurchases will actually be made under the program  nor is there any assurance that a sufficient number of shares of our common stock will be repurchased to satisfy the market s expectations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any repurchases conducted under the plan will be made at the best possible price 
the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity 
table of contents for our stock 
additionally  we are permitted to and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our board of directors or management  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms  only our chairperson of the board of directors  a majority of our board of directors or or greater stockholders are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders  our stockholders can only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent  vacancies on our board of directors can be filled only by our board of directors and not by our stockholders  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  and advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention  or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future  acquire businesses or ip that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities  or increase our ip portfolio 
the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying  investigating  and pursuing suitable acquisitions  whether or not they are consummated 
if we consummate acquisitions through the issuance of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired ip or other assets  charges associated with amortization of acquired assets or potential charges for write down of assets associated with unsuccessful acquisitions  potential ip infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines or technologies  and potential costs associated with failed acquisition efforts 

table of contents any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
as our business grows  such growth may place a significant strain on our management and operations and  as a result  our business may suffer 
we plan to continue expanding our business  and any significant growth could place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
we will need to continue to invest the necessary capital to upgrade and improve our operational  financial and management reporting systems 
if our management fails to manage our growth effectively  we could experience increased costs  declines in product quality  and or customer satisfaction  which could harm our business

item legal proceedings in re immersion corporation securities litigation in september and october  various putative shareholder class action and derivative complaints were filed in federal and state court against us and certain current and former immersion directors and officers 
on september   a securities class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
over the following five weeks  four additional class action complaints were filed 
one of these four actions was later voluntarily dismissed 
the securities class action complaints name us and certain current and former immersion directors and officers as defendants and allege violations of federal securities laws based on our issuance of allegedly misleading financial statements 
the various complaints assert claims covering the period from may through july and seek compensatory damages allegedly sustained by the purported class members 
on december   these class actions were consolidated by the court as in re immersion corporation securities litigation 
on the same day  the court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff s counsel

in re immersion corporation derivative litigation on september   a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california  purportedly on behalf of us and naming certain of our current and former directors and officers as individual defendants 
thereafter  two additional putative derivative complaints were filed in the same court 
the derivative complaints arise from the same or similar alleged facts as the federal securities actions and seek to bring state law causes of action on behalf of us against the individual defendants for breaches of fiduciary duty  gross negligence  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  breach of contract  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment  as well as for violations of federal securities laws 
the federal derivative complaints seek compensatory damages  corporate governance changes  unspecified equitable and injunctive relief  the imposition of a constructive trust  and restitution 
on november   the court consolidated these actions as in re immersion corporation derivative litigation and appointed lead counsel 
on may   the court issued an order staying the action  and that stay was lifted following dismissal of the securities class action in december on october   plaintiffs filed a statement with the court indicating that in light of the settlement of the kasmer v 
richardson action referenced below  they intend to voluntarily dismiss their action with prejudice once the time to appeal the kasmer settlement approval order has expired 
the parties jointly moved to dismiss the action on january   and the court dismissed the action with prejudice on january  kasmer v 
immersion corporation on may   an action was filed in delaware chancery court by a shareholder seeking to enforce a demand to inspect certain of our records pursuant to section of the delaware general corporation law  as a possible prelude to the shareholder bringing a derivative action 
we filed our answer on june   questioning whether a proper purpose for the records inspection had been stated and raising other defenses concerning the scope of the demand  among other deficiencies 
following a one day trial on december   the court significantly narrowed the scope of the demand and we responded accordingly 
on october   the shareholder filed a motion seeking to compel further responses to the demand 
we believe that our responses complied with the court s ruling and we opposed the shareholder s motion

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  as amended 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  may  will  and other similar expressions 
however  these words are not the only way we identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements  which refer to expectations  projections  or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in item a  risk factors  those described elsewhere in this report  and those described in our other reports filed with the sec 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that could occur after the filing of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  short term investments  patents and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including accounting standards codification asc s  revenue recognition asc s  asc  multiple element arrangements asc  and asc  software revenue recognition asc 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
as described below  management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period based on the judgments and estimates made by our management 
specifically  in connection with each transaction  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists for a license arrangement  we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us 
for a stand alone product sale  we require a purchase order or other form of written agreement with the customer 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software and product to our customers physically and also deliver software electronically 
for physical deliveries not related to software  our transfer terms typically include transfer of title and risk of loss at our shipping location 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 

table of contents the fee is fixed or determinable 
our arrangement fee is based on the use of standard payment terms which are those that are generally extended to the majority of customers 
for transactions involving extended payment terms  we deem these fees not to be fixed or determinable for revenue recognition purposes and revenue is deferred until the fees become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial condition and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when payment is received 
royalty and license revenue we license our portfolio of patents to customers in a variety of industries such as mobility  gaming  automotive  and medical devices 
a majority of these are variable fee arrangements where the royalties earned by us are based on unit or sales volumes of the respective licensees 
we also enter into fixed license fee arrangements 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give notification of royalties due to us within days of the end of the quarter during which their related sales occur 
as we are unable to estimate the licensees sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize fixed license fee revenue for licenses to our ip when earned under the terms of the agreements  which is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the license 
certain royalties are based upon customer shipments or revenues and could be subject to change and may result in out of period adjustments 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue are comprised of engineering services engineering services and or development contracts and in very limited cases  post contract customer support pcs 
engineering services revenues are recognized under the proportional performance accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed or completed performance method 
a provision for losses on contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenue from pcs is typically recognized over the period of the ongoing obligation  which is generally consistent with the contractual term 
multiple element arrangements we enter into multiple element arrangements in which customers purchase time based non exclusive licenses that cannot be resold to others  which include a combination of software and or ip licenses  engineering services  and in very limited cases pcs 
for arrangements that are software based and include software and engineering services  the services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software  and customers may purchase engineering services to facilitate the adoption of our technology  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other engineering service organizations to perform these services 
for these arrangements  including those with pcs  revenue is recognized either over the period of the ongoing obligation which is generally consistent with the contractual term  or when deliverables have been completed 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of products and the license of associated software  if any  and expense all related costs of products sold  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance  if required  has been achieved 
we have determined that the license of software for the medical simulation products is incidental to the product as a whole 
we typically grant our customers a warranty which guarantees that our products will substantially conform to our current specifications for generally three to twelve months from the delivery date pursuant to the terms of the arrangement 
historically  warranty related costs have not been significant 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes both cost of product sales and cost of development contract revenues 
cost of product sales consists primarily of contract manufacturing and other overhead costs 
cost of development contract revenue includes primarily labor related costs relating to these contracts 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 

table of contents valuation and amortization method we use the black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model  single option approach to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
stock based compensation expense recognized at fair value includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors that impact the expected term  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and espp shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire and be worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock based compensation 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and are reversed at such time that realization is believed to be more likely than not 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions  and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render inaccurate our current assumptions  judgments  and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets 
any of the 
table of contents assumptions  judgments  and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
short term investments our short term investments consist primarily of us treasury bills and government agency securities purchased with an original or remaining maturity of greater than days on the date of purchase 
we classify all debt securities with readily determinable market values as available for sale 
even though the stated maturity dates of these debt securities may be one year or more beyond the balance sheet date  we have classified all debt securities as short term investments as they are available for current operations and reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold within one year 
these investments are carried at fair market value  and using the specific identification method  any unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in nature are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
for debt securities in an unrealized loss position  we are required to assess whether i we have the intent to sell the debt security or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  an other than temporary impairment on the security must be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between its fair value and amortized cost basis 
for debt securities in an unrealized loss position which are deemed to be other than temporary where neither of the criteria in the paragraph above are present  the difference between the security s then current amortized cost basis and fair value is separated into i the amount of the impairment related to the credit loss ie  the credit loss component and ii the amount of the impairment related to all other factors ie  the non credit loss component 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 
the non credit loss component is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the credit loss component is the excess of the amortized cost of the security over the best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security 
the non credit component is the residual amount of the other than temporary impairment 
when calculating the present value of expected cash flows to determine the credit loss component of the other than temporary impairment  we estimate the amount and timing of projected cash flows on a security by security basis 
these calculations reflect our expectations of the performance of the underlying collateral and of the issuer to meet payment obligations as applicable 
the expected cash flows are discounted using the effective interest rate of the security prior to any impairment 
the amortized cost basis of a debt security is adjusted for credit losses recorded to earnings 
the difference between the cash flows expected to be collected and the new cost basis is accreted to investment income over the remaining expected life of the security 
further information about short term investments may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
patents and intangible assets we have acquired patents and other intangible assets 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal  filing  and continuation or annuity fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets  and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they are issued  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during the year ended december   we capitalized costs associated with patents and trademarks of million 
our total amortization expense exclusive of impairments or abandonments of  for the same period was million 

table of contents the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations overview of we continued to invest in research  development  sales  and marketing in our key lines of business 
key events in the year were as follows we increased our royalty and license revenue by and our overall revenue increased by for the year ended december  compared to the increase in royalty and license revenue was mainly due to additional revenue from our medical  mobility  automotive  and chip and other licensees 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in product sales  primarily due to reduced sales of our virtual iv simulation product 
our loss from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  the loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses which include an increase in general and administrative expenses  mainly resulting from increased litigation expenses of approximately million partially offset by increased gross profit from increased revenue and by reduced compensation related operating expenses 
in  we expect royalty revenue to be the major component of our revenue as our technology continues to be included in more of our licensees products and as we continue to implement our patent licensing program relating to basic haptics 
ip litigation may cause us to expend significant financial resources in the future and have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
additionally  our success could be limited by several factors  including global economic conditions  the timely release of our new products and our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors

the increase in royalty and license revenue was due to increases from our medical  mobility  automotive  and chip and other licensees  partially offset by decreases from our gaming licensees 
royalty and license revenue increased by for mobility customers primarily due to an increased volume of new handsets and other devices sold primarily by korean and japanese licensees 
we anticipate that this line of business will grow in importance as mobile device manufacturers increasingly recognize the value of our ip and technology and as we expand our presence in china  korea  and japan 

table of contents royalty and license revenue increased by for medical customers primarily due to additional royalty revenue from additional volume of units sold by our licensees along with additional license fees 
royalty and license revenue also increased by for automotive customers due to our technology being incorporated in an increased volume of vehicles 
royalty and license revenue increased by for chip and other customers primarily due to increased volume of chips sold into china and other asian markets 
royalty and license revenue decreased by for gaming customers mainly due to a decrease in units shipped by certain licensees 
this decrease was primarily due to the current softness in the console gaming market  which can fluctuate based upon consumer gaming preferences and the timing of introductions of new gaming console systems 
we expect royalty and license revenue to be the major component of our future revenue as our technology continues to be included in more products and as we continue our efforts to monetize our ip 
we typically experience seasonally higher revenue from our gaming and mobility customers due to the reporting of holiday sales in the first calendar quarter 
product sales product sales are comprised primarily of medical products  actuators  design kits  and integrated circuits 
the decrease in product sales primarily reflects a reduction in medical product sales specifically related to weaker demand for our virtual iv simulator product 
in december of we entered into a royalty generating licensing agreement with our virtual iv partner in accordance with which we will no longer produce the virtual iv system 
as a result of this agreement  we expect product sales will be significantly lower in the future 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue is comprised of revenue on commercial contracts 
development contracts and other revenue increased mainly due to an increase in contracted engineering service revenue from our mobility and automotive customers partially offset by a decrease in engineering service revenue from our medical customers 
we continue to focus our engineering resources on development efforts that leverage our existing sales and channel distribution capabilities 
accordingly  we do not expect development contract revenue to be a significant part of total revenues in the future

compared to royalty and license revenue the increase in royalty and license revenue was due to increases in royalty and license revenue generated primarily from increases in the mobility  gaming  and medical lines of business  partially offset by decreases from our other licensees 
royalty and license revenue increased by for gaming customers mainly due to increases in royalties from new and existing customers due to increased units shipped by licensees  partially offset by decreases in certain true ups and other one time payments that occurred primarily in the second quarter of royalty and license revenue increased by for mobility customers primarily due to increases in units shipped and more widespread adoption of our technology in the mobility market 
we also recorded approximately  as an increase in revenue as a result of customers self reporting adjustments to previously reported amounts 

table of contents product sales the decrease in product sales was due primarily to a million decrease in medical product sales mainly due to the divesture of medical simulation product lines 
on march  we entered into an agreement with cae and sold certain assets and divested the endoscopy  endovascular  and laparoscopy medical simulation product lines to cae resulting in reduced medical product sales subsequent to that date 
revenue for the year ended december  for the divested medical product lines was approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

we evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments we have cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments as of december  we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
the primary objective of our policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
our policy s guidelines limit exposure to loss by limiting the sums we can invest in any individual security and restricting investment to securities that meet certain defined credit ratings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rates a substantial majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do incur certain operating costs for our foreign operations in other currencies but these operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally we have some reliance on international and export sales that are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign currency hedging arrangements
