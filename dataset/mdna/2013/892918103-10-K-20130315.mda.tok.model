item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain customers gtech is our most significant customer 
in december  we signed a new five year agreement effective november   with gtech the gtech thermal printer agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we provide gtech with their latest generation thermal lottery printers for various lottery applications 
the terms of the agreement require that gtech exclusively purchase all of its requirements for thermal on line lottery printers from us and that we exclusively sell such printers to gtech through january we previously had an additional oem purchase agreement with gtech that provided for the sale of older generation thermal on line lottery printers and spare parts  at fixed prices  through its expiration date of june  this agreement was not renewed as the underlying thermal printers and related spare parts were discontinued at the end of sales to gtech and other customers representing or more of our total net sales were as follows year ended december  gtech customer a backlog our backlog of firm orders was approximately  as of february   compared to  as of february  based on customers current delivery requirements  we expect to ship our entire current backlog during competition the market for transaction based and specialty printing solutions is extremely competitive  and we expect such competition to continue in the future 
we compete with a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
we believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control  including durability  reliability  quality  design capability  product customization  price  customer support  success in developing new products  manufacturing expertise and capacity  supply of component parts and materials  strategic relationships with suppliers  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  general market  economic and political conditions and  in some cases  the uniqueness of our products 
in the banking and pos market  our major competitor is epson america  inc  which holds a dominant market position of the pos markets into which we sell 
we also compete  to a much lesser extent  with transaction printer group tpg  star micronics america  inc  citizen cbm america corporation  pertech resources  inc  addmaster  and samsung bixolon 
certain competitors of ours have greater financial resources  lower costs attributable to higher volume production and sometimes offer lower prices than us 
in the food safety market  we compete with avery dennison corporation  ecolab inc and integrated control corp 
we compete in this market based largely on our ability to provide highly specialized products  custom engineering and ongoing technical support 
in the lottery market consisting principally of on line lottery transaction printing  we hold a leading position  based largely on our long term purchase agreements with gtech 
we compete in this market based solely on our ability to provide specialized  custom engineered products to gtech 
in the casino and gaming market consisting principally of slot machine and video lottery terminal transaction printing and promotional coupon printing  we compete with several companies including futurelogic  inc  nanoptix  inc  custom engineering spa and others 
certain of our products sold for casino and gaming applications compete based upon our ability to provide highly specialized products  custom engineering and ongoing technical support 
in the printrex market  we compete with the imaging systems group  inc isys  neuralog inc  gsi group and others 
we compete in this market based largely on our ability to provide specialized  custom engineered products 
the tsg business is highly fragmented  and we compete with numerous competitors of various sizes  including pos and internet resellers  depending on the geographic area 
our strategy for competing in our markets is to continue to develop new products hardware and software and product line extensions  to increase our geographic market penetration  to take advantage of strategic relationships  and to lower product costs by sourcing certain products overseas 
although we believe that our products  operations and relationships provide a competitive foundation  there can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the future 
in addition  our products utilize certain inkjet  thermal and impact printing technology 
if other technologies  or variations to existing technologies  were to evolve or become available to us  it is possible that we would incorporate these technologies into our products 
alternatively  if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors  our products could become obsolete  which would have a significant negative impact on our business 
research and development activities research  development  and engineering expenditures represent costs incurred in the experimental or laboratory sense aimed at discovery and or application of new knowledge in developing a new product or process  or in bringing about significant improvement in an existing product or process 
we spent approximately   and  in  and  respectively  on engineering  design and product development efforts in connection with specialized engineering and design to introduce new hardware and software products and to customize or improve existing products 
costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established  at which point all material software costs are capitalized within intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheet until the product is available for general release to customers 
while judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established  we have determined that it is reached after all high risk development issues have been documented in a formal detailed plan design 
the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of sales over the estimated life of the product 
during we began the development of epicentraltm  that enables casino customers to print coupons and promotions at the slot machine 
unamortized development costs for such software were approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the total amount charged to cost of sales for capitalized software development costs were approximately  and  in and  respectively 
environment we are not aware of any material noncompliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
employees as of december   transact and our subsidiaries employed persons  of whom were full time and were temporary employees 
none of our employees are unionized  and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  as well as other disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  because they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not known to us now or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
we assume no obligation and specifically disclaim any such obligation to update these risk factors or any other forward looking statements contained in this annual report to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward looking statements  except as required by law 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate 
our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those identified throughout this risk factors section market acceptance of our products  both domestically and internationally  development of new competitive products by others  our responses to price competition  our level of research and development activities  changes in the amount that we spend to develop  acquire or license new products  consumables  technologies or businesses  changes in the amount we spend to promote our products and services  changes in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of printers  delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and consumables and the generation of sales from those products  the geographic distribution of our sales  availability of third party components at reasonable prices  general economic and industry conditions  including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments  that affect customer demand  severe weather events such as hurricanes that can disrupt or interrupt the operation of our customers or suppliers facilities  and changes in accounting rules 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance 
our revenue and profitability depend on our ability to continue to develop  on a timely basis  new products and technologies which are free from hardware or software anomalies and cannot be fraudulently manipulated the success of newly introduced printers such as the ithaca food safety terminal and the printrex and printrex oil and gas color printers is dependent on how quickly customers in the related markets accept them given the very little market penetration the printers currently have experienced since they are so new and innovative and have limited competition 
additionally  the success of new technology  such as printing coupons and promotions at the slot machine using our epicentral print system  is dependent on our casino customers acceptance of such technology 
while we have designed our epicentral print system to support our customers existing investment in our epic thermal casino printers  such acceptance may nevertheless only build gradually over time or not at all 
delays in acceptance by our customers of new technologies may adversely affect our operations 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt our capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products 
because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past  we must continually refine our capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation 
if we cannot efficiently adapt our infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders 
we received multiple public notices during from a significant shareholder that encouraged our board of directors to undertake an extensive review of all strategic opportunities that  in the opinion of such shareholder  would best position us for future growth in addition to maximizing shareholder value 
during  the board of directors publicly responded to this shareholder addressing his concerns and ensuring that any decisions made would be for the benefit of all shareholders of the company 
if shareholder activism continues or increases  particularly with respect to matters which our board of directors  in exercising their fiduciary duties  disagree with or have determined not to pursue  our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management  and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners 
we rely on resellers to sell our products and services 
we use a variety of distribution channels  including oems and distributors  to market our products 
we may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels 
our dependence upon resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market  concentration of credit risk  including disruption in distribution should the resellers financial condition deteriorate  reduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult  resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor 
we cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
general economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
global consumer confidence has eroded amidst concerns over  among other things  declining asset values  inflation  volatility in energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  rising unemployment  and the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses and sovereign nations 
these concerns have slowed global economic growth and have resulted in recessions in numerous countries  including many of those in north america  europe and asia  where the company does substantially all of its business 
as these economic conditions continue to persist  or if they worsen  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders  the insolvency of key suppliers which could result in production delays  the inability of customers to obtain credit  and the insolvency of one or more customers 
any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables  create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales  and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write downs of assets 
in the lottery market  we have been dependent on sales to one large customer  the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales 
we expect that sales to one large customer will continue to represent a material percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
a reduction  delay or cancellation in orders from this customer  including reductions or delays due to market  economic  or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue a growth strategy 
assuming this growth occurs  it will require the expansion of distribution relationships in international markets  the successful development and marketing of new products for our existing and new markets  expanded customer service and support  and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational  financial and management information systems 
to the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions  our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently 
we may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees  customers or suppliers 
it may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined 
as we pursue acquisitions  we may incur legal  accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy  or that we can successfully manage expanded operations 
as we expand  we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we compete in highly competitive markets  which are likely to become more competitive 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 
we face significant competition in developing and selling our printers  transaction supplies and services 
principal competitors have substantial marketing  financial  development and personnel resources 
to remain competitive  we believe we must continue to provide technologically advanced printers that satisfy the user demands  superior customer service  high levels of quality and reliability  and dependable and efficient distribution networks 
we cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share  and could require increased spending on research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 
any of these factors could reduce our earnings 
we have outsourced a large portion of the assembly of our printers to two contract manufacturers and will be dependent on them for the manufacturing of such printers 
a failure by these contract manufacturers  or any disruption in such manufacturing  may adversely affect our business results 
in an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits  we have continued to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our printers to contract manufacturers in asia 
however  to the extent we rely on a third party service provider for manufacturing services  we may incur increased business continuity risks 
we will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of certain of our printers or any related operations or processes  including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by contract manufacturers 
if we are unable to effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if either contract manufacturer experiences business difficulties or fails to meet our manufacturing needs  then we may be unable to meet production requirements  may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain relationships with our customers 
without the contract manufacturers continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturers facilities  we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our printers until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility  which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate  this insurance does not cover all possible situations 
in addition  the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact  both short term and long term  on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
the contract manufacturers have access to our intellectual property  which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 
we source some of our component parts and consumable products from sole source suppliers  any disruptions may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
a disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we sell a significant portion of our products internationally and purchase important components from foreign suppliers 
these circumstances create a number of risks 
we sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the united states 
shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 
risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales  or increase costs of purchasing  in foreign countries  foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions  political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk  restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets  and potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries  such as china  may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 
we face risks associated with manufacturing forecasts 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales 
we currently use a rolling month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms  and demand for each component at a given time 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales 
if we overestimate our requirements  we could have excess inventory of parts 
in addition  delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could materially impact our business 
our future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel 
the loss of either bart c 
shuldman  the company chairman of the board and chief executive officer  or steven a 
demartino  the company s president  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  or the loss of certain groups of key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
prosecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property  which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
these factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief  and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation  and our competitive position may be materially damaged 
our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages 
copyrights  patents  trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets 
infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage  and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
third parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights 
to the extent of a violation of a third party s patent or other intellectual property right  we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages  to obtain a license  if available  or to use a non infringing method  if possible  to accomplish our objectives 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
if such claims are successful  they could result in costly judgments or settlements 
refer to item legal proceedings for discussion surrounding litigation we are currently involved in regarding alleged misappropriation of unspecified trade secrets and confidential information 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors  such as changes in our business  operations or prospects  developments in our relationships with our customers  announcements of new products or services by us or by our competitors  announcement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors  changes in existing or adoption of additional government regulations  unfavorable or reduced analyst coverage  and prevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
broad market fluctuations  general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
limited trading volume and a reduction in analyst coverage of our capital stock may contribute to its price volatility 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
during the year ended december   the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the nasdaq global market was approximately  shares 
we are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop 
in addition  many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro cap and small cap companies 
during  an analyst who previously followed our common stock discontinued coverage of it which may further reduce our trading volume 
as a result  relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings  and we may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions 
shares of our common stock are also available for future sale pursuant to stock options that we have granted to our employees  and in the future we may grant additional stock options and other forms of equity compensation to our employees 
sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis  and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
if market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  or there is a change to applicable tax rules  future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot provide any assurance that current laws  or any laws enacted in the future  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to laws  rules  regulations  including environmental regulations  government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
changes in laws  rules  regulations  policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products  which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
if we do not comply with applicable laws  rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted 
our business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures  military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism 
our business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures  military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism 
it is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry 
heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism 
any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence 
any downturn in the economy or in the gaming industry in particular could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import export of goods  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy sell goods 
intangible computer software costs may not be recoverable 
costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established  at which point all material software costs are capitalized within intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheet until the product is available for general release to customers 
while judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established  we have determined that it is reached after all high risk development issues have been documented in a formal detailed plan design 
the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of sales over the estimated life of the product 
to the extent technological feasibility of products is not achieved  related capitalized computer software costs may not be recoverable 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  and results of operations

overview during  we transitioned our business to focus on sales of value added products and technologies in diversified growth markets while moving away from the low margin  commoditized pos market 
to that end  we successfully launched three new products that we believe present the opportunity to significantly change transact in terms of growing our printing solution and related consumables revenue as well as expanding our gross margin and operating income margin 
we developed two of these new printers a for the oil and gas exploration market which we believe represents a worldwide growth opportunity for us based on studies which show that the us will likely become energy independent in the next twenty years 
our printrex printer  the fastest color office printer designed specifically for high volume printing of oil and gas logging reports  has already won orders and each of these printers has the opportunity to drive significant recurring consumable revenue based on proprietary inkjet cartridges  inkjet print heads and other items that these printers consume as our customers use the printer 
our new printrex  a thermal truck mounted printer designed for the rugged and demanding exploration and production market  prints color logging reports at the well site utilizing proprietary color thermal paper which also represents another lucrative recurring consumable revenue stream for us 
we have already received positive initial responses from the industry to our new color thermal printing technology which would replace the black and white printing of logging reports done today for drilling  casing and wire line analysis 
the printrex printer has to be integrated into the many oil and gas explorations systems around the world and we are working closely with customers in this market to finalize this integration

additionally  we began shipping our new food safety and nutritional labeling terminal  the ithaca food safety terminal  in the fourth quarter of initial orders included customers such as mcdonalds as well as field tests and trials at several other widely known restaurant chains 
while we anticipate that it will take several months to get the field trials and testing completed at the different venues  we expect the ithaca food safety terminal to be a significant contributor to our sales in we also benefited from a full year of sales of printrex printers and the related tsg products in which provided gross margins above transact s historical average

during  our banking printer sales increased primarily due to sales from a large order for our ithaca thermal receipt printer to a new banking customer that did not occur in in the pos market  we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant  hospitality and specialty retail markets 
sales of our pos printers decreased in primarily driven by a decrease in both domestic and international sales of our two pos printer products to mcdonald s  the ithaca and ithaca  for its combined beverage initiative and its pos system upgrade which includes grill initiative printer upgrades  as the rollout of printers for these initiatives is substantially complete

such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment 
please refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell replacement parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition asc 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from the sale of printers to our distributors and resellers on a sell in basis and on substantially the same terms as we recognize revenue from all our other customers 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
we have developed a new software solution  epicentraltm  that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real time at the slot machine 
revenue arrangements for epicentraltm include multiple deliverables and as a result such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with both asc  multiple element arrangements and asc  software 
epicentraltm is primarily comprised of both a software component  which is licensed  and a hardware component  which can either be leased or sold to end users  and both components are integrated to deliver the system s full functionality 
under leasing arrangements  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the lease term  excluding revenue allocated to installation  which is recognized upon completion 
in an arrangement where the hardware is purchased  revenue  inclusive of software license fees  is generally recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer 
for epicentraltm and other multiple deliverable arrangements  we consider whether the deliverables in an arrangement are within the scope of existing higher level gaap and apply such literature to the extent that it provides guidance regarding whether to separate multiple deliverable arrangements and how to allocate value among those separate units of accounting 
we also determine whether revenue arrangements consist of more than one unit of accounting at inception of the arrangement and recognize revenue as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
we allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the relative fair value for all units of accounting in the arrangement  except where amounts allocable to the delivered units is limited to that which is contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to asc  separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to this provision  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for advance payments received from customers for maintenance contracts 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have not been material 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
we charge our customers for shipping and handling services 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was approximately  or less than of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changing market conditions 
based on these reviews  inventory write downs are recorded  as necessary  to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
goodwill and intangible assets we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets 
the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc goodwill  acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change  that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate 
we reported  of goodwill and  of unamortized definite lived intangible assets at december  we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred based on our assessment as of december  when the impairment review is performed 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance or tax reserve  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
it also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
the accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a company s income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
warranty we generally warrant our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to asc  contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
if the actual liabilities are settled in an amount greater than those recorded on the balance sheet  a charge to income would be recorded 
as of december  and  a contingent liability of  and  respectively  was recorded in connection with a contingent consideration arrangement entered into as part of the printrex acquisition 
the increase of  was the result of our revised estimate of the expected payout in connection with this arrangement primarily due to changes in probabilities and increases in revenue and gross margin estimates  and was charged to general and administrative expense during see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly

however  beginning in the second half of  we began to ship ithaca printers to mcdonald s for a new application that we expect to continue into this decrease in sales was largely offset by higher sales of our banking printers mainly due to sales from a large order for our ithaca thermal receipt printer to a new banking customer which we completed shipments to in the third quarter of although we are currently pursuing several banking opportunities  due to the project oriented nature of these sales  we cannot predict the level of future sales

net income 
we reported net income during of  or  per diluted share  compared to  or  per diluted share  for liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  treasury share repurchases  dividend payments  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents  available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines  if needed  are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  treasury share repurchases  dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional debt and or equity financing  although no assurances can be given  we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance 
cash flow during  our cash balance increased  or  from december  as we used a substantial portion of our cash flow to return shareholders in the form of  of repurchases of our common stock and  of cash dividends paid to our common shareholders 
even after funding these items and our capital expenditures  we ended with  in cash and cash equivalents and no debt outstanding 

operating activities the following significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of  in as compared to  in during we reported net income of  we recorded depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense of  including  of amortization related to intangible assets acquired from printrex 
accounts receivable increased  due primarily to significantly higher sales volume during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories decreased  due primarily to a focused effort at inventory management through a reduction in inventory purchases and sales fulfillment through existing inventory stock throughout we expect our inventories to increase during as we increase stocking levels of our newly launched food safety and printrex products 
accounts payable increased  due to primarily to higher inventory purchases made during the fourth quarter to support significantly higher sales volume compared to the fourth quarter of accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased  due primarily to an increase in income taxes payable of approximately  resulting from a higher level of income before income taxes in the fourth quarter compared to additionally  we increased our estimate of accrued contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of printrex by  during based on our revised estimate of the expected payout 
during we reported net income of  we recorded depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense of  including  of amortization related to intangible assets acquired from printrex 
we recorded non cash deferred income tax expense of  incremental tax benefits from stock options exercised were  accounts receivable decreased  due to lower sales volume and the timing of sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories increased  due to lower than anticipated sales volume in the last six months of accounts payable decreased  due to significantly lower inventory purchases and the timing of payments during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased  due primarily to a reduction of income taxes payable resulting from the overpayment of our tax liability as certain tax credits were higher than anticipated 
correspondingly  we recorded refundable income taxes of  investing activities our capital expenditures were  and  in and  respectively 
expenditures in included  for the purchase of new product tooling with the remaining amount primarily for the purchase of computer hardware and software and manufacturing equipment 
expenditures in included  for the purchase of new product tooling   for the purchase of computer  networking equipment  and software   for the purchase of engineering equipment  and the remaining amount primarily for the purchase of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
additionally  our capitalized software development costs for the epicentral print system were  and  in and  respectively 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately  primarily for new product tooling and tooling enhancements for our existing products 
on august   we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of printrex for  in cash and potential future contingent consideration as previously discussed 
financing activities we used  of cash from financing activities during to purchase  of common stock for treasury and  to make our first ever cash dividend payment  partially offset by  of proceeds and incremental tax benefits from stock option exercises 
during  we used  of cash from financing activities to purchase  of common stock for treasury and  in financing costs associated with our amended td bank credit facility as discussed below  partially offset by  of proceeds and incremental tax benefits from stock option exercises 
working capital our working capital decreased approximately to  at december  from  at december  our current ratio also decreased to at december   compared to at december  the decrease in our working capital and current ratio was primarily due to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances primarily resulting from increased inventory purchases and the timing of payments in the fourth quarter of as compared to in addition to lower inventory balances 
these were partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances and cash and cash equivalents  despite the significant treasury share repurchases and cash dividend payments previously discussed  in the fourth quarter of compared to resource sufficiency we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs  finance our capital expenditures  treasury stock repurchases  dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
credit facility and borrowings on november   we signed a three year amendment to renew our existing  credit facility the td bank credit facility with td bank na td bank 
the td bank credit facility provides for a  revolving credit line expiring on november  borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets 
we also pay a fee of on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line 
the total deferred financing costs relating to expenses incurred to complete the td bank credit facility was  on september   we signed an amendment to td bank credit facility that allows us to declare and pay cash dividends to holders of our outstanding common shares subject to approval by our board of directors and provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the credit facility on the date of the dividend payment 
the amendment also allows us to use up to  in revolving credit loans to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks as well as requires cash dividend payments to be treated as distributions for purposes of quarterly debt covenant calculations 
the td bank credit facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the td bank credit facility at december  the following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at december  financial covenant requirement restriction calculation at december  operating cash flow total debt service minimum of times times funded debt ebitda maximum of times times as of december   undrawn commitments under the td bank credit facility were  shareholder dividend payments on september   we announced that our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the board s approval each quarter 
during  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share in the amount of approximately  which was paid on december  to common shareholders of record at the close of business on november  on february   our board of directors approved the first quarter dividend on our common stock in the amount of per share payable on or about march  to common shareholders of record at the close of business on february  we expect to pay approximately  in cash dividends to our common shareholders during stock repurchase program we maintain a stock repurchase program the stock repurchase program whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to  as increased from  in march through board of director approval  of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market over a three year period ending may   depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
we use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases  under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account 
repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date 
for the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately  at an average price of per share  under the stock repurchase program 
from january  through december   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for approximately  under all of our stock repurchase programs  at an average price of per share

contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations accrued contingent consideration total purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily of fully assembled printers and component part inventory 
accrued contingent consideration consists of potential future obligations for performance based cash payments in connection with the printrex acquisition 
impact of inflation we believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years 
however  inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in asia  as well as the cost of certain raw materials  component parts and labor used in the production of our products 
it also may increase our operating expenses  manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets 
despite continued growing costs of oil  gas and freight  we have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent  price increases  and we expect to be able to do the same during as such  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an increase or decrease of in effective interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we estimate that the combined translational and transactional impact of a overall movement in exchange rates from december  principally the uk pound sterling would not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
