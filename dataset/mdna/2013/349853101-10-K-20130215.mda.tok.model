item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american expedited ground freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including tlx  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
fasi provides pool distribution services throughout the mid atlantic  southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
pool distribution involves managing high frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions 
our primary customers for this product are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers  such as mall  strip mall and outlet based retail chains 
we service these customers through a network of terminals and service centers located in cities 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound or carton for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses  such as tlx  which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
trends and developments results from operations during the year ended december   we experienced a and increase in our consolidated revenues and income from operations  respectively  compared to the year ended december  forward air revenue and income from operations increased and  respectively 
forward air revenue increases were driven by the airport to airport and logistics service lines 
airport to airport increased primarily on higher utilization of forward air complete complete and increases in our price per pound 
our airport to airport price per pound increased on general rate increases initiated in september and june volumes or tonnage shipped through our airport to airport business increased in compared to  but volume gains were mainly in the first half of as volumes were down slightly year over year in the second half of the logistics revenue increase was attributable to higher tlx revenue on an increase in miles driven partially offset by a decline in our tlx revenue per mile 
fasi revenue increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in conjunction with the revenue growth  fasi income from operations improved million and over  from million in to million during the increase in revenue and the corresponding increase in operating income was the result of new business wins in the fourth quarters of and our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates  which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon  and the tonnage transiting our network 
for the majority of higher diesel prices and improved volumes did combine to increase our net fuel surcharge revenue by during the year end december  compared to the year ended december  goodwill in accordance with our accounting policy  we conducted our annual impairment assessments and tests of goodwill for each reporting unit as of june  and no impairment charges were required 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill related to the forward air and fasi segments was million and million  respectively 
based on our qualitative assessment of forward air we believed it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed the reporting unit carrying value 
during the second quarter of  we prepared an estimation of the fasi reporting unit fair value 
the estimation of fair value related to the impairment test for goodwill is particularly sensitive to projected financial 
table of contents information used in the calculations 
our fasi segment is currently facing the challenges of building  expanding and diversifying its revenue base 
if fasi efforts are significantly delayed  future estimates of projected financial information may be reduced  and we may be required to record an impairment charge against the carrying value of fasi goodwill

the increase in miles increased purchased transportation by million while the increase in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased in conjunction with the tonnage increase discussed above and a shift in our customer mix 
the increase in airport to airport cost per mile was mostly the result of increased utilization of more costly third party transportation providers as opposed to our network of owner operators and increased rates paid to third party transportation providers and our network of owner operators 
the increase in the rates paid to third party transportation providers and our network of owner operators was largely attributable to a shift in business and customer mix and the impact of these changes on the routes driven

table of contents serviced by company employed drivers so revenues were reduced without a corresponding decrease in other purchased transportation 
also  contributing to the increase as a percentage of revenue was the adverse impact on other terminal revenue of the slowing airport to airport tonnage growth during the second half of compared to the same period in further  certain new airport to airport linehaul business required the use of local pick up and delivery services 
this new business required us to incur other purchased transportation costs without direct corresponding other revenue

the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits in total dollars is due to increased wages and benefits for terminal employees  which increased in conjunction with the revenue volume increases discussed previously 
approximately of the the improvement in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is the result of certain new business being primarily linehaul based and requiring no significant salaries  wages and benefits 
also  during we continued our efforts to shift  wherever feasible  from company employed drivers to owner operators or third party transportation providers 
as a result we reduced pay to company employed drivers by as a percentage of revenue

these increases were partially offset by a million decline in legal and professional fees associated with vehicle and cargo claims 
the million increase in reserves for claims and loss development is attributable to increased known reserves for certain accidents and additional loss development required by the current year actuary analysis 
the increase in accident related vehicle damage is primarily the result of damage repairs required on rented trailers and tractors 
fasi fasi insurance and claims decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reduced cargo claims 
we attribute the decline in cargo claims to improvements in our security and processes to investigate and resolve missing or damaged freight

the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in average fuel prices during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net of reductions in miles driven by company owned or leased units 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in other 
table of contents operating expenses is attributable to increased variable costs  such as vehicle maintenance and dock supplies  during the year ended december   and the other operating expenses for the year ended december  being reduced by a million gain on the termination of a capital lease 
forward air variable costs increased during the year ended december   in conjunction with the shipping volume increases discussed previously  and decreased as a percentage of revenue as these increases were outpaced by the increase in forward air revenue 
fasi fasi other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reductions in dock supplies and savings from combining facilities with forward air 
the fasi customer losses discussed above were largely responsible for a million decrease in dock supplies due to the discontinued customers packing requirements 
fasi utility  property taxes and other facility related costs were reduced by approximately million primarily due to a full year of cost reductions associated with combining certain locations with forward air facilities 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the years ended december  and income from operations income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily the result of the increased revenue discussed previously and the resulting positive leverage the additional revenue provides against the fixed costs of the forward air network 
also  as discussed previously  contributing to the improvement in results was the favorable workers compensation reserve adjustment partially offset by increased reserves for vehicle accidents 
fasi fasi results from operations improved by million to million of income from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with the loss from operations being of operating revenue for the year ended december  the improvement in fasi s results from operations was primarily driven by lower health and workers compensation losses  the discontinuance of low yield business and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and control variable and controllable costs such as cargo claims 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  and decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the maturity of capital lease arrangements and the corresponding decrease in associated interest expense 
other  net other  net was income of million for the years ended december  and 
table of contents provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the reenactment of certain tax credits which originally expired in but were extended through and made retroactive for at this time the related tax credits have expired and will not be available in  unless extended by congress 
further reducing our effective tax rate was a million reduction of income tax contingency reserves due to the lapsing of statutes on certain state income tax filings 
finally  contributing to the decrease in our effective tax rate is the increase in our net income before income taxes combined with reductions in non deductible expenses such as share based compensation for incentive stock options 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at for forward air and for fasi 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the preceding twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 

table of contents self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and employee health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and employee health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
we utilize semi annual actuarial analysis to evaluate the open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
changes in the inputs described above  such as claim life cycles  severity of claims and trends in loss costs  can result in material changes to our self insurance loss reserves 
historically  significant changes in one assumption or changes in several assumptions have resulted in both increases and decreases to self insurance loss reserves 
based on facts and circumstances one significant claim  such as a dock or vehicle accident  could result in an immediate increase in our self insurance loss reserves of at least million to million  our self insured retention limits 
significant facts and circumstances for a claim would involve the degree of injuries  whether fatalities occurred  the amount of property damage  the degree of our involvement and whether or not our employees or representatives followed our processes and procedures 
however  changes in the above variables could also reduce our self insurance loss reserves 
for example  during the second quarter of  we reduced our workers compensation loss reserve by approximately million as the result of improvements in our loss experience and in the severity of claims incurred over a certain period of time 
revenue recognition operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are completed 
the transportation rates we charge our customers consist of base transportation rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the revenues earned and related direct freight expenses incurred from our base transportation services are recognized on a gross basis in revenue and in purchased transportation 
transportation revenue is recognized on a gross basis as we are the primary obligor 
the fuel surcharges billed to customers and paid to owner operators and third party transportation providers are recorded on a net basis in revenue as we are not the primary obligor with regards to the fuel surcharges 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
also  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million for certain legal entities that will expire between and the use of these state net operating losses is limited to the future taxable income of separate legal entities 
based on expectations of future taxable income  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations for the related legal entities will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net operating loss benefits for these state loss carryforwards 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been provided for these state loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance on these certain state loss carryforwards was approximately million at december  valuation of goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
examples of such events or circumstances could include a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers 
we complete our annual analysis of our reporting units as of the last day of our second quarter  june th 
we first consider our operating segment and related components in accordance with us gaap 
goodwill is allocated to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combinations generating the goodwill 
we have two reporting units forward air and fasi 
in evaluating reporting units  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the 
table of contents fair value of either of its reporting units is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
when performing the qualitative assessment  we consider the impact of factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic and industry conditions  overall financial performance of each reporting unit  litigation and new legislation 
if based on the qualitative assessments  we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit is less than the reporting unit carrying amount we will prepare an estimation of the respective reporting unit fair value 
if this estimation of fair value indicates that impairment potentially exists  we will then measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the calculated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of a market approach  which considers comparable companies  and the income approach  using a discounted cash flow model 
under the market approach  valuation multiples are derived based on a selection of comparable companies and applied to projected operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of management prepared projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted using a rate which reflects our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant  and is adjusted for appropriate risk factors 
we believe the most sensitive estimate used in our income approach is the management prepared projected cash flows 
consequently  we perform sensitivity tests to ensure reductions of the present value of the projected cash flows by at least would not adversely impact the results of the goodwill impairment tests 
historically  we have equally weighted the income and market approaches as we believed the quality and quantity of the collected information were approximately equal 
in  based on our qualitative assessment we did not perform an estimation of forward air fair value  but did perform a fair value estimation for fasi 
in  we performed a fair value calculation for forward air which indicated that the fair value of forward air exceeded the book value by almost 
our calculations for fasi indicated that  as of june   the fair value of fasi exceeded their carrying value by approximately 
for our analysis the significant assumptions used for the income approach were years of projected net cash flows  discount rate of and a long term growth rate of 
these estimates used to calculate the fair value of fasi change from year to year based on operating results  market conditions  and other factors 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit fair value and goodwill impairment for the reporting unit 
for example  during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations  fasi operating losses in excess of expectations and reductions of projected net cash flows 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  based on the results of the interim impairment test  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
consequently  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of earnings estimated to be generated by our forward air segment are expected to continue supporting the million carrying value of its goodwill 
our fasi segment is currently facing the challenges of building  expanding and diversifying its revenue base 
if fasi efforts are significantly delayed  future estimates of projected financial information may again be significantly reduced  and we may be required to record an impairment charge up to the million carrying value of fasi goodwill 
share based compensation our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
for employees  we have granted stock options  non vested shares and performance shares 
for non employee directors  we have granted non vested shares annually beginning in stock options typically expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for stock options are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical experience 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted 
the following table contains the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

table of contents december  december  december  expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate expected life of options years the fair value of non vested shares issued were estimated using the closing market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period or vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
we have also granted performance shares to key employees 
under the terms of the performance share agreements  on the third anniversary of the grant date  we will issue to the employees a calculated number of common stock shares based on the three year performance of our common stock share price as compared to the share price performance of a selected peer group 
no shares may be issued if the share price performance outperforms or less of the peer group  but the number of shares issued may be doubled if the share price performs better than of the peer group 
the share based compensation for performance shares are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
the fair value of the performance shares was estimated using a monte carlo simulation 
the following table contains the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of performance shares granted 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
year ended december  december  expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate under the espp  which has been approved by our shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
operating leases certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term 
for these leases  we recognize the related rental expenses on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which includes any rent holiday period  and records the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amount paid as rent as a rent liability 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial term of the lease 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital expenditures  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to increases in cash used for estimated tax payments  trade accounts payable and prepaid assets 
due to increases in our income from operations over recent years we had to increase our estimated federal and state income tax prepayments in by million compared to the timing of payments associated with trade accounts payable and prepaid assets accounted for an additional million increase in cash used for operations 
these increases in cash used were partially offset by a million increase in earnings after consideration of non cash items and a million increase in cash collected from accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable 
table of contents to a million increase in net earnings after consideration of non cash items and a million decrease in cash used to fund payables and other assets 
these sources of cash were offset by a million reduction in cash provided by accounts receivable 
the decrease in cash used to fund payables and other assets was primarily attributable to increased income taxes payable as current income tax expenses increased by a larger amount than our estimated tax payments 
the decrease in cash from accounts receivable is largely attributable to the increase in business volumes during the year ended december   resulting in revenues that were not collected until early net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  investing activities during the years ended december  and consisted primarily of capital expenditures for new tractors  trailers and vehicles to replace aging units 
the million and million of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment for the years ended december  and  respectively  were primarily from sales of older vehicles replaced by the and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was attributable to increased capital expenditures for new trailers and other rolling stock 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and increased million compared with million used in financing activities during the year ended december  the increase in cash from financing activities is mainly attributable to the year ended december  including a million payment on our line of credit and million of common stock share repurchases 
in addition  during the year ended december   cash received from the exercise of stock options increased million compared to the year ended december  these increases from financing activities were partially offset by a million increase in dividend payments 
dividends increased on new shares issued through stock option exercises and our board of directors during the third quarter of increasing the quarterly cash dividend from our historic per share to per share 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  mainly included a million payment on our line of credit  million used for the repurchase of our common stock  million used for our quarterly dividend payments and million of scheduled capital lease payments 
the increase from the year ended december  to december  in cash used for financing activities is attributable to the payment on our line of credit and the repurchases of our shares during there was no comparable activity in these uses of cash were partially offset by a million increase in cash from the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit compared to in february  we entered into a new million credit facility 
this facility has a term of five years and matures in february interest rates for advances under the facility are libor plus based upon covenants related to total indebtedness to earnings at december  
the agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions related to new indebtedness  investment types and dispositions of property 
none of the covenants are expected to significantly affect our operations or ability to pay dividends 
no assets are pledged as collateral against the credit facility 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   we had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit and had million of available borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
in july  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program repurchase plan for up to two million shares of our common stock 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock under the repurchase plan for million  or an average cost of per share 
as of december    shares remain that may be repurchased under the repurchase plan 
during the first and second quarters of and each quarter of and  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
during the third and fourth quarter of  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
we believe that our available cash  investments  expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under the available credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions that can increase our penetration of a geographic area  add new customers  add new business verticals  increase freight volume and add new service offerings 
in addition  we expect to explore acquisitions that 
table of contents may enable us to offer additional services 
acquisitions may affect our short term cash flow  liquidity and net income as we expend funds  potentially increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from banks totaling million required primarily by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period and total thereafter capital lease obligations equipment purchase commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations not included in the above table are reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and for self insurance claims of million and million  respectively 
the equipment purchase commitments are for various trailers  vehicles and forklifts 
all of the above commitments are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  as defined in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act

we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our credit facility 
the credit facility  for which no balance was outstanding at or during december   bears interest at variable rates 
however  based on our average outstanding borrowings during  a hypothetical increase in our credit facility borrowing rate of basis points  or an increase in the total effective interest rate from to  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately million 
our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling million 
these lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations
