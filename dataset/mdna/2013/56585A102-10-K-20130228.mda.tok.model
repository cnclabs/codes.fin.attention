pipeline transportation as of december   we owned  leased or had ownership interests in approximately  miles of crude oil and products pipelines  of which approximately  miles are owned through our investments in mplx and pipe line holdings 
the acquisition of approximately miles of natural gas liquid pipelines on february  increased the total mile count to approximately  miles 
mplx in  we formed mplx  a master limited partnership  to own  operate  develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil  refined products and other hydrocarbon based products 
on october   mplx completed its initial public offering 
we own a percent interest in mplx  including the general partner interest 
mplx s assets consist of a percent general partner interest in pipe line holdings  which owns common carrier pipeline systems through marathon pipe line llc mpl and ohio river pipe line llc orpl  and a percent interest in a one million barrel butane storage cavern in west virginia

the pipelines are each eight inches in diameter and have a total capacity of approximately mbpd 
competition  market conditions and seasonality the downstream petroleum business is highly competitive  particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products 
we compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products 
based upon the the oil gas journal worldwide refinery survey and our acquisition of the galveston bay refinery on february   we ranked fourth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of february  we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products wholesale  spot  branded and retail distribution 
we believe we compete with about companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers  including private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers  about companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market  refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded dealers and jobbers  and approximately retailers in the retail sale of refined products 
in addition  we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
we do not produce any of the crude oil we refine 

table of contents we also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline  diesel fuel and merchandise 
our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their dealers and jobbers and other well recognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers  often selling gasoline  diesel fuel and merchandise at aggressively competitive prices 
non traditional retailers  such as supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants  have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business 
energy analysts international  inc estimates such retailers had percent of the us gasoline market in our pipeline transportation operations are highly regulated  which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines 
market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations 
our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil  natural gas and refined products  as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve 
price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect our operating results 
demand for gasoline  diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets  primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction 
as a result  the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year 
environmental matters our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and for reviewing our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs 
we also have a corporate emergency response team  composed primarily of senior management  which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities 
we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue  with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations 
currently  various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review  discussion or implementation 
the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time  but could be significant 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors 
we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products we produce 
additionally  we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 
our operations are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include  among others  the clean air act with respect to air emissions  the clean water act with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of opa with respect to oil pollution and response 
in addition  many states where we operate have similar laws 
new laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis  and the costs of compliance with any new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate at this time 
for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air  water  solid waste and remediation  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters and compliance costs 

table of contents air we are subject to substantial requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations 
the us environmental protection agency epa issued an endangerment finding in that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare 
related to this endangerment finding  in april  the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emissions standard for mobile sources cars and light duty vehicles 
the endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and the epa s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act  and the epa s so called tailoring rule led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions  including refineries 
legal challenges filed against these epa actions were overruled by the dc circuit court of appeals  but several parties will seek further review by the us supreme court 
we also expect refinery specific new source performance standards will be proposed in congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax 
private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions  but we have not been named in any of those lawsuits 
private party litigation is also pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken 
although there may be an adverse financial impact including compliance costs  potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for certain refined products made from crude oil associated with any legislation  regulation  litigation or other action  the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 
of particular significance to our refining operations were epa mobile source air toxics ii msat ii regulations that require reduced benzene levels in refined products 
we spent approximately million over a four year period to complete all msat ii projects  and all units were in operation as of december  the epa has reviewed and has revised or will propose to revise the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for criteria air pollutants 
the naaqs are subject to multiple court challenges  making final compliance plans uncertain 
the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march and commenced a multi year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act 
in  the epa is expected to propose a stricter ozone standard as part of epa s periodic review of that standard 
also  in  the epa adopted new short term standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide  and in december issued a more stringent fine particulate matter pm standard 
we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these proposed and revised naaqs standards until the standards are finalized  individual state implementing rules are established and judicial challenges are resolved 
in december  the epa signed final reconsideration amendments to the boiler and process heater maximum achievable control technology boiler mact rule 
this rule had been finalized in march with work practice standards that are applicable to refinery and natural gas fired equipment 
while epa retained the work practice standards for most refinery equipment  we are currently evaluating the financial impact of the boiler mact rule as a result of the reconsideration amendments 
further changes to the rule may occur because of potential litigation 
in  the epa is expected to propose a refinery sector rule 
this rule may require various refinery unit modifications  additional controls  lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring 
we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of this rule until it is proposed and finalized 
water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the clean water act and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts 
in addition  we are regulated under opa  which among other requirements  requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances 
also  in case of any such release  opa requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages 
opa also 
table of contents provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions 
we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa and we have established spill prevention  control and countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements 
additionally  opa requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double hulled be retrofitted or removed from us service  according to a phase out schedule 
all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double hulled requirements of opa we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur 
some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa  but with expanded liability provisions  including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 
solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations 
rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes 
besides affecting waste disposal practices  rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations  the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks usts containing regulated substances 
we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite third party treatment and disposal facilities 
ongoing rcra related costs  however  are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows 
remediation we own or operate  or have owned or operated  certain retail outlets where  during the normal course of operations  releases of refined products from usts have occurred 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states  which administer their own ust programs 
our obligation to remediate such contamination varies  depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate 
a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied 
we also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery  terminal and pipeline locations 
penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance 
claims under cercla and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean up of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to facilitate the clean up of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with cercla  however  we do not believe such costs will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
mileage standards  renewable fuels and other fuels requirements in  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act eisa  which  among other things  set a target of miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year  and contains a second renewable fuel standard the rfs 
in august  the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry 
table of contents fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to miles per gallon by model year and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to miles per gallon by model year the standards from to are the government s current estimate but will require further rulemaking 
the rfs requires billion gallons of renewable fuel usage in  increasing to billion gallons by in the near term  the rfs will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline 
the rfs presents production and logistic challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries 
the rfs has required  and may in the future continue to require  additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use 
within the overall billion gallon rfs  eisa established an advanced biofuel rfs volume of billion gallons in increasing to billion gallons in subsets within the advanced biofuel rfs include biomass based diesel  which was set at billion gallons in and at least billion gallons in through to be determined by the epa through future rulemaking  and cellulosic biofuel  which was set at billion gallons in  billion gallons in  increasing to billion gallons by the epa established the biomass based diesel requirement at billion gallons 
the epa determined that billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel would not be produced in  and lowered the requirement to million gallons 
the american petroleum institute challenged the epa cellulosic biofuel requirement and the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the requirement finding that it was unlawfully determined and remanded it for further determination 
the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels  including biomass based diesel and cellulosic biofuel  with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels 
the advanced requirement for required a substantial level of brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports since other sources of advanced renewable fuels were not available 
in  the epa also discovered that million biodiesel renewable identification numbers rins used to meet the annual requirement for that fuel had been fraudulently created and sold to unsuspecting third parties  including us 
we made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel rfs requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product  and by buying needed biodiesel rins in the epa created biodiesel rins market 
on october   the epa issued a partial waiver decision under the clean air act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from percent e to percent e for and newer light duty motor vehicles 
on january   the epa issued a second waiver for the use of e in vehicles model year there are numerous issues  including state and federal regulatory issues  which need to be addressed before e can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines 
there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in eisa and related regulations 
we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 
the epa tier gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline but it may also lower the reid vapor pressure  and the allowable benzene  aromatics and olefins content of gasoline  while possibly increasing octane requirements 
we anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in and plan to participate in the public comment process

table of contents item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k in evaluating us and our common stock 
some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate  while others relate principally to our spinoff from marathon oil  the ownership of our common stock and securities markets generally 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks  and  as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks relating to our industry and our business failure to identify and manage risks inherent in our industry could adversely impact our business 
our business requires us to identify and manage the risks inherent to the refining  marketing and transportation business in which we operate 
our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned maintenance or events such as explosions  fires  refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents  severe weather and labor disputes 
such incidents may result in personal injury  loss of life  environmental damage  legal liability and loss of revenue 
failure to identify and manage these risks could result in explosions  fires  refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents resulting in personal injury  loss of life  environmental damage  property damage  legal liability  loss of revenue and substantial fines by governmental authorities 
a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing gross margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 
our operating results  cash flows  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products 
the measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil  or crack spread  is commonly used by the industry as a proxy for refining and marketing gross margins 
historically  refining and marketing gross margins have been volatile and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future 
our margins and cost of producing gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions  including the price of crude oil 
we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine 
the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market conditions 
the overall change in crack spreads will impact our refining and marketing gross margins 
many of the factors influencing the change in crack spreads and refining and marketing gross margins are beyond our control 
these factors include worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products  the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products  the prices realized for refined products  utilization rates of refineries  natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries  the ability of the members of the opec to agree to and maintain production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  
table of contents local weather conditions  seasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months  natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados  the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and local  regional  national and worldwide economic conditions 
some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly  adding to market volatility  while others may have longer term effects 
the longer term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing gross margins are uncertain 
we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before refining them and selling the refined products 
price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results 
we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers 
price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
lower refining and marketing gross margins may reduce the amount of refined product we produce  which may reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flows 
significant reductions in refining and marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 
the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing gross margins 
the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products 
a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies  producing companies and trading companies  including suppliers from canada  the middle east and various other international locations 
we are  therefore  subject to the political  geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in  and supplies originating from  those areas 
if one or more of our major supply sources were eliminated  or if political events disrupted our traditional crude oil supply  we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available  but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply 
if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices  our operations  sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected  materially and adversely impacting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
worldwide political and economic developments could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to impacting crude oil and other feedstock supplies  political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways 
hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states the us and other developed countries 
a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 
these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products 
additionally  these risks could increase instability in the 
table of contents financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate 
additionally  tax policy  legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability 
the us government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products or the conduct of business with certain foreign countries 
changes in environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
various laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations  which may reduce our refining and marketing gross margin 
laws and regulations relating to the emission or discharge of materials into the environment  solid and hazardous waste management  pollution prevention  greenhouse gas emissions and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels  as well as those relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security  in particular  are expected to become more stringent 
the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of operating facilities  marketing areas  crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes 
we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations  install pollution control equipment  perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention  with the potential for further laws and regulations that could affect our operations 
the us pledge in  as part of the copenhagen accord  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below levels by  remains in effect 
meetings of the united nations climate change conference  however  have produced no legally binding emission reduction requirements on the us also in  the epa issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare 
related to the endangerment finding  in april  the epa finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources cars and other light duty vehicles 
the endangerment finding  the mobile source standard and the epa s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the clean air act and the epa s so called tailoring rule led to permitting of larger stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions  including refineries 
we also expect refinery specific new source performance standards will be proposed in legal challenges were filed against these epa actions 
the dc circuit court of appeals overruled these challenges but several parties will seek further review by the us supreme court 
in the future  congress may again consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax 
other measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review or implementation in the us these measures include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions 
private party litigation is pending against federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken 
these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities  capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs  reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 
the eisa  among other things  sets a target of miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the us by model year and contains a second renewable fuel standard commonly referred to as rfs in august  the epa and the national highway traffic safety administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to miles per gallon by model year and of up to miles per gallon by model year the standards from to are the government s current estimate but will require further rulemaking 
increases in fuel mileage standards and the increased use of renewable fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels may reduce demand for refined products 

table of contents the rfs required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the us to reach billion gallons in and increases to billion gallons by the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries  and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use 
the advanced biofuels program  a subset of the rfs requirements  creates uncertainties and presents challenges of supply  and may require that we and other refiners and other obligated parties purchase credits from the epa to meet our obligations 
tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been  which may further reduce refined product margins 
the epa tier gasoline rulemaking could potentially lower the allowable sulfur level in gasoline  but it may also lower the reid vapor pressure  and the allowable benzene  aromatics and olefins content of gasoline  while possibly increasing octane requirements 
we anticipate a proposed rule will be issued in and plan to participate in the public comment process 
we have in the past owned or operated  and currently own and operate  convenience stores and other locations with usts in various states 
the operation of usts poses risks  including soil and groundwater contamination  at our previously or currently operated locations 
such contamination could result in substantial cleanup costs  fines or civil liabilities 
we have in the past and will continue to dispose of various wastes at lawful disposal sites 
environmental laws  including cercla  and similar state laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party  without regard to negligence or fault  and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when performed 
any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  injunctions limiting our operations  investigatory or remedial liabilities or impediments to construction of additional facilities or equipment 
compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial performance 
we are subject to extensive tax liabilities  including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise  sales and use  payroll  franchise  withholding and property taxes 
new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial performance 
additionally  many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities  and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties 
competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks  have more extensive retail outlets or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage 
we do not produce any of our crude oil supply 
some of our competitors  however  obtain a significant portion of their crude oil from their own exploration and production activities 
competitors that have their own exploration and production activities may at times be able to offset losses from downstream operations with profits from upstream operations  and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refined product margins or feedstock shortages 
some of our competitors also have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have 
those competitors may have a greater ability to respond to volatile industry or market conditions  such as shortages of crude oil or other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations 

table of contents the retail market is diverse and highly competitive  and severe competition could adversely impact our business 
we also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline  diesel and merchandise 
our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers  and other well recognized national or regional retail outlets  often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices 
several non traditional retailers such as supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business 
these non traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow 
because of their diversity  integration of operations  experienced management and greater resources  these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market 
in addition  these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts  both at the pump and in the store  to encourage in store merchandise sales 
these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts  adversely affecting our profit margins 
additionally  the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 
we do not insure against all such potential losses  and  therefore  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 
our operations are subject to business interruption due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and to unplanned events such as explosions  fires  refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents or unplanned maintenance  severe weather and labor disputes 
for example  our pipelines provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to  or refined products from  some of our refineries 
in such instances  a prolonged interruption in service of such a pipeline could materially and adversely affect the operations  profitability and cash flows of the connected refinery 
our operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property and equipment  environmental pollution  impairment of operations and substantial losses to us 
damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 
in addition  our information technology systems and network infrastructure are subject to unauthorized access or attack  which could result in the loss of sensitive business information  systems interruptions or the disruption of our business operations 
to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack  we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans 
the level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site  and there can be no guarantee such plans  to the extent they are in place  will be totally effective 
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many  but not all  potential liabilities arising from operating hazards 
uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
historically  we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities  with significant self insured retentions 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance coverage have increased substantially and could escalate further 
certain insurance coverage could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  due to hurricane activity in recent years  the availability of insurance coverage for our facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced 

table of contents we are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third party transportation of crude oil and refined products 
we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries 
in addition to our own operational risks discussed above  we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events  accidents  governmental regulations or third party actions 
a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined product to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain levels  we could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the shipping act of and merchant marine act of  which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws  generally require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens 
among other requirements to establish citizenship  corporations that own such vessels must be owned at least by us citizens 
if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws  we would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us inland waters 
such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward contract activities and derivative transactions 
we currently use commodity derivative instruments and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future 
a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions 
to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective  we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred 
we have substantial debt obligations  therefore our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile  a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us  or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally 
on february   we completed the offering of senior notes aggregating billion in principal amount 
at december   our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations was billion 
we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future 
our indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to changing economic  regulatory and industry conditions  limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds  and requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes 

table of contents a decrease in our debt and commercial credit capacity  including unsecured credit extended by third party suppliers  or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate 
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future 
our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities  products liability  consumer credit or privacy laws  product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations 
while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us  in class action litigation large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages 
attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims  including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages 
we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future 
if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation  it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities 
in addition to substantial liability  plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which  if imposed  could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a portion of our workforce is unionized  and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
approximately percent of our refining employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our detroit and texas city refineries are scheduled to expire in january and march  respectively 
the contracts for the hourly refinery workers at our canton  catlettsburg and galveston bay refineries are each scheduled to expire in january these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us or we may experience work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements 
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership  mplx  which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations 
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx  a publicly traded master limited partnership 
our control of the general partner of mplx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx 
any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
significant transactions  including the galveston bay refinery and related assets acquisition  are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business  financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
any significant transaction  including the galveston bay refinery and related assets acquisition  involves potential risks  including  among other things the validity of our assumptions about future synergies  revenues  capital expenditures and operating costs  an inability to successfully integrate any asset or businesses we acquire  
table of contents a decrease in our liquidity by using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions  the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities  losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the incurrence of other significant charges  such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets  asset devaluation or restructuring charges 
risks relating to our spinoff from marathon oil we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities and temporary limitations pursuant to the tax sharing agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
although the spinoff occurred in mid  certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations 
for example  under the internal revenue code of the code and related rules and regulations  each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period 
in connection with the spinoff  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil 
however  if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible  we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes 
other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters  including laws governing tax qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities 
also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries  whether accruing before  on or after the spinoff 
we also agreed to be responsible for  and indemnify marathon oil with respect to  all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff or certain internal restructuring transactions failing to qualify as transactions under sections a and of the code for us federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation  warranty  covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified tax related liabilities associated with our acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries  officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap 
if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement  we may be subject to substantial liabilities 
at this time  we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts 
the tax liabilities described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our company 
under the tax sharing agreement we could be limited for a period of time in our ability to pursue certain strategic or capital raising transactions 
in addition  under some circumstances  we could be liable for any adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in such transactions 
even if the spinoff s status as a tax free distribution under section of the code remains intact  the spinoff may result in significant us federal income tax 
table of contents liabilities to marathon oil under applicable provisions of the code if percent or more of marathon oil s stock or our stock is treated as having been acquired  directly or indirectly  by one or more persons as part of a plan that includes the spinoff 
under those provisions  any acquisitions of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions  or any understanding  arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding an acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock or similar acquisitions  within two years before or after the spinoff are subject to special scrutiny 
the process for determining whether an acquisition triggering those provisions has occurred is complex  inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case 
if a direct or indirect acquisition of marathon oil stock or our stock resulted in a change in control as contemplated by those provisions  marathon oil but not its stockholders would recognize a taxable gain 
under the tax sharing agreement  there are also restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the separation to fail to qualify as a tax free distribution  and we are required to indemnify marathon oil against any such tax liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us or any of our affiliates  or any person that  after the spinoff  is our affiliate 
we may be similarly liable if we breach certain other representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement 
we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to issue shares of our stock without satisfying certain conditions within the tax sharing agreement 
as a result of the foregoing  we may be unable to engage in strategic or capital raising transactions that our stockholders might consider favorable  or to structure potential transactions in the manner most favorable to us  without adverse tax consequences  if at all 
the spinoff could be determined not to qualify as a tax free transaction  and marathon oil and its stockholders could be subject to material amounts of taxes and  in certain circumstances  we could be required to indemnify marathon oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement 
marathon oil received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs  to the effect that  among other things  the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spinoff qualifies as tax free to marathon oil  us and marathon oil stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections and a and related provisions of the code 
if the factual assumptions or representations made in the private letter ruling request are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect  then marathon oil would not be able to continue to rely on the ruling 
we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause the assumptions or representations that were relied on in the private letter ruling to be inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect 
if  notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling  the spinoff were determined not to qualify under section of the code  marathon oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold its shares of common stock of our company in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize a taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over its tax basis in such shares 
with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed on marathon oil in connection with the spinoff and certain related transactions as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences as set forth in the private letter ruling  we would be liable to marathon oil under the tax sharing agreement for any such taxes or liabilities attributable to actions taken by or with respect to us  any of our affiliates  or any person that  after the spinoff  is our affiliate 
we may be similarly liable if we breach specified representations or covenants set forth in the tax sharing agreement 
if we are required to indemnify marathon oil for taxes incurred as a result of the spinoff or certain related transactions being taxable to marathon oil  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have potential liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil in connection with the spinoff that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in connection with the spinoff  we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for  among other things  the principal corporate transactions that were required to affect the spinoff  certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon 
table of contents oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff 
among other things  the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities  whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff  as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us 
our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities 
marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities 
however  third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff 
moreover  even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or it insurers any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
if marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations  the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company  dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity 
the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these include provisions providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board  providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms  providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies  limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our amended and restated bylaws  providing that our directors may only be removed for cause  authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued  which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management  thereby protecting the continuity of our management  or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us  and authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt 
we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time 
table of contents to assess any acquisition proposal  and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation  powers  preferences and relative  participating  optional and other special rights  including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as our board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock 
for example  we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions 
similarly  the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock 
finally  to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws  our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non us citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to percent of the outstanding shares 
we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non us citizens to exceed percent 
our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock 
these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non us citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non us citizens 
any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock
