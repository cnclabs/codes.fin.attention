item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our business we are a real estate services company engaged primarily in the servicing of residential loans for others and the origination and selling or securitization of single family conforming mortgage loans to gses or other third party investors in the secondary market 
nationstar  our principal operating subsidiary  is a leading high touch non bank residential mortgage servicer with a broad array of servicing capabilities across the residential mortgage product spectrum 
we have been the fastest growing mortgage servicer since as measured by annual percentage growth in upb  having grown annually on a compounded basis 
as of december   we serviced over million residential mortgage loans with an aggregate upb of billion  making us the largest non bank servicer in the united states as of december  we service loans as the owner of the msrs  which we refer to as primary servicing  and we also service loans on behalf of other msr or mortgage owners  which we refer to as subservicing 
we acquire msrs on a standalone basis and have also developed an innovative model for investing on a capital light basis by co investing with financial partners in excess msrs 
subservicing represents another capital light means of growing our servicing business  as subservicing contracts are typically awarded on a no cost basis and do not require substantial capital 
as of december   our primary servicing and subservicing  represented and  respectively of our total servicing portfolio  with of our outstanding servicing portfolio consisting of reverse residential mortgage loans 
in addition  we operate several adjacent real estate services businesses designed to meet the changing needs of the mortgage industry which we have named solutionstar 
these businesses offer an array of ancillary services  including providing services for delinquent loans  managing loans in the foreclosure reo real estate owned process and providing title insurance agency  loan settlement and valuation services on newly originated and re originated loans 
we operate a fully integrated loan originations platform to complement and enhance our servicing business 
we originate primarily conventional agency gse and government insured residential mortgage loans and  to mitigate risk  typically sell these loans within days while retaining the associated servicing rights 
our originations efforts are primarily focused on re origination  which involves actively working with existing borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans 
by re originating loans for existing borrowers  we retain the servicing rights  thereby extending the longevity of the servicing cash flows  which we refer to as recapture 
we also have a legacy asset portfolio  which consists primarily of non prime and nonconforming residential mortgage loans  most of which we originated from april to july in november  we engaged in a transaction through which we term financed our legacy assets with a nonrecourse loan that requires no additional capital or equity contributions 
additionally  we consolidated certain securitization trusts where it was determined that we had both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entities vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie pursuant to consolidation accounting guidance related to vies adopted on january  the analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as discussed herein is primarily focused on the combined results of our two operating segments the servicing segment and the originations segment 
critical accounting policies various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified four policies that  due to the judgment  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to a fair value measurements b sale of mortgage loans c accounting for mortgage loans held for investment  subject to nonrecourse debt and d valuation of deferred tax asset 
we believe that the judgment  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
fair value measurements include i the valuation of mortgage loans held for sale  ii the valuation of mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt  iii the valuation of msrs  iv the valuation of derivative instruments  v the valuation of abs nonrecourse debt  and vi the valuation of excess spread financing 

table of contents fair value measurements i mortgage loans held for sale we have elected to measure newly originated conventional residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value 
we estimate fair value by evaluating a variety of market indicators including recent trades and outstanding commitments to purchase loans  calculated on an aggregate basis 
ii mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt we determine the fair value on loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt using internally developed valuation models 
these valuation models estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the loan s principal market 
although we utilize and give priority to observable market inputs  such as interest rates and market spreads within these models  we typically are required to utilize internal inputs  such as prepayment speeds  credit losses and discount rates 
these internal inputs require the use of our judgment and can have a significant impact on the determination of the loan s fair value 
in december  we sold our remaining variable interest in a securitization trust that had been a consolidated vie since january  and deconsolidated the vie 
upon deconsolidation of this vie  we derecognized the securitized mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt 
iii msrs at fair value we recognize msrs related to all existing forward residential mortgage loans transferred to a third party in a transfer that meets the requirements for sale accounting 
additionally  we may acquire the rights to service forward residential mortgage loans through the purchase of these rights from third parties 
we apply fair value accounting to this class of msrs  with all changes in fair value recorded as a charge or credit to servicing fee income in the consolidated statement of operations 
we estimate the fair value of these msrs using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value 
the cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on various factors  with the key assumptions being mortgage prepayment speeds  discount rates and credit losses 
we use internal financial models that use  wherever possible  market participant data to value these msrs 
these models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates 
in addition  the modeling requirements of msrs are complex because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with msrs 
even if the general accuracy of our valuation models is validated  valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the models 
on a periodic basis  a majority of these msrs are reviewed by an outside valuation expert 
iv derivative financial instruments we utilize certain derivative instruments in the ordinary course of our business to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
these derivative instruments include forward sales of mbs  forward loan sale commitments and interest rate swaps and caps 
we also issue interest rate lock commitments irlcs to borrowers in connection with single family mortgage loan originations we intend to sell 
we recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated statement of financial position at fair value 
the estimated fair values of forward sales of mbs and interest rate swaps and caps are based on the exchange price or dealer market price and are recorded as other assets or derivative financial instruments liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the initial and subsequent changes in value on forward sales of mbs are a component of gain on mortgage loans held for sale in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
the estimated fair values of irlcs  loan purchase commitments lpcs  and forward sale commitments are based on the fair value of related mortgage loans which is based on observable market date 
fair value amounts of irlcs are adjusted for expected execution of outstanding loan commitments 
irlcs and lpc are recorded in other assets and forward sale commitments are recorded as a component of mortgage loans held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet 
the initial and subsequent changes in value of irlcs  lpcs  and forward sale commitments are a component of gain on mortgage loans held for sale in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
v abs nonrecourse debt effective january   accounting guidance related to vies eliminated the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  and all existing special purpose entities spes are subject to the new consolidation guidance 
upon adoption of this new accounting guidance  we identified certain securitization trusts where we  through our affiliates  continued to hold beneficial interests in these trusts 
these retained beneficial interests obligate us to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant 
in addition  as master servicer on the related mortgage loans  we retain the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie 
when it is determined that we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie  the assets and liabilities of these vies are included in our consolidated financial statements 
upon consolidation of these vies  we 
table of contents derecognized all previously recognized beneficial interests obtained as part of the securitization  including any retained investment in debt securities  and any remaining residual interests 
in addition  we recognized the securitized mortgage loans as mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt  and the related asset backed certificates acquired by third parties as abs nonrecourse debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
we estimate the fair value of abs nonrecourse debt based on the present value of future expected discounted cash flows with the discount rate approximating current market value for similar financial instruments 
in december  we sold our remaining variable interest in a securitization trust that had been a consolidated vie since january  and deconsolidated the variable interest 
upon deconsolidation of this vie in  we derecognized the related abs nonrecourse debt 
vi excess spread financing in conjunction with the acquisition of certain of our msrs  we enter into a sale and assignment agreements  which we treat as a financing with an affiliated entity of fortress investment group  whereby we sell the right to receive a portion of the excess cash flow generated from a certain underlying msr portfolio after receipt of a fixed basic servicing fee per loan 
we retain all ancillary income associated with servicing the portfolio and the remaining portion of the excess cash flow after receipt of the fixed basic servicing fee 
we measure this financing arrangement at fair value to more accurately represent the future economic performance of the acquired msrs and related excess servicing financing 
we estimate the fair value of this financing using a process that combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data based on the value of the underlying msrs 
sale of mortgage loans transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered by us 
control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when i the assets have been isolated from us  ii the transferee has the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets  and iii we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either a an agreement that entitles and obligates us to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or b the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets 
loan securitizations structured as sales as well as whole loan sales are accounted for as sales of mortgage loans and the resulting gains or losses on such sales  net of any accrual for standard representations and warranties  are reported in operating results as a component of gain on mortgage loans held for sale in the consolidated statement of operations during the period in which the securitization closes or the sale occurs 
mortgage loans held for investment  subject to nonrecourse debt we account for the loans that were transferred to held for investment from held for sale during october in a manner that is required by asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
at the date of transfer  we evaluated such loans to determine whether there was evidence of deterioration of credit quality since acquisition and if it was probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
the transferred loans were aggregated into separate pools of loans based on common risk characteristics loan delinquency 
we consider expected prepayments  and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows for each aggregated pool of loans 
the determination of expected cash flows utilizes internal inputs such as prepayment speeds and credit losses 
these internal inputs require the use of judgment and can have a significant impact on the accretion of income and or valuation allowance 
we determine the excess of the pool s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over all cash flows expected as of the transfer date as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the remaining amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the pool of loans accretable yield 
the difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected and the investment in the loan is recognized as interest income on a level yield method over the life of the loan 
increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the transfer are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the yield on the loans over the remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to transfer are recognized as a valuation allowance 
valuation of deferred tax asset our provision for income taxes is calculated using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in the valuation allowance 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the adequacy of the valuation allowance  we consider all forms of evidence  including historic earnings or losses  the ability to realize deferred tax assets through carry back to prior periods  anticipated taxable income resulting from the reversal of taxable temporary 
table of contents differences  tax planning strategies  and anticipated future earnings exclusive of the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
results of operations below is a summarization of our consolidated operating results for the periods indicated 
we provide further discussion of our results of operations for each of our reportable segments under segment results below 
certain income and expenses not allocated to our reportable segments are presented under legacy portfolio and other below and discussed in note business segment reporting in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

the increase in our total fee income was primarily the result of our higher average forward servicing portfolio balance of billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december   and an increase in modification fees earned from hamp and other non hamp modifications 
also included in our results was million in reverse mortgage service fee income 
there was no reverse mortgage service fee income in and the increase in the gain on loans held for sale was a result of the billion  or  increase in the amount of loans originated during the period compared to the period and higher margins earned on the sale of residential mortgage loans during the period 
expenses and impairments increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the increase in compensation expenses related to increased staffing levels in order to accommodate our larger servicing portfolio and originations volumes as well as other related increases in general and administrative expenses 
other expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in our net interest margin resulting from higher average outstanding balances on our outstanding warehouse and advance facilities and the interest expense related to the increase in our unsecured senior notes during additionally  we recognized a loss on equity investment of million during compared to million in the increase in the loss relates to the decision to wind down the operation of the underlying entity 
see note related party disclosure 
these amounts were partially offset by our recording of a million contract termination fee related to a potential acquisition of certain assets of a financial services company in bankruptcy 
because we were not the highest bidder in the bankruptcy auction  we earned a break up fee 
we recorded this fee net of the amount we paid our co investment partner in the potential acquisition

table of contents our primary business strategy is to generate recurring  stable income from managing and growing our servicing portfolio 
we operate through two business segments the servicing segment and the originations segment  which we refer to collectively as our operating segments 
we report the activity not related to either operating segment in legacy portfolio and other 
legacy portfolio and other includes primarily all subprime mortgage loans i originated mostly from april to july or ii acquired from chec  and vies which were consolidated pursuant to the january  adoption of consolidation guidance related to vies 
as of december  and thereafter  we had no consolidated vies 
the accounting policies of each reportable segment are the same as those of the consolidated financial statements except for i expenses for consolidated back office operations and general overhead expenses such as executive administration and accounting  ii revenues generated on inter segment services performed  and iii interest expense on unsecured senior notes 
expenses are allocated to individual segments based on the estimated value of services performed  including total revenue contributions  personnel headcount  and the equity invested in each segment 
revenues generated or inter segment services performed are valued based on similar services provided to external parties 
all tables in this section are presented in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
servicing segment the servicing segment provides loan servicing on our primary and subservicing portfolios  including the collection of principal and interest payments and the generation of ancillary fees related to the servicing of mortgage loans

in addition  we also experienced an increase in average upb for our private asset backed securitizations portfolio  which increased to billion in the year ended december  compared to billion in the comparable period 
increase of million from fees earned from our reverse mortgage portfolio for which we began servicing in january increase of million due to higher modification fees earned from hamp and non hamp modifications 
increase of million due to higher loss mitigation and performance based incentive fees earned from a gse 

table of contents increase of million from increased collections from late fees and other ancillary charges 
increase of million in other servicing fee income due to our june aurora servicing portfolio acquisition 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we acquired a master servicing portfolio of over billion 
revenues related to the master servicing portfolio are included in other servicing fee income 
decrease of million from change in fair value on msrs which was recognized in servicing fee income 
the fair value of our msrs is based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows related to servicing these loans 
the revenue components of the cash flows are servicing fees  interest earned on custodial accounts  and other ancillary income 
the expense components include operating costs related to servicing the loans including delinquency and foreclosure costs and interest expenses on servicing advances 
the expected future cash flows are primarily impacted by prepayment estimates  delinquencies  and market discount rates 
generally  the value of msrs increases when interest rates increase and decreases when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates 
other factors affecting the msr value includes the estimated effects of loan modifications on expected cash flows 
such modifications tend to positively impact cash flows by extending the expected life of the affected msr and potentially producing additional revenue opportunities depending on the type of modification 
in valuing the msrs  we believe our assumptions are consistent with the assumptions other major market participants use 
these assumptions include a level of future modification activity that we believe major market participants would use in their valuation of msrs 
internally  we have modification goals that exceed the assumptions utilized in our valuation model 
nevertheless  were we to apply an assumption of a level of future modifications consistent with our internal goals to our msr valuation  we do not believe the resulting increase in value would be material 
additionally  several state attorneys general have requested that certain mortgage servicers  including us  suspend foreclosure proceedings pending internal review to ensure compliance with applicable law  and we received requests from four such state attorneys general 
although we have resumed those previously delayed proceedings  changes in the foreclosure process that may be required by government or regulatory bodies could increase the cost of servicing and diminish the value of our msrs 
we utilize assumptions of servicing costs that include delinquency and foreclosure costs that we believe major market participants would use to value their msrs 
we periodically compare our internal msr valuation to third party valuation of our msrs to help substantiate our market assumptions 
we have considered the costs related to the delayed proceedings in our assumptions and we do not believe that any resulting decrease in the msr was material given the expected short term nature of the issue 
increase of million from the net impact of accretion amortization on our mortgage servicing rights related to acquisitions of reverse mortgage portfolios during with no comparable accretion amortization recorded during the twelve months ended december decrease of million from the change in fair value of our excess spread financing arrangements 
in conjunction with various msr acquisitions  we have entered into sale and assignment agreements  which we treated as financings 
within these agreements  we sell the right to receive a portion of the excess cash flow generated from certain underlying msr portfolios after receipt of a fixed basic servicing fee per loan 
we measure these financing arrangements at fair value 
other fee income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or due to higher commissions earned on lender placed insurance and higher reo sales commissions

interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  due in part to interest earned on our participating interests in reverse mortgages combined with accretion recognized related to discounts recorded on acquired servicer advances 
during  in conjunction with an msr acquisition  we allocated a discount to the related servicer advances 
this discount is realized as the underlying servicer advances are collected 
we recognized million of the discount in related to collections on the servicer advances 
we recorded million of contract termination fees for the year ended december  during  we pursued a potential acquisition of the mortgage servicing rights and other assets of a financial services company in bankruptcy and received the right to receive a breakup fee in the event that we did not win the bankruptcy auction for these assets 
we were not the highest bidder in the auction and subsequently received the breakup fee which was recorded in contract termination fees  net of the portion payable to nationstar co investment partner in the potential acquisition 
we did not recognize any contract termination fees in or we recognized a loss on equity investment of million during compared to million in the large increase in the loss relates to the decision to wind down the operation of the underlying entity

b increase of million due to higher modification fees earned from hamp and non hamp modifications 
c decrease of million due to decreased loss mitigation and performance based incentive fees earned from a gse 
d decrease of million from change in fair value on msrs which was recognized in servicing fee income 
the fair value of our msrs is based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows related to servicing these loans 
the revenue components of the cash flows are servicing fees  interest earned on custodial accounts  and other ancillary income 
the expense components include operating costs related to servicing the loans including delinquency and foreclosure costs and interest expenses on servicing advances 
the expected future cash flows are primarily impacted by prepayment estimates  delinquencies  and market discount rates 
generally  the value of msrs increases when interest rates increase and decreases when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates 
other factors affecting the msr value includes the estimated effects of loan modifications on expected cash flows

total other income expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease in expense  net of income  of million  or  primarily due to the net effect of the following 
table of contents interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  due to higher average outstanding custodial cash deposit balances on custodial cash accounts as a result of the growth in our servicing portfolio 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily due to higher average outstanding debt of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period 
the impact of the higher debt balances is partially offset by lower interest rates due to declines in the base libor and decreases in the overall index margin on outstanding servicer advance facilities 
interest expense from the senior notes was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and interest expense also includes gains for the ineffective portion of cash flow hedge of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and loss on interest rate swaps and caps was million for the year ended december  compared to a million gain for the year ended december  effective october   we designated an existing interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge against outstanding floating rate financing associated with one of our outstanding servicer advance facilities 
this interest rate swap is recorded at fair value  with any changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedge being recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income 
prior to this designation  any changes in fair value were recorded as a loss on interest rate swaps and caps on our statement of operations 
in conjunction with our october amendment to our abs advance financing facility  we paid off our abs advance financing facility and transferred the related collateral to the abs advance financing facility

legacy portfolio and other through december  our legacy portfolio and other consisted primarily of non prime and nonconforming residential mortgage loans that we primarily originated from april to july revenues and expenses are primarily a result of mortgage loans transferred to securitization trusts that were structured as secured borrowings  resulting in carrying the securitized loans as mortgage loans on our consolidated balance sheets and recognizing the asset backed certificates as nonrecourse debt 
prior to september  these residential mortgage loans were classified as mortgage loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet and carried at the lower of cost or fair value and financed through a combination of our existing warehouse facilities and our corporate note 
these loans were transferred on october   from mortgage loans held for sale to a held for investment classification at fair value on the transfer date 
subsequent to the transfer date  we completed the securitization of the mortgage loans  which was structured as a secured borrowing 
this structure resulted in carrying the securitized loans as mortgages on our consolidated balance sheet and recognizing the asset backed certificates acquired by third parties as nonrecourse debt 
effective january   accounting guidance eliminated the concept of a qspe 
consequently  all existing securitization trusts are considered vies and are now subject to the new consolidation guidance 
upon consolidation of certain of these vies  we recognized the securitized mortgage loans related to these securitization trusts as mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt 
see note variable interest entities and securitizations to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we elected the fair value option provided for by asc  financial instruments overall 
assets and liabilities related to these vies are included in legacy assets and other in our segmented results 
in december  we sold our remaining variable interest in a securitization trust that had been a consolidated vie since january  and deconsolidated the variable interest 
upon deconsolidation of this vie  we derecognized the related mortgage loans held for investment  subject to abs nonrecourse debt and the abs nonrecourse debt

the increases are generally the result of our acquisitions of msr portfolios  including aurora  the increase in our mortgage origination business and our entry into servicing reverse mortgages 
included in our payables and accrued liabilities caption on our balance sheet is our reserve for repurchases and indemnifications of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this liability represents our i estimate of losses to be incurred on the repurchase of certain loans that we previously sold and ii estimate of losses to be incurred for indemnification of losses incurred by purchasers or insurers with respect to loans that we sold 
certain sale contracts include provisions requiring us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make certain initial loan payments due to the acquirer or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties 
these representations and warranties are made to the loan purchasers or insurers about various characteristics of the loans  such as the manner of origination  the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided and typically are in place for the life of the loan 
although the representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan  we believe that most repurchase requests occur within the first five years of the loan 
in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties  we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan 
in addition  an investor may request that we refund a portion of the premium paid on the sale of mortgage loans if a loan is prepaid within a certain amount of time from the date of sale 
we record a provision for estimated repurchases  loss indemnification and premium recapture on loans sold  which is charged to gain on mortgage loans held for sale 
the activity of our outstanding repurchase reserves were as follows for the periods indicated dollars in thousands 
year ended december  repurchase reserves  beginning of period additions charge offs repurchase reserves  end of period the following table summarizes the changes in upb and loan count related to unresolved repurchase and indemnification requests for the periods indicated dollars in millions year ended december  upb count upb count upb count beginning balance repurchases and indemnifications claims initiated rescinded ending balance 
table of contents the following five year table details our loan sales by period dollars in billions year ended december  total count count count count count count loan sales we increase the reserve by applying an estimated loss factor to the principal balance of loan sales 
secondarily  the reserve may be increased based on outstanding claims received 
we have observed an increase in repurchase requests in the last several years 
we believe that because of the increase in our loan originations since  repurchase requests are likely to increase 
should home values decrease  our realized loan losses from loan repurchases and indemnifications may increase as well 
as such  our reserve for repurchases may increase beyond our current expectations 
while the ultimate amount of repurchases and premium recapture is an estimate  we consider the liability to be adequate at each balance sheet date 
at december   outstanding equity was million  a million increase from december   which is primarily attributable to net income of million in the period  million in ipo proceeds  contributions of million from fif  and million in share based compensation 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting developments see note significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements in
