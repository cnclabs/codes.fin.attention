table of contents part i item business overview cbeyond is a managed information technology or it and communications services provider 
our mission is to be the technology ally for small and mid sized businesses so our customers can focus on their business  not their technology 
we pursue this mission by packaging big business technologies and services for small and mid sized businesses in a convenient and affordable bundle that they generally could not obtain from any other single supplier 
this strategy is based on the belief that small and mid sized businesses highly value the capabilities and productivity such technologies and services enable  but do not typically have the resources  expertise  or time to purchase and manage them  particularly for the smaller scale of operations typical of our target customers 
we first launched our service offerings in atlanta in april and have since expanded our on net network and service offerings into additional metropolitan markets 
our off net network  which is managed by third party network providers  extends the reach of our services across the majority of the united states 
our products and bundles have evolved over time as new technologies have emerged  which is described in greater detail in item herein 
we provide services to businesses primarily consisting of between and employees in the united states 
all of such services  other than certain cloud based services purchased outside of an integrated bundle  are delivered over our secure all internet protocol or ip network 
our secure network  which allows us to control quality of service much better than services delivered over the public internet  achieves reliability comparable to that of traditional communications networks 
we utilize various types of high speed connections where available and economically feasible  such as copper based and optical fiber networks collectively referred to as metro ethernet 
cbeyond provides a high value customer service experience tailored and devoted solely to serving small and mid sized enterprises 
our network management and monitoring systems scan more than  network elements making millions of measurements each day 
our systems can detect anomalies and facilitate corrective action  often prior to customer detection 
we give customers multiple paths to interact with us  including on site sales and support  telephone  chat  fax  e mail  and on line portals 
our redundant call centers in denver  co and atlanta  ga are staffed continuously hours a day 
our data center in louisville  ky  which is our primary data center for supporting our cloud based services  is also staffed hours a day 
offerings we market our service offerings under four product families totalnetwork  totalvoice  totalcloud  and totalassist 
we combine these service offerings into a wide range of bundles to satisfy the unique needs of our customers 
these bundles range from a basic offering of local and long distance voice communications services with broadband internet access to a comprehensive offering of discrete it  network  communications  mobile services  security  and professional services 
businesses that utilize both our network and data center offerings experience a higher level of performance  security  survivability  and risk management 
this also often results in increased reliability  especially for remote users  and lower total cost of ownership 
we are responsible for all aspects of their outsourced it implementation 
totalnetwork principally includes our metro ethernet broadband internet access  t internet access  multi protocol label switching or mpls and virtual private networking or vpn services  as well as our expanding security portfolio that includes virus protection  internet network border security services  firewalls  and remote secure vpn services 
our networking catalog also includes e commerce capabilities and site to site enterprise grade internetworking 
internet access services provide symmetrical capacity ranging from megabits per second or mbps through mbps 
these non shared access networks with high performance peering are suitable for critical business applications such as video conferencing  websites  and e commerce 
for site to site enterprise networking  we offer metro ethernet and mpls networking to any address in the united states 
this managed service includes premise equipment and router for a competitive monthly price 
it also features customer configurable class of service so businesses can transport all voice and data over one unified network  a key driver for adoption of this service 
totalvoice consists of our local  long distance  and mobile phone services 
totalcloud includes our flagship cloud offerings totalcloud data center and totalcloud phone system  hosted microsoft exchange  microsoft asp 
net web hosting  and other managed hosting products such as microsoft sql  on line back up  and fax to email 
our totalcloud data center infrastructure as a service or iaas offering includes virtual and physical servers with microsoft hyper v hypervisor management engine and console 
our totalcloud phone system service includes our cloud server based private branch exchange or pbx 

table of contents totalassist contains a variety of professional services  including both one time engagements and recurring monthly services 
one time engagements include services such as our smart start installation and training services as well as migration services for transitioning essential applications and data from customers on premise servers to our data center 
we believe these migration services are a key differentiator and positively influence the adoption and implementation of our cloud based solutions 
operations cbeyond offers a differentiated value proposition to its customers through superior pre and post sale customer service 
we believe three factors are keys to this superiority our focus on small and mid sized businesses leads to process and procedural advantages not achievable by operators serving multiple market segments  proprietary systems that facilitate rapid service creation  and a culture of service reinforced by a significant internal focus on customer satisfaction scores 
we continue to put emphasis on customer service as a key cultural differentiator to drive satisfaction and referrals 
we define the overall customer experience across all customer touch points and the implementation of a cohesive program to ensure higher retention rates 
this focus has also contributed to continued improvements in our automated care and support capabilities 
sales and marketing direct sales in our local network markets  our primary marketing mechanism is a direct sales force that presents communications bundles sold at fixed prices 
this is an acquisition centric  high activity model 
this approach enables us to intercept or create sales opportunities with little to no mass marketing outreach 
this strategy has proved successful in achieving penetration rates as high as one in five target businesses 
a more formal  consultative sales and marketing approach is used to address particularly high value prospects 
we engage these prospects with a more knowledgeable sales and technical support channel using formal funnel management and specific sales team assignments 
during  we began an initiative to realign our resources by reducing staffing levels in our traditional communications centric sales force while expanding new distribution channels focused on technology dependent customers 
indirect sales we supplement our direct sales force with partners who leverage preexisting business relationships and act as sales agents 
these agents include value added resellers  local area network consultants and other it and communications consultants 
private label resellers private label resellers or plrs use their brand and resources to market  sell  invoice  and provide support for their customers 
plrs include value added resellers  managed services providers  systems integrators  and software vendors 
we support plrs in a wide range of activities that includes providing cloud infrastructure and services  on line web portals for end user and plr account administration  technical support  and overall program management 
we invoice plrs at a discount to our retail pricing for the services consumed by their end user customers 
marketing our marketing resources focus on supporting the consultative sales force 
the goal is to create a viable presence and establish brand credibility 
this includes advertising  vertical campaigns  collateral  digital marketing  incentives  events  press relations  analyst engagement  promotions  and events 
customers prior to joining cbeyond  the majority of our customers received basic communications services from the incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs and frequently had multiple other providers for other it and communications services 
often they simply did not utilize the kinds of it services available through our service packages 
in most cases  these businesses did not receive the focus and personalized attention that larger enterprises enjoy and often lagged behind larger businesses in the adoption of productivity enhancing and cost effective it and communications services 

table of contents our focus on small and mid sized businesses means no single customer or group of customers represents a significant percentage of our customer base or revenues 
our largest customer segments are professional services  which include physicians  legal offices  insurance services  consulting firms  accounting firms and real estate services 
each of these segments represents less than of our customer base 
markets we first launched our service offerings in atlanta in april and have since expanded our on net network and service offerings into additional metropolitan markets within the united states 
we offer mpls to any address in the united states and offer cloud based services to any address globally 
as of december  we provide cloud based services to customers located in more than countries 
during  less than of our total revenue came from customers based outside of the united states 
network our network infrastructure utilizes a mixture of access and transport technologies that delivers high speed  secure  and scalable network services 
we have created our on net network through a combination of owned and leased optical fiber and copper based ethernet assets 
our local  regional  and national networks are highly integrated providing an enhanced security and control of the quality of service delivered to our customers 
today  our on net network serves metropolitan markets and our off net network  which is managed by third party network providers  extends our network reach and access across the majority of the united states 
this allows geographically dispersed  multi location companies to interconnect their locations across one unified network providing an end to end managed network 
we deliver our voice services by digitizing voice communications into ip packets and converging them with data services for transport across our network 
compared to traditional networks using legacy technologies  our network design requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs 
the integration of our network with an automated front and back office system allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision  and offer an on line self service portal  thereby reducing expenses while increasing satisfaction 
metro ethernet we are increasing our capabilities to serve a significant number of our customers with metro ethernet by we substantially completed the copper based metro ethernet customer conversion project in and have shifted focus to our optical fiber access initiative 
during the first quarter of we executed agreements to provide optical fiber access in multiple markets through long term capital leases of fiber infrastructure assets  including agreements for the indefeasible rights of use or iru of certain fiber network assets 
these agreements are with a variety of fiber network providers and generally have terms of years  with renewal options 
we expect to incur costs of between million and million through associated with the initial phase of this initiative 
today  in the metropolitan markets served by our on net network  our metro ethernet network encompasses the capability to reach more than  multi tenant office buildings  over cbeyond fiber lit multi tenant office buildings  over  rd party fiber lit multi tenant office buildings  over  miles of intra city fiber route miles  copper based ethernet availability in all markets 
in  we will continue to proactively invest in converting our legacy t based network access to metro ethernet access 
upfront costs associated with our metro ethernet initiative are expected to be offset by significant access cost savings and competitive advantages over time 
competition we broadly compete with companies that could provide both voice and enhanced services to small and mid sized businesses in our markets 
our voice service offerings primarily compete with the ilecs centurylink in denver  minneapolis  and seattle  at t in atlanta  dallas  detroit  houston  chicago  los angeles  san diego  miami  and the san francisco bay area  verizon in dallas  los angeles  the greater washington dc area  and boston  and frontier in seattle 
based on information provided by 
table of contents our customers at the time of activation  approximately of our customers used an ilec for local telephone service prior to signing with us 
we also compete in the provisioning of voice services with various cable television companies and competitive local exchange carriers or clecs in each of our markets 
competing cable television companies include cox communications  comcast  time warner cable and cablevision 
competing clecs include xo communications  windstream  integra telecom  telepacific communications and earthlink  among many others 
certain clecs have adopted voip technology similar to that employed by us  and we expect others to do so in the future 
in addition  there are other providers using voip technology  such as vonage and skype a division of microsoft  which offer service using the public internet to access their customers 
we do not currently view these companies as our direct competitors because they primarily serve the consumer market and businesses with fewer than four lines 
we expect other companies may be formed in the future to take advantage of a voip based business model 
existing companies may also expand their focus in the future to target small and mid sized business customers 
although we seldom provide bandwidth on a stand alone basis  we face competition from broadband providers that facilitate access to internet based voip services and other cloud based services 
these competitors include the ilecs and certain cable television companies  as well as optical fiber based bandwidth providers such as zayo and sidera 
in connection with our mobile service offerings  we compete with national wireless phone companies  such as at t  sprint  t mobile usa  and verizon wireless  as well as other regional wireless providers 
in connection with our cloud based service offerings  we compete with several cloud server and cloud pbx service providers 
with respect to cloud server and other hosting services  we compete with companies such as rackspace  google  ibm  hewlett packard  internap  hosting 
com  microsoft  godaddy 
com  and amazon web services 
in the cloud pbx space we compete with providers such as x  telesphere  bandwidth 
com  broadvox  simplesignal  and vocalocity 
government regulation as a company that sells telecommunications services  our business is  in part  subject to the statutory framework established by federal legislation in the telecommunications act of or telecom act  various state statues and varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
in contrast to certain other ip based carriers  we have elected to operate as a common carrier  rather than representing that we should face diminished regulation based on our use of ip technology 
as a common carrier  we are subject to the jurisdiction of both federal and state regulatory agencies that have the authority to review our prices  terms and conditions of service 
these regulatory agencies exercise minimal control over our prices and services  but do impose various obligations such as reporting  payment of fees and compliance with consumer protection and public safety requirements 
further  we are also subject to requirements placed on interconnected voip providers in addition to the requirements we are subject to as a common carrier 
we operate as a facilities based carrier and have received all necessary state and federal authorizations to do so 
unlike resale carriers  we do not rely upon access to the switching facilities of ilecs such as at t or verizon 
as a facilities based carrier  we have undertaken a variety of regulatory obligations  including providing access to emergency systems  permitting law enforcement officials access to our network upon proper authorization  contributing to the cost of the fcc and  where applicable  state universal service programs and making our services accessible to persons with disabilities 
by operating as a common carrier  we also benefit from certain legal rights established by federal legislation  especially the telecom act  which gives us and other common carrier competitive entrants the right to interconnect to the ilecs networks and to access elements of their networks on an unbundled basis 
these rights are not available to providers who do not operate as common carriers 
we have used these rights to gain interconnections with ilecs in each metropolitan market where we provide service and to purchase selected unbundled network elements or unes at prices based on incremental cost  that provide us with dependable  high quality digital access to our customers premises which we use to provide them with a bundle of management software services 
the united states congress  or congress  the fcc  and state regulators are considering a variety of issues that may result in changes in the statutory and regulatory environment in which we operate our business 
while federal legislation that could affect our business operations or costs is always a possibility  we believe it is unlikely that any such negative legislation will be passed by congress in we also believe the fcc is unlikely to adopt rules that extinguish our basic right or ability to compete in the telecommunications markets and that any rule changes that affect us will likely be accompanied by transition periods sufficient to allow us to adjust our business practices accordingly 
some of the changes under consideration by congress  the fcc  and state regulators could affect our competitors differently than they affect us 

table of contents regulatory framework although we have begun providing service to our customers using ethernet technology over copper loops without heavy reliance on ilec provided electronics and  to a lesser extent  optical fiber network connections that are not at all dependent on unes  our business continues to rely heavily on the use of t une loops and enhanced extended links that include t loop components for access to customer premises 
our existing strategy is based on fcc rules that require ilecs to provide us unes at wholesale prices based on incremental costs in all wire centers except those with the densest concentration of loops serving business customers 
this exception affects the price we pay to obtain access to t loops in some of the central business districts we serve 
these rules that currently govern our access to both t and copper loop unes may change due to future fcc decisions or acts of congress  and we are unable to predict how such future developments may affect our business 
we are  however  taking steps to minimize our reliance on ilec facilities both to limit our exposure should current regulations change and to provide higher bandwidth services to our customers 
the telecom act the telecom act  which substantially revised the communications act of  established the regulatory preconditions to allow companies like us to compete for the provision of local communications services 
we have developed our business  including our decision to operate as a common carrier  and designed and constructed our networks to take advantage of the features of the telecom act that require cooperation from the ilecs 
there have been numerous attempts to revise or eliminate the basic framework for competition in the local exchange services market through a combination of federal legislation  new fcc rules and challenges to existing and proposed regulations by the ilecs 
we anticipate that congress will consider a range of proposals to modify the telecom act over the next few years  including some proposals that could restrict or eliminate our access to elements of the ilecs networks 
however  we consider it unlikely that congress would reverse the fundamental policy of encouraging competition in communications markets 
congress may also consider legislation that would address the impact of the internet on the telecom act 
such legislation could seek to clarify the regulations applicable to voip and internet access service providers 
we believe that such legislation is unlikely to result in the imposition of new regulatory obligations on us  although it is possible that it will eliminate certain regulatory obligations that apply to us because of our status as a common carrier 
federal regulation the fcc regulates interstate and international communications services in the united states  including access to local communications networks for the origination and termination of these services 
we provide interstate and international services on a common carrier basis 
the fcc has authorized the provision of domestic interstate communications services by rule but requires all common carriers to obtain an authorization to construct and operate international communications facilities and to provide or resell communications services between the united states and international points 
we have secured authority from the fcc for the installation  acquisition and operation of our wireline network facilities to provide facilities based international services 
unlike ilecs  our retail services are not currently subject to price cap or rate of return regulation 
we are therefore free to set our own prices for end user services subject only to the general federal guidelines that our charges for interstate and international services be just  reasonable and non discriminatory 
we have filed tariffs with the fcc containing interstate rates we charge to long distance carriers for access to our network  also called interstate access charges 
the rates we can charge for interstate access  unlike our end user services  are limited by fcc rules 
we are also required to file periodic reports  to pay regulatory fees based on our interstate revenues and to comply with fcc regulations concerning the content and format of our bills  the process for changing a customer subscribed carrier and other consumer protection matters 
the fcc has the authority to impose monetary forfeitures and to condition or revoke a carrier operating authority for violations of these requirements 
our operating costs are increased by the need to assure compliance with these regulatory obligations 
as a key part of its regulatory mandate  and in response to petitions filed by ilecs and others  the fcc constantly reviews the regulations it administers 
these proceedings could eventually have some impact on our ability to buy unes in one or more markets we serve or wish to serve  the prices we pay for unes  the prices we pay for special access facilities  inter carrier compensation rates  interconnection rules  universal service fund or usf rates and other rules and regulations that impact our business 
we monitor these proceedings closely and are active participants in those that could have the most impact on us  whether positive or negative 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or new proceedings that may be initiated 
the fcc has made significant changes to the federal usf and inter carrier compensation regimes and is considering making additional reforms 
these changes may affect the fees we are required to pay to the usf  but since we and our competitors generally pass these fees through to customers  we expect any changes to have minimal competitive effect 
similarly  although the fcc recently ordered significant reductions in the default rates for terminating interstate and intrastate telecommunications traffic  we do not expect these changes in inter carrier compensation rules to have a material effect on us 
table of contents because we derive the vast majority of our revenues directly from our customers rather than from other carriers 
reciprocal compensation for termination of local calls is not a significant source of revenue  and we derive relatively little revenue from access charges for origination and termination of long distance calls over our network 
nevertheless  the inter carrier compensation regime is in a state of transition to implement the long term reforms adopted by the fcc  and it is impossible to foresee all potential outcomes  whether temporary or permanent  either of the transition or ultimate state of the inter carrier compensation system 
for example  it is possible  and we cannot predict  whether local telephone companies that rely more heavily on inter carrier compensation revenues may seek to recoup lost access revenue by raising transit service rates or other rates associated with the switching and transport of telecommunications traffic 
we expect that any changes to the fcc rules governing our right to lease loops from the ilecs will continue to provide us with the ability to provision services to current and new customer locations  although not necessarily at current prices 
all ilecs are required  independent of the une rules  to offer us some form of t loop and transport services as well as copper loops without associated electronics 
it is possible that the fcc could eliminate these requirements at some time in the future  but we expect that any such elimination would be accompanied by new rules and regulations that would provide us with at least equivalent access to current and new customer locations although not necessarily via the same technology or at the same prices 
whatever actions the fcc or congress may take  we may be able to negotiate reasonable prices for bandwidth services through commercial negotiations with ilecs  but we cannot provide assurance that these possibilities will occur 
if all other options were unavailable  we would be required to pay special access rates for these services or comparable services 
these rates are substantially higher than the rates we pay for unes 
state regulation state agencies exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services  including local telephone service and in state toll calls 
to date  we are authorized to provide intrastate local telephone  long distance telephone and operator services in california  colorado  florida  georgia  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  texas  virginia  washington  and the district of columbia  as well as in other states where we are not yet operational 
as a condition to providing intrastate telecommunications services  we are required  among other things  to file and maintain intrastate tariffs or price lists describing the rates  terms and conditions of our services  comply with state regulatory reporting  tax and fee obligations  including contributions to intrastate universal service funds  and comply with  and to submit to  state regulatory jurisdiction over consumer protection policies including regulations governing customer privacy  changing of service providers and content of customer bills  complaints  transfers of control and certain financing transactions 
generally  state regulatory authorities can condition  modify  cancel  terminate or revoke certificates of authority to operate in a state for failure to comply with state laws or the rules  regulations and policies of the state regulatory authority 
fines and other penalties may also be imposed for such violations 
as we expand our operations  we identify and evaluate the requirements specific to each individual state to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of that state 
in addition  states are required under the telecom act to approve agreements for the interconnection of telecommunications carriers facilities with those of the ilec  to arbitrate disputes arising in negotiations for interconnection and to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements 
in exercising this authority  the states may ultimately determine the rates  terms and conditions under which we can obtain access to the loop and transport unes that are required to be available under the fcc rules 
the states may re examine these rates  terms and conditions from time to time 
state governments and their regulatory authorities may also assert jurisdiction over the provision of intrastate ip communications services where they believe that their authority is broad enough to cover regulation of ip based services 
various state regulatory authorities have initiated proceedings to examine the regulatory status of ip based services  and some have chosen to regulate such services 
unlike some other ip based providers  we already operate as a regulated carrier subject to state regulation  rules and fees and  therefore  we do not expect that our business will be materially affected by these proceedings 
the fcc ongoing proceedings on voip are expected to address  among other issues  the appropriate role of state governments in the regulation of these services 
local regulation in certain locations  we are required to obtain local franchises  licenses or other operating rights and street opening and construction permits to install  expand and operate our telecommunications facilities along the public rights of way 
in some of the areas where we provide services  we pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of gross revenues 
cities that do not currently impose fees might seek to impose them in the future  and after the expiration of existing franchises  fees could increase 
under the telecom act  state and local governments retain the right to manage the public rights of way and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers  on a competitively neutral and non discriminatory basis  
table of contents to recover the costs associated with government management of the public rights of way 
these activities must be consistent with the telecom act and may not have the effect of prohibiting us from providing telecommunications services in any particular local jurisdiction 
in certain circumstances  we may be subject to local fees associated with construction and operation of telecommunications facilities along the public rights of way 
to the extent these fees are required  we comply with applicable requirements to collect and remit the fees

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our growth and financial health are subject to a number of economic risks 
financial markets periodically experience significant disruptions  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
during these disruptions  our ability to access capital and credit markets may be limited at a time when we would like  or need  to do so 
this could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and possibly impair our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations 
we attempt to monitor the financial health of significant vendors because economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of third party vendors important to our operations to continue as going concerns 
if such vendors were to fail  we may not be able to replace them without disruptions to  or deterioration of  our service and we may incur higher costs associated with the new vendors 
transitioning to new vendors may also result in the loss of the value of assets associated with our integration of third party services into our network or service offering 
the depth and duration of economic downturns on the small and mid sized business sector may also reduce the size and viability of our target market of small and mid sized businesses  particularly in geographic areas where the economic impacts are more severe 
we are unable to predict the timing  likely duration or severity of economic downturns on the small business sector  which may in turn limit the formation of small business customers 
the success of our growth and expansion plans depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control 
we have thus far grown our business by increasing the number of customers in existing markets  entering new geographical markets  and selling additional services to existing customers 
we do not plan to open additional geographic markets in the near term and we expect future revenue growth will come by selling more complex and profitable services  including cloud based services  to new and existing customers over a mix of access circuit types including une ts  ethernet services provided over une copper loops  fiber services provided via long term leases  and other fiber connections through short term operating leases 
there is no guarantee we will be able to grow in the future 
our success in achieving growth depends upon several factors including the availability and retention of qualified and effective personnel with the expertise required to sell and operate effectively or successfully  the overall economic health of existing markets or small businesses in general  the number and effectiveness of competitors  the pricing structure under which we will be able to obtain circuits and purchase other services required to serve our customers  the availability to us of technologies needed to remain competitive  our ability to establish relationships and work effectively with the local telephone companies and other network infrastructure providers  building owners and managers  and installation and maintenance service providers for the provision and maintenance of access lines to customers  and federal and state regulatory conditions  including rules that burden our business and therefore increase our costs  and regulatory requirements imposed on incumbent providers from which we derive significant benefits 
we are dependent upon third parties to obtain higher bandwidth capacity through negotiated commercial arrangements with fiber  cable and telecommunications companies and building owners and managers 
our ability to enter new agreements or expand or renew existing agreements cannot be assured 
pursuing our strategy of focusing on sophisticated customers with complex needs requires us to be able to provide higher bandwidth capacity than our traditional t based access type 
we are dependent upon third parties to obtain this higher bandwidth capacity through negotiated commercial arrangements  rather than under a regulatory framework  with fiber  cable and telecommunications companies  which may be competitors  and building owners and managers 
our ability to enter new agreements or renew existing agreements  whether at economically attractive rates or at all  cannot be assured 

table of contents our data center operations are concentrated in a few facilities 
disruptions at one or more of these locations could significantly diminish our ability to serve customers  which could reduce our revenue and harm our reputation and financial results 
our services do not require geographic proximity of our data centers to our customers  so such facilities are concentrated at a few locations 
these data centers are subject to various points of failure 
equipment problems  whether or not within our control  could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage 
accordingly  downtime in one of our data centers could affect a significant proportion of our customers  which could reduce our revenue  harm our reputation and have adverse financial impacts to our business 
acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business 
we may continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy  that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment  or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees  business systems  and technology  or diversion of management attention from our other businesses 
these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 
the fixed pricing structure for our integrated packages makes us vulnerable to price increases by our suppliers for network equipment and access fees for circuits that we lease to gain access to our customers 
we offer a majority of our customers an integrated package at a fixed price for one  two or three years 
if we experience an increase in our costs due to price increases from our suppliers  vendors or third party carriers  new or changed regulation  or increases in access fees  installation fees  interconnection fees payable to local telephone companies or other fees  we may not be able to pass these increases on to our customers immediately  and this could materially harm our results of operations 
we face intense competition from other service providers that have significantly greater resources than we do 
several of these competitors are better positioned to engage in competitive pricing  which may impede our ability to implement our business model of attracting customers away from such providers 
the market we compete in is highly competitive 
we compete  and expect to continue to compete  with many types of service providers  including traditional local telephone companies and cable companies 
we also face competition from mobile service providers and large  well established cloud service providers 
in the future  we may also face increased competition from new voip based service providers or other managed service providers 
our current or future competitors may provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us  or at lower prices  or adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
a substantial majority of our target customers are existing small and mid sized businesses that are already purchasing services from one or more of these providers 
the success of our operations is in part dependent on our ability to persuade these small businesses to leave their current providers 
many of these providers have competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  better access to capital  more extensive high speed bandwidth capabilities  brand name recognition and long standing relationships with customers 
these resources may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
because of their greater financial resources  some of our competitors can also better afford to reduce prices for their services and engage in aggressive promotional activities 
such tactics could have a negative impact on our business 
for example  some of our competitors have adopted pricing plans that are similar to and in some cases lower than the rates that we charge for similar services 
in addition  other providers are offering unlimited or nearly unlimited use of some of their services for an attractive monthly rate 
any of the foregoing factors could cause us to lose customers or further reduce our prices to remain competitive  resulting in continued decreases in average monthly revenue per customer location 
improvements in quality of service of voip technology provided over the public internet could increase competition 
we believe we generally do not compete with voip providers who use the public internet to transmit communications traffic  as these providers generally do not provide the level and quality of service typically demanded by the business customers we serve 
however  future advances in voip technology may enable these providers to offer an improved level and quality of service over the public internet to business customers and with lower costs than using a private network 
this development could result in increased price competition and may affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents continued industry consolidation could further strengthen our competitors  and we could lose customers or face adverse changes in regulation 
in the past several years  the communication industry has undergone a significant amount of consolidation 
for example verizon merged with mci  sbc merged with at t  at t and bellsouth merged  comcast acquired a clec based in the midwest and a nationwide wholesale provider of hosted voip services  windstream acquired nuvox  a privately held clec and competitor  and centurylink acquired qwest 
the increased size and market power of these companies may have adverse consequences for us  and other large mergers may create larger and more efficient competitors 
these competitors could focus their large resources on regaining share in the small and mid sized business sector  and we could lose customers or not grow 
furthermore  these companies could use their greater resources to lobby effectively for changes in federal or state regulation that could have an adverse effect on our cost structure or our right to use access circuits that they are currently required to make available to us 
these changes could have a harmful effect on our future financial results 
we are susceptible to business and political risks from our use of international third party resources that could result in delays in the development or maintenance of operational support systems and business processes 
a portion of our it development is performed by third parties with offshore resources 
there are inherent risks in engaging offshore resources including difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in political or economic conditions and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we do not manage our international third party vendors successfully  our business could be adversely affected 
our operational support systems and business processes may not be adequate to effectively manage our growth 
our continued success depends on the scalability of our systems and processes 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes are adequate to support ongoing growth in customers 
in addition  our growing managed services profile  including our cloud services and associated new applications  may create operating inefficiencies and result in service problems if we are unsuccessful in fully integrating such newer services into our existing operations 
failure to effectively manage future growth in customers or product complexity could harm our quality of service and customer relationships  which could increase our customer churn  result in higher operating costs  write offs or other accounting charges and otherwise materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third parties  including local telephone companies  fiber network operators and cable companies  for the installation and maintenance of a significant portion of our network elements and facilities  including access circuits to our customers 
a significant majority of our network elements and facilities  including customers access circuits  are installed and maintained by third parties  primarily local telephone companies  but increasingly fiber network operators and cable companies due to our focus on higher bandwidth offerings 
if these third parties do not perform installations  maintenance or repairs properly or in a timely manner  our customers could experience disruption in service and delays in obtaining our services 
since inception  we have experienced routine delays in the installation of t lines by the local telephone companies to our customers in each of our markets  although these delays have not yet resulted in any material impact to our ability to compete and add customers in our markets 
any delays or work stoppage action by employees of local telephone companies on which we rely to provide services to us could result in substantial delays in activating new customers lines and could materially harm our operations 
although local telephone companies may be required to pay fines and penalties to us for failures to provide us with these installation and maintenance services according to prescribed time intervals  the negative impact on our business of such failures could substantially exceed the amount of any such cash payments 
furthermore  we are also dependent on traditional local telephone companies for access to their collocation facilities  and we utilize certain of their network elements 
these companies are required to provide access to unes and collocations under federal law  but it is possible that they could refuse to comply with their obligations or engage in delay tactics that could negatively affect our ability to compete 
in addition  failure of these elements or damage to a local telephone company collocation facility could cause disruptions in our service 
we depend on third party providers who install and maintain our equipment at customer locations 
we must maintain relationships with efficient service providers in our current cities and identify similar providers as we enter new markets in order to maintain quality in our operations 
the installation and maintenance of our equipment at customer locations is an essential step that enables our customers to use our service 
we outsource these services to a number of different vendors in each market 
we must ensure that these vendors adhere to the timelines and quality that we require to provide our customers with a positive experience 
in addition  we must obtain these services at reasonable prices 
if we are unable to continue maintaining a sufficient number of vendors in our markets who provide high quality service at reasonable prices to us  we may have to use our own employees to perform these 
table of contents services 
we may not be able to manage such services effectively using our own employees with the quality we desire and at reasonable costs 
some of our services are dependent on facilities and systems maintained by or equipment manufactured by third parties over which we have no control  the failure of which could cause interruptions or discontinuation of some of our services  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers or limit our growth 
we provide some of our existing services  such as secure desktop  by reselling to our customers services provided by third parties 
we also offer mobile options integrated with our existing services by reselling mobile services provided by an established national third party mobile carrier and reselling mobile equipment manufactured by third parties 
we do not have control over the networks and other systems maintained by these third parties or their equipment manufacturing processes  facilities or supply chains 
if our third party providers fail to maintain their facilities properly or fail to respond quickly to network or other problems  our customers may experience interruptions in the service they obtain from us or we may not be able to supply the needed mobile equipment 
any service interruptions experienced by our customers could negatively impact our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our ability to attract new customers 
our credit facility imposes restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility  and breach of those covenants may cause us to be in default under those agreements 
the credit agreement limits  and in some circumstances prohibits  our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  investments or other restricted payments  guarantee debts  create liens  sell assets  repurchase our common stock  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
in addition  the credit agreement also requires us to achieve certain financial results 
complying with these covenants may impact our ability to obtain future financing  make acquisitions or capital expenditures at a time when we may need to do so 
such limitations could reduce our ability to grow  and possibly maintain operations  in the future  particularly in prolonged economic contractions 
they may also prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities that may arise 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or maintain required financial results  outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to repay those amounts  our lender could initiate a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding or foreclose on the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
some of the services we provide are regulated by the fcc  state public service commissions and local regulating governmental bodies 
changes in regulation could increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulation by telecommunications authorities at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in regulatory policy could increase the fees we must pay to third parties  make certain required inputs for our network less readily available to us or subject us to requirements that could increase our operating costs 
the t and voice grade copper loop connections we provide to our customers are leased primarily from our competitors  the local telephone companies 
the rules of the fcc  adopted under the telecom act  generally entitle us to lease these connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
it is possible  though we believe unlikely  that congress will pass legislation in the future that will diminish or eliminate our right to lease such connections at regulated rates 
our rights of access to the facilities of local telephone companies may also change as a result of future regulatory decisions  including forbearance petitions by ilecs that currently provide us with access to collocations and unes  as well as court decisions 
to date  no forbearance petitions have been granted that have had any impact on our operations and none are pending 
this could change  however  and there is the possibility that future forbearance grants or other regulatory rulings could limit our various rights under the telecom act 

table of contents although we expect that we will continue to be able to obtain t and other copper loop connections for our customers  we may not be able to do so at current prices 
state regulatory commissions periodically review and establish pricing for the majority of the t and other copper loop connections we use 
state commission decisions are subject to appeal 
if our right to obtain these connections at regulated prices based on incremental costs is further impaired  we will need to either negotiate new commercial arrangements with the local telephone companies to obtain the connections  perhaps at unfavorable rates and conditions  or obtain other means of providing connections to our customers  which may be expensive and require a long timeframe to implement 
these actions may cause us to exit affected markets and decrease our customer base and revenues 
the fcc is also considering changing its rules for calculating incremental cost based rates  which could result in either increases or decreases in our cost to lease these facilities 
significant increases in wholesale prices  especially for the loop element we use most extensively  could materially harm our business 
under the fcc rules  we are required to contribute a percentage of revenue generated from interstate and international telecommunications services and voip services to the federal usf 
current fcc rules permit us to pass this contribution amount on to our customers 
the fcc has adopted a number of reforms to its usf mechanisms and currently is considering others 
it is possible that the reforms adopted could increase our overall contribution obligations for example  by expanding the scope of the regulatory regime to cover broadband internet access services and or limiting our ability to pass these costs through to our customers 
to the extent the fcc adopts new contribution requirements  expands the base of services subject to contribution requirements or otherwise imposes additional contribution obligations  such requirements and obligations may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations 
we also must comply with the communications assistance for law enforcement act of or calea which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment  facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance 
we believe that we have deployed a calea compliant solution throughout our network 
however  we could be subject to an enforcement action by the fcc or law enforcement agencies for any delays related to meeting  or if we fail to comply with  any obligations under calea  or similarly mandated law enforcement related obligations 
such enforcement actions could subject us to fines  cease and desist orders  or other penalties  all of which could adversely affect our business 
further  to the extent the fcc adopts additional capability requirements applicable to voice and data service providers  its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations 
we are required to bill taxes  fees  and other amounts to our customers on behalf of government entities 
determining the services on which such amounts should be assessed and how to calculate the proper amounts can be complex and may involve judgment that an assessing entity may disagree with  exposing us to the possibility of material liabilities for amounts we did not bill to our customers  including interest and penalties 
we are required to bill taxes  fees and other amounts collectively referred to as taxes on behalf of government entities on some of the services we provide to our customers 
these entities include governments and governmental authorities at the county  city  state and federal level or taxing authorities 
each taxing authority may have one or more taxes with unique rules as to which services are subject to each tax and how those services should be taxed 
while some types of taxes may be similar among taxing authorities  the rules and applicable rates are often unique and change from time to time 
determining which taxing authorities have jurisdiction for a customer  which taxes are applicable  and how the specific rules should be applied often involves exercising judgment and making estimations 
the nature of this process creates a risk of non compliance  such as subjecting a customer to the wrong taxing authorities 
other risks that represent higher exposure to us include interpreting rules in a manner that may differ from the taxing authority  resulting in one or more of the following outcomes we may not charge for a tax that we may be liable for  we may charge for a tax at a rate that is lower than what we may be liable for  or we may apply the correct rate using a methodology that differs from the applicable taxing authority methodology 
because we sell many of our services on a bundled basis and assess different taxes on the individual components included within the bundle  there is also a risk that a taxing authority could disagree with the taxable value of a component 
taxing authorities can perform audits for any period or periods still open for review under the applicable statute 
these statutes typically provide that periods remain open for three to four years 
if we were found to be improperly assessing taxes and were assessed for multiple years of under billing our customers  we could be subject to significant assessments of past taxes  fines and interest  which could materially harm our financial condition 
adverse decisions or regulations of these taxing authorities could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business 
we are unable to predict the scope  pace or financial impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business 

table of contents the fcc is reexamining its policies towards voip and telecommunications in general 
new or existing regulation could subject us to additional fees or increase the competition we face 
we currently operate as a regulated common carrier  which subjects us to a number of regulatory obligations 
the fcc adopted rules applicable to interconnected voip providers  but it has not determined whether to classify interconnected voip providers as common carriers 
the rules applicable to interconnected voip providers require them to provide access to emergency services for all customers that are comparable to the services provided by traditional telephone networks  to implement certain capabilities for the monitoring of communications by law enforcement agencies pursuant to a subpoena or court order and to contribute to the federal universal service fund  among other requirements 
as a common carrier  we currently comply with the requirements  comply with the law enforcement assistance requirements applicable to traditional telecommunications carriers and contribute to the federal usf  and we also comply with the additional duties imposed on interconnected voip providers 
the fcc continues to examine its policies towards services provided over ip networks  such as our voip technology and broadband internet access services  and the results of these proceedings could impose additional obligations  fees or limitations on us 
regulatory decisions may also affect the level of competition we face 
reduced regulation of retail services offered by local telephone companies could increase the competitive advantages those companies enjoy  cause us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive or otherwise make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers 
our customer churn rate may increase 
customer churn occurs when a customer discontinues service with us  whether voluntary or involuntary  such as a customer going out of business or switching to a competitor 
changes in the economy  increased competition from other providers  or issues with the quality of service we deliver can impact our customer churn rate 
we cannot predict future pricing by our competitors  but we anticipate that price competition will continue 
lower prices offered by our competitors could contribute to an increase in customer churn 
higher customer churn rates could adversely impact our revenue growth 
a sustained and significant growth in the churn rate could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third party suppliers 
our success depends upon the quality  availability and price of these suppliers network equipment and software 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third party suppliers 
in addition  we rely on these suppliers for technical support and assistance 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with these suppliers  if any of them were to terminate our relationship or were to cease making the equipment and software we use  our ability to efficiently maintain  upgrade or expand our network could be impaired 
although we believe that we would be able to address our future equipment needs with equipment obtained from other suppliers  we cannot assure that such equipment would be compatible with our network without significant modifications or cost  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain the equipment necessary to maintain our network  our ability to attract and retain customers and provide our services would be impaired 
in addition  our success depends in part on our obtaining network equipment and software at affordable prices 
significant increases in the price of these products would harm our financial results and may increase our capital requirements 
we depend on third party vendors for information systems 
if these vendors discontinue support for the systems we use or fail to maintain quality in future software releases  we could incur substantial unplanned costs to switch or upgrade our systems or equipment  and we could sustain a negative impact on the quality of our services to customers  the development of new services and features and the quality of information needed to manage our business 
we have entered into agreements with vendors that provide for the development and operation of back office systems  such as ordering  provisioning and billing systems 
we also rely on vendors to provide the systems for monitoring the performance and condition of our network 
the failure of those vendors to perform their services in a timely and effective manner at acceptable costs could materially harm our growth and our ability to monitor costs  bill customers and carriers  provision customer orders  maintain the network and achieve operating efficiencies 
such a failure could also negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
we use software technology developed internally and by third party vendors  and hardware technology developed by third party vendors 
we or any of these vendors could be the subject of a lawsuit alleging a violation of the intellectual property of third parties 
we have created software systems  purchased software from third party vendors and purchased hardware from third party vendors 
our contracts with these vendors provide indemnification to us should any entity allege that we are violating its intellectual property 
should an entity bring suit or otherwise pursue intellectual property claims against us based on its own 
table of contents technology or the technology of third party vendors  the result of those claims could be to raise our costs or deny us access to technology currently necessary to our network or software systems 
if we are unable to generate the cash that we need to pursue our business plan  we may have to raise additional capital on terms unfavorable to our stockholders 
the actual amount of capital required to fund our operations and development may vary materially from our estimates 
if our operations fail to generate the cash that we expect  we may have to seek additional capital to fund our business 
if we are required to obtain additional funding in the future  we may have to sell assets  seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital 
in addition  the terms of our secured revolving line of credit or credit facility with bank of america subjects us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and any other indebtedness we incur in the future is likely to include similar covenants 
if we do not comply with such covenants  our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings 
if we raise funds by selling more stock  our stockholders ownership in us will be diluted  and we may grant future investors rights superior to those of the common stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may have to delay  modify or abandon some of our expansion plans 
this could slow our growth  negatively affect our ability to compete in our industry and adversely affect our financial condition 
if we cannot negotiate new or extensions of existing interconnection agreements with local telephone companies on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide service to our existing customers or to expand our business 
we have agreements for the interconnection of our network with the networks of the local telephone companies covering each market in which we operate 
these agreements also provide the framework for service to our customers when other local carriers are involved 
we will be required to negotiate new interconnection agreements to enter new markets in the future 
in addition  we will need to negotiate extension or replacement agreements as our existing interconnection agreements expire 
most of our interconnection agreements have terms of three years  although the parties may mutually decide to extend or amend the terms of such agreements 
if we cannot negotiate new interconnection agreements or extend or renew our existing interconnection agreements on favorable terms or at all  we may invoke binding arbitration by state regulatory agencies 
the arbitration process is expensive and time consuming  and the results of arbitration may be unfavorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain favorable interconnection terms  or if ilecs are relieved of their obligations to interconnect with us  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our markets 
the cloud based computing model presents execution and competitive risks 
we are transitioning to a computing environment characterized by cloud based services used with smart client devices 
our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based services for consumers and business customers 
pricing and delivery models are evolving 
devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud 
we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloud based software plus services strategies 
while we believe our expertise  investments in infrastructure  and the breadth of our cloud based services provides us with a strong foundation to compete  it is uncertain whether our strategies or technologies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful 
in addition to software development costs  we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud based services 
these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved 
whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas  including continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling cloud based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share  achieving and maintaining the utility  compatibility and performance of our cloud based services on the growing array of computing devices  including smartphones  handheld computers  netbooks  and tablets  and continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third party developers 
we have an mvno agreement with a nationwide wireless network provider 
if we cannot negotiate extensions of this agreement on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide mobile services to our existing customers or to expand our business 
we provide mobile services to our customers under a mobile virtual network operator or mvno  agreement with a nationwide wireless network provider 
upon or before expiration of the current contract term in  we will need to renew this agreement or enter an agreement with another provider 
in addition  we will need to negotiate amendments to our mvno agreement as services or technologies evolve in order to offer competitive services to our customers 
if we cannot renew our 
table of contents existing agreement  enter into an agreement with another provider or negotiate amendments on favorable terms or at all  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our current and new markets 
our current and future competitors may be better positioned than we are to adapt to rapid changes in technology  and we could lose customers as a result 
the communications industry has experienced  and will probably continue to experience  rapid and significant changes in technology 
technological changes  such as the use of wireless or other alternatives to provide network access to customers in place of the t or other access lines we lease from the local telephone companies  could render aspects of the technology we employ suboptimal or obsolete and provide a competitive advantage to new or larger competitors who might more easily be able to take advantage of these opportunities 
some of our competitors  including the local telephone companies  have a much longer operating history  more experience in making upgrades to their networks and greater financial resources than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain access to new technologies  that we will be able to do so as quickly or on the same terms as our competitors  or that we will be able to apply new technologies to our existing networks without incurring significant costs 
in addition  responding to demand for new technologies  such as our metro ethernet expansion  requires us to increase our capital expenditures  which may require additional financing in order to fund 
as a result of those factors  we could lose customers and our financial results could be harmed 
system disruptions could cause delays or interruptions of our service  which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses 
our success depends on our ability to provide reliable service 
although we have designed our network service to minimize the possibility of service disruptions or other outages  our service may be disrupted by problems on our system  such as malfunctions in our software or other facilities and overloading of our network  and problems with the systems of competitors with which we interconnect  such as physical damage to telephone lines  power surges and outages 
although we have experienced isolated power disruptions and other outages for short time periods  we have not had system wide disruptions of a sufficient duration or magnitude that have had a significant impact on our customers or our business 
any significant disruption in our network could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses 
business disruptions  including disruptions caused by security breaches  extreme weather  terrorism or other disasters  could harm our future operating results 
the day to day operation of our business is highly dependent on the integrity of our communications and information technology systems  and on our ability to protect those systems from damage or interruptions by events beyond our control 
sabotage  computer viruses or other infiltration by third parties could damage our systems 
such events could disrupt our service  damage our facilities  damage our reputation  and cause us to lose customers  among other things  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  a catastrophic event could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
catastrophic events could include a terrorist attack on the united states  a major natural disaster  extreme weather  earthquake  fire  or similar event that affects our central offices  corporate headquarters  network operations center  data centers or network equipment 
we believe that communications infrastructures  such as the one on which we rely  may be vulnerable in the case of such an event  and our markets  which are major metropolitan areas  may be more likely to be the targets of terrorist activity 
there is no assurance of profitability in the future 
we recorded net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will generate positive net income in the future 
future losses could require us to slow our growth and make other changes to our business plans 
if our goodwill or definite lived intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap  we review our definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances  indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or definite lived intangible assets is determined  negatively impacting our results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our common stock future sales of shares by existing stockholders or issuances of our common stock by us could reduce our stock price 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price of our common stock 
we may also issue shares of our common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments 
if any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of shares that we issue may  in turn  be significant 
in addition  we may grant registration rights covering those shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware corporate law might deter acquisition bids for us that our stockholders might consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors  the inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  to act by written consent  to remove any director or the entire board of directors without cause  or to fill any vacancy on the board of directors  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our board of directors is also permitted to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
these provisions and other provisions under delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
because we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
the continued expansion of our business will require substantial funding 
accordingly  we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on shares of our common stock 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  realization of a gain on stockholders investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares

table of contents in addition  we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful comparative measure within the communications industry because the industry has experienced merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense  and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies  as well as non operating or infrequent charges to earnings  such as the effect of debt restructurings 
accordingly  we believe adjusted ebitda allows analysts  investors and other interested parties in the communications industry to facilitate company to company comparisons by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
adjusted ebitda as used in this report may not  however  be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not directly comparable to earnings before interest and taxes or ebit or ebitda 
in addition  adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  any cash requirements for the replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized  which will often have to be replaced in the future  even though depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  and cash used for business acquisitions 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace operating income loss  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
rather  adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance to consider in addition to those measures 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda as a supplemental financial measure 
free cash flow free cash flow represents the cash that a company is able to generate after cash expenses and capital expenditures necessary to maintain or expand its asset base 
we believe that free cash flow is an important metric for investors in evaluating how a company is currently using cash generated and may indicate its ability to generate cash that can potentially be used by the business for capital investments  acquisitions  reduction of debt  payment of dividends or share repurchases 
internally  we have also begun to focus on free cash flow as an important operating performance metric and have designed our corporate bonus compensation plan to utilize free cash flow as a component 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
historically  we have defined free cash flow as adjusted ebitda less total capital expenditures 
during the first quarter of  we refined our definition of capital expenditures for purposes of calculating free cash flow to distinguish capital expenditures that require the up front outlay of cash from those where payment is deferred on a longer term basis 
this distinction is primarily driven by the significant investments we are making to lease fiber network assets that have an expected useful life of years  which is substantially longer than our typical asset lives 
we believe this distinction is warranted and appropriate since these investments are expected to yield meaningful positive cash flows in future periods when the debt and lease payments occur 
these favorable future cash flows will result from fiber infrastructure replacing a significant portion of the access and transport circuits we currently lease from incumbent local exchange carriers 
we have recast all historical disclosures of capital expenditures as well as free cash flow for all periods presented in this form k to be consistent with this delineation between cash and non cash capital expenditures

in this report  cbeyond  inc and its subsidiary are referred to as we  our  us  the company or cbeyond 
overview we first launched our service offering in atlanta in april and have since expanded service into additional metropolitan markets 
from inception  our strategy has been to package big business technologies and services for small and mid sized companies in convenient and affordable bundles that they generally could not obtain from any other single supplier 
this strategy is based on the belief that small and mid sized businesses highly value the capabilities and productivity such technologies and services enable  but do not generally have the resources  expertise  or time to purchase and manage them  particularly for the smaller scale of operations typical of our target customers 
our initial service offering conveniently bundled local and long distance voice services with t internet access with a higher level of quality and at a lower price than our customers could obtain by purchasing these services separately 
over time  we began adding new technologies and services to our bundles as they became available  including mobile voice and data  email  voicemail  web hosting  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  virtual private network  desktop security  microsoft exchange  mobile workforce management  virtual receptionist  mpls  metro ethernet broadband internet access  and other it and communications services 
understanding the capital and operating efficiencies  as well as enhanced data security  that off premise computing could bring to our customers  we acquired maximumasp and aretta in late to expand our it services into cloud computing with virtual and physical cloud servers and cloud pbx 
during  we completed the full integration of the operations of maximumasp and aretta into our existing operations under common functional leadership 
subsequent to these acquisitions  we began offering professional services to assist customers with their transition to cloud based services and have expanded these services to additional one time services  such as mpls network design  and recurring services  such as remote monitoring 
our four product families include totalnetwork  totalvoice  totalcloud  and totalassist  which reflect our service offerings that have evolved over time 
recognizing that our greatest value proposition for customers is when we are able to bring them those technologies and services that are more resource intensive or difficult to obtain and manage  we focus more of our selling and service delivery efforts toward small and mid sized businesses that are dependent on technology and have complex it needs 
our research enables us to define and quantify a segment of the small business customer market called the technology dependent customer 
technology dependent customers have the following characteristics the bulk of their employees use personal computers on the job  they have knowledge workers who need to share data from a centralized source  they have remote workers who need to access data on the go  they need symmetric metro ethernet to run their business  they are often multi location businesses  and they have a willingness to consider outsourcing their infrastructure as a way to preserve capital and increase both focus and productivity 
we announced this strategy in early and accelerated efforts to realign our distribution channels by building a new direct sales group dedicated to managing both existing and new technology dependent customers  reducing our traditional direct sales force  and consolidating certain offices 
this strategic realignment resulted in million of expense during we expect to complete the realignment during the first half of and incur approximately million of additional realignment charges 
in connection with our focus on technology dependent customers  we defined certain of our technology dependent customers as cbeyond customers 
cbeyond customers are those customers that we provide network access at speeds in excess of mbps or certain cloud based services  such as virtual servers  physical servers  or cloud pbx services 
in addition  we designate customers using our mpls service as cbeyond customers 
we refer to all other customers as cbeyond customers 
although cbeyond customers also frequently purchase cloud based services from us  we delineate between cbeyond and cbeyond based on how pervasive or significant we believe such services are to a customer s 
table of contents operation 
specifically  we consider the cloud based services that qualify a customer as cbeyond as infrastructure as a service in nature 
we believe the distinction is important because infrastructure services are generally longer term in nature  generate higher revenues and provide a gateway for software as a service products 
our cloud based services that do not qualify a customer as being designated cbeyond include products such as virtual receptionist  microsoft exchange hosting  web hosting  and fax to email  among others 
depending on the product  we host these types of services for between and of our customers and have been hosting such services for most of our existence  which gives us significant experience in operating in a cloud computing environment 
these cloud based services are typically included within our bundled services  but customers purchase additional quantities to meet their specific needs 
charges for additional services outside of our bundled package grew during the current year  from million in to million in we estimate that almost one half of our customers are technology dependent  but are not currently considered cbeyond customers because either they do not currently utilize cloud based solutions or advanced network services  or they obtain these services from other providers 
we believe this makes them strong prospects to become cbeyond customers 
during the fourth quarter of  we generated million  or  of revenue from cbeyond customers  which represents a increase over the amount recognized during the first quarter of we did not start tracking the comprehensive cbeyond customer base until  and thus we do not have comparable and meaningful prior year cbeyond customer revenue data 
we currently include all revenue from customers who purchase network access from us or network access customers within our average monthly revenue per customer location or arpu calculation 
thus  revenue from customers who purchase cloud based services independent of network access is excluded from arpu 
after considering all cloud based services  we believe that cbeyond customers currently provide over higher arpu than that of our cbeyond customers and we expect that percentage to grow over time 
we have not yet determined the revenue metrics that best represent the results of the consolidated business or the results from customers that purchase cloud based services independent of network access 
we focus our sales efforts on customers that purchase both network and cloud based services since we believe that these services  when combined  offer the greatest value proposition to customers and allows us significantly more control over the quality of service 
therefore  we do not expect revenue from customers that only purchase cloud based services to grow as quickly as revenue from customers who purchase both network access and cloud services from us 
year ended december  calculation of arpu dollar amounts in thousands  except arpu total revenue cloud only revenue a network access customer revenue b average network access customers arpu a b number of months in period during the third quarter of we began including revenue from certain cloud based services provided to network access customers within the arpu calculation that were not previously included 
we have recast all historical disclosures of arpu for all periods presented in this form k to conform to the current presentation 
as we accelerate sales of cloud based services to both new and existing technology dependent network access customers  we expect our revenue to include an increasing proportion of higher arpu cbeyond customers 
our concentrated focus on technology dependent customers was expected to result in little to no net growth in customers in and we expect this to continue in the near term  however  we expect that in the longer term our arpu and customer additions will increase as our customer mix becomes more oriented to those who are technology dependent and are using our services to satisfy their technology needs 
in addition  we expect that our future capital expenditures and operating expenses will continue to be more focused on selling to these types of customers 
operating expenses will include the cost of revenue to support a higher bandwidth metro ethernet network and the selling expenses of a more focused and consultative sales force 
capital expenditures will include the costs of building out a higher bandwidth network  additional hosting infrastructure  and product development 
during the first quarter of  we executed agreements to provide optical fiber access in multiple markets through long term capital leases of fiber infrastructure assets  including agreements for the indefeasible rights of use or iru of certain fiber network assets 
upon execution of these agreements  we took delivery of fiber assets and incurred future minimum capital lease obligations of million 
this obligation was partially satisfied in may through a million lump sum payment directly funded by our fiber loan 
during the remainder of  we took delivery of additional fiber assets with 
table of contents future minimum capital lease obligations of million 
the cash outlays for all obligations arising from our fiber assets will be either directly funded by our fiber loan or financed through fiber providers and will be payable by us through either as debt or capital lease obligations 
under these agreements  we have building access agreements or baas and outstanding construction orders for fiber assets with expected future minimum lease payments of million 
these commitments are not recognized on the balance sheet as of december  because they are contingent upon third parties completing construction and our testing and acceptance of the fiber assets 
as of december   we have placed additional construction orders that total million for which we have not yet obtained building access agreements 
we do not expect to be able to obtain building access agreements for every order placed 
therefore  we expect a portion of these orders may never be constructed 
additional construction orders may be placed under these contracts in the future 
through june   we were organized into three reportable segments core managed services established markets  core managed services emerging markets  and cloud services 
beginning in late and continuing into the third quarter of  we integrated substantially all administrative and operating functions of our former cloud services segment into the administrative and operating functions of our former core managed services segments 
sales and marketing functions have also been combined as we focus on selling integrated service bundles that include our cloud based services 
due to the advanced stage of our integration  during the third quarter of  our codm shifted his focus towards a product oriented structure rather than a geographic basis and began reviewing financial results on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated revenue information by product line 
accordingly  we revised our reportable segments to one reportable segment during the third quarter to reflect this change  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
our codm uses adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the business at a consolidated level 
we believe these are important performance metrics for evaluating our ability to generate cash that can potentially be used by the business for capital investments  acquisitions  reduction of debt  or potential payment of dividends or share repurchases 
we have also designed our corporate bonus compensation plan to include free cash flow as a component 
management believes that adjusted ebitda data should be available to investors so that investors have the same data that management employs in assessing operations 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure commonly used by investors  financial analysts and ratings agencies 
ebitda is generally defined as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
however  we use adjusted ebitda  also a non gaap financial measure  to further exclude  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering or acquisition related transaction costs  purchase accounting adjustments  gains or losses on asset dispositions  and non operating income or expense 
on a less frequent basis  adjusted ebitda may exclude charges for employee severances  asset or facility impairments  and other exit activity costs associated with a management directed plan collectively referred to as realignment costs 
historically  we have defined free cash flow as adjusted ebitda less total capital expenditures 
during the first quarter of  we refined our definition of capital expenditures for purposes of calculating free cash flow to distinguish capital expenditures that require the up front outlay of cash from those where payment is deferred on a longer term basis 
this distinction is driven primarily by the significant investments we are making to lease fiber network assets that have an expected useful life of years  which is substantially longer than our typical asset lives 
we believe this distinction is warranted and appropriate since these investments are expected to yield meaningful positive cash flows in future periods when the debt and lease payments occur 
these favorable future cash flows will result from fiber infrastructure replacing a portion of the access and transport circuits we currently lease from incumbent local exchange carriers

year ended december  reconciliation of capital expenditures in thousands cash capital expenditures non cash capital expenditures fiber capital lease assets equipment capital lease assets leasehold improvements total capital expenditures represents cash purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents adjusted ebitda was million in  an increase over free cash flow was million in compared to million in the growth in adjusted ebitda and free cash flow is primarily attributable to a reduction in capital expenditure subsequent to our copper based metro ethernet conversion efforts in and lower operating costs as a result of our strategic realignment

these adjustments affect period to period financial performance comparability in periods subsequent to the acquisition and are not indicative of changes in underlying results of operations 
we may have similar adjustments in future periods if we have any new acquisitions 
during  million of realignment costs are included in selling  general and administrative expense and million are included in depreciation and amortization 
revenue our revenue is disaggregated into network  voice and data or managed hosting and cloud 
managed hosting and cloud includes virtual servers  physical servers  and cloud pbx services to customers and distribution channels that are not limited by geographical location 
our focus is to provide these services to network access customers  however  certain customers purchase these cloud based services independent of network access 
managed hosting and cloud also includes other services  such as virtual receptionist  microsoft exchange hosting  web hosting  and fax to email  that are purchased by network access customers in quantities that exceed those included in their bundled service package 
we seek to sell our services through three year contracts  but also offer one year and two year contracts at generally higher prices 
as a result  customer churn rates impact our projected future revenue streams 
we define customer churn rate for a given month as the number of network access customers disconnected in that month divided by the total number of network access customers at the beginning of that month 
due to differences in arpu between cbeyond customers and cbeyond customers  we believe a unit based churn metric is likely to become less meaningful than it has been historically 
in the future  we intend to transition to a revenue based churn metric that will be applicable to all revenue  including revenue from customers that purchase cloud based services independent of network access 
although not a significant source of our network  voice and data revenue  we charge other communications companies for terminating calls to our customers on our network 
terminating access charges have historically grown at a slower rate than our customer base due to reductions in access rates on interstate calls as mandated by the federal communications commission 
these rate reductions are expected to continue in the future 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue represents costs directly related to the operation of our network and includes payments for access circuits  interconnection and transport fees  customer circuit installation costs  fees paid for web hosting services  collocation rents and other facility costs  telecommunications related taxes and fees  and the cost of mobile handsets 
cost of revenue associated with our cloud based services includes licensing fees for the required operating systems  broadband service and access fees  and power for our data center facilities 

table of contents the primary component of cost of revenue consists of the access fees paid to local telephone companies for high capacity circuits we lease on a monthly basis to provide connectivity to our customers 
these access circuits link our customers to our network equipment located in a collocation facility  which we also lease from local telephone companies 
historically  most of the high capacity circuits we leased have been t s  which are the largest component of our circuit access fees 
however  we are converting many of our existing customer t circuits and have begun serving new customers using metro ethernet in place of t circuits in a number of locations 
although not available to us on an ubiquitous basis in all areas  ethernet technology provides us with the opportunity to offer a large percentage of our customers bandwidth at speeds well in excess of t circuits while reducing our ongoing operating expenses 
we substantially completed our copper based metro ethernet customer conversion project in and in we shifted our focus to our optical fiber access initiative 
costs related to our fiber network include lease payments and maintenance costs for dark fiber or fiber provided by third parties operated by us and access fees for lit fiber or fiber operated by third parties 
we expect these costs to increase in as we expand our fiber network 
a rising component of cost of revenue is transport cost  which is primarily the cost we incur with ilecs for traffic between central offices where we have collocation equipment  traffic between wire centers without our presence and our collocations  and intercity traffic between our markets 
these costs have increased in the near term as we have built additional collocations to support our metro ethernet initiative  however  we expect that the increased transport costs will be offset by greater reductions in future access fees resulting from our investment in ethernet technology  which provides significantly lower operating expenses than traditional t technology 
another significant component of our cost of revenue is the cost associated with our mobile offering 
these costs include usage based charges  monthly recurring base charges  or some combination thereof  depending on the type of mobile product in service and the cost of mobile equipment sold to our customers 
the cost of mobile devices typically exceeds our selling price due to the highly competitive marketplace and traditional pricing practices for mobile services 
we believe these costs are offset over time by the long term profitability of our service contracts 
we routinely negotiate and receive telecommunication cost recoveries from various local telephone companies to resolve prior errors in billing  including the effect of price decreases retroactively applied upon the adoption of new rates as mandated by regulatory bodies 
we also receive payments from local telephone companies in the form of performance penalties that are assessed by state regulatory commissions based on the local telephone companies performance in the delivery of circuits and other services 
because of the many factors that impact the amount and timing of telecommunication cost recoveries  we are often unable to estimate the outcome of these situations 
accordingly  we generally recognize telecommunication cost recoveries as offsets to cost of revenue when the ultimate resolution and amount are known and verifiable 
these items do not follow any predictable trends and often result in variances when comparing the amounts received over multiple periods 
in the future  through systematic improvements in process applications  and after gaining further historical experience  we may be able to more reliably estimate the outcome of telecommunication cost recoveries prior to being known and verifiable  which could result in earlier recognition of these recoveries 
selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense consist of salaries and related costs for employees and other costs related to sales and marketing  engineering  information technology  billing  regulatory  administrative  collections  legal  and accounting functions 
in addition  bad debt expense and share based compensation expense are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense includes both fixed and variable costs 
fixed costs include the cost of staffing certain corporate functions such as it  marketing  administrative  billing and engineering  and associated costs  such as office rent  legal and accounting fees  property taxes  and recruiting costs 
variable costs include commissions  bonuses  marketing materials  the cost of provisioning and customer activation staff  which varies with the level of installation of new customers  and the cost of customer care and technical support staff  which varies with the level of total customers on our network  and the complexity of our product offering 
reclassifications reclassifications have been made to the and revenue table within item herein to present our revenue on a product line basis  separating network  voice and data from managed hosting and cloud 
reclassifications have also been made to arpu within item herein to include revenue from certain cloud based services provided to network access customers within the calculation that were not previously included 
such reclassifications were made to conform to the current year presentation 

table of contents consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue dollar amounts in thousands  except arpu for the year ended december  change from previous period dollars of revenue dollars of revenue dollars percent revenue network  voice and data managed hosting and cloud total revenue cost of revenue gross margin exclusive of depreciation and amortization network access customer data customer locations at period end arpu average monthly churn rate total revenue slightly increased during compared to due to our efforts to realign our distribution channels by building a new direct sales group dedicated to technology dependent customers and reducing our traditional direct sales force 
this focus on our realignment and on higher value customers resulted in lower new customer acquisition by our sales force than we have achieved historically 
because of this  customer churn exceeded new customer growth and resulted in a decline in customers 
the revenue impact of the decline in customers was largely offset by increases in fees we charge our customers to recover certain regulatory costs 
we expect these regulatory charges to have a continuing benefit in future periods 
the impact of such fees in will be more significant as compared to managed hosting and cloud revenue increased in largely due to the introduction of additional cloud based service offerings 
we expect revenue growth to return as our cbeyond sales force increases in number and productivity  and as we refine and expand our catalog of products targeted to technology dependent customers and further expand our metro ethernet network 
arpu declined for  compared to  which is an improvement over the decline for compared to the decline in arpu is primarily due to existing customers converting to lower priced packages  decreased charges for usage above levels of voice minutes included in our packages  customers reducing the number of additional lines and services with incremental charges  and a decline in the number of customers utilizing our mobile services 
we believe the decline is also related to the economic conditions faced by our customers and continued competitive pressures from alternate communications providers  such as cable companies 
these negative factors were primarily offset by the increases noted above 
arpu may continue to decline in the short term for the reasons noted above  however  we anticipate that our focus on selling sophisticated solutions to technology dependent customers will decrease the rate of decline by increasing the proportion of new  higher arpu  technology dependent customers 
longer term  we expect that our focus on technology dependent customers  or cbeyond customers  and new product launches will increasingly benefit arpu 
this expectation is evident by the current shift we are seeing between network  voice and data revenue  which declined in  and managed hosting and cloud revenue  which increased in these results reflect the launch of our flagship cloud offerings  totalcloud phone system and totalcloud data center  during the fourth quarter of our average customer churn rate was for  representing a slight increase over prior periods 
the increase from for is primarily attributable to price competition for smaller communications centric customers 

table of contents cost of revenue dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change from previous period dollars of revenue dollars of revenue dollars percent cost of revenue exclusive of depreciation and amortization circuit access fees other cost of revenue transport cost mobile cost telecommunications cost recoveries total cost of revenue the principal drivers of the overall decrease in cost of revenue are the reduction in installation costs from fewer new customer installations and reduced costs related to the copper based metro ethernet conversion project  which was substantially complete at the end of  and a reduction in mobile related costs 
these cost reductions were partially offset by higher circuit costs attributable to delivering higher bandwidth circuits to our customers  and costs relating to additional collocation facilities added to support the metro ethernet expansion 
circuit access fees  or line charges  represent the largest single component of cost of revenue 
these costs primarily relate to our lease of circuits connecting our equipment at network points of collocation to our equipment located at our customers premises 
the increase in circuit access fees has historically correlated to changes in the number of customers  but there are a number of influences in recent periods that have reduced the level of correlation 
we are realizing expected cost savings from our metro ethernet conversion initiative  but are also experiencing increases as we provide higher bandwidth to our customers 
a portion of our cost savings relates to a reduction in direct and indirect costs associated with migrating customers to metro ethernet technology from million in to million in as we serve more technology dependent customers with higher bandwidth needs  we expect access costs to initially increase 
these customers  however  will also generate much higher revenue due to the breadth and type of services enabled by higher bandwidth 
over time  as we increasingly leverage our own fiber assets we expect our access costs on a per customer basis to decline 
other cost of revenue includes components such as long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of local interconnection with ilecs networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party service offerings we provide to our customers  costs to deliver our cloud based services  and certain taxes and fees 
other cost of revenue decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in new customer installations and a reduction of approximately million in costs related to the copper based metro ethernet conversion project  which was substantially completed in transport cost is a rising component of cost of revenue and has risen at a rate outpacing customer growth as we build additional collocations to support our metro ethernet initiative 
this trend will continue for the near term 
longer term  we expect transport costs to decline given the cost profile of ethernet access versus traditional t access 
as a percentage of revenue  mobile costs decreased during compared to primary drivers of this decrease include a reduction in mobile service costs and mobile device costs due to lower volume 
the reduction in shipments relates to the decrease in new customers and a decrease in the rate of new customers electing mobile services 
though we do not currently anticipate significant changes in the percentage of customers using our mobile services in the future  we have been selling more recent and competitive mobile device models 
as such  we do not anticipate mobile costs will continue to decline from current levels in the long term

salaries  wages and benefits decreased during compared to the prior year due to a lower number of average employees as a result of our strategic realignment  which resulted in a workforce reductions during the first and second quarters of the savings that resulted from our strategic realignment were partially offset throughout the remainder of the year as we continued to invest in our cbeyond sales force and staffing our operations to support our focus on technology dependent customers 
salaries  wages and benefits was also affected by higher employee bonus expense in compared to share based compensation expense decreased during compared to  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of awards granted based on lower share prices in recent periods 
as our share price has declined  we have experienced decreases in our share based compensation expense related to the full vesting of higher historical valued awards granted 
this is partially offset by increased share based compensation costs related to our corporate bonus plan as all corporate employees now receive of their bonus in shares 
marketing costs decreased in compared to due to lower advertising and promotional activity as we reduced costs while focusing on our strategic realignment 
this decline is not expected to continue in the future as we focus on technology dependent customers 
the strategic realignment  which was announced in early  resulted in million of selling  general and administrative expense in this expense primarily consisted of million for employee severances and benefits  and million for losses under non cancelable office leases 
other selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes  and bad debt expense 
the decrease in this category of costs is primarily due to streamlining operations as part of our strategic realignment effort and stronger overall cost controls due to slowing revenue growth 
this decrease is not expected to continue in the future as we focus on serving technology dependent customers 
bad debt expense was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  during and  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization in compared to relates primarily to a increase in depreciable fixed assets over the prior period

during  we recognized other income of million  which primarily relates to adjusting liabilities of our former captive leasing subsidiaries upon the expiration of various statutory periods see 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the income tax expense primarily relates to the increase in our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income  and state income taxes payable in markets in which we do not have net operating loss carryforwards 
included in state income tax expense are gross receipts based taxes levied by texas that are due regardless of income levels 
since this tax is not dependent upon levels of income  it has a significant influence on our effective tax rate 
additionally  income tax expense reflects amounts associated with share based transactions  which are described in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  and primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income 
our evaluation led us to increase our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of by million  resulting in additional income tax expense 
our deferred tax assets are now fully reserved by the valuation allowance 
in addition to our fully reserved net deferred tax assets  we have a deferred tax liability of million  which relates to tax amortization for goodwill

circuit access fees increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a decrease in arpu 
we expect circuit access fees as a percentage of revenue to stabilize over time as we convert customers to metro ethernet  which we expect will reduce operating costs  and as arpu stabilizes 
other cost of revenue principally includes long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party service offerings we provide to our customers  costs to deliver our cloud based services  and certain taxes and fees 
other cost of revenue increased as a percentage of revenue in compared to primarily due to customer growth outpacing revenue growth 
in addition  we experienced a million increase in installation costs during relating to the copper based metro ethernet initiative 
transport cost is a rising component of cost of revenue and has risen at a rate outpacing customer growth as we build additional collocations to support our metro ethernet initiative 
this trend will continue for the near term 
longer term  we expect transport costs to decline on a per customer basis given the cost profile of ethernet access versus traditional t access 
as a percentage of revenue  mobile costs decreased in compared to the primary drivers of this decrease are reductions in service costs due to lower negotiated rates and mobile device costs due to lower volumes 
the reduction in shipments stems from a lower percentage of new customers electing mobile services primarily due to a reduction in our use of promotional and other incentives 
selling  general and administrative and other operating expenses dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change from previous period dollars of revenue dollars of revenue dollars percent selling  general and administrative exclusive of depreciation and amortization salaries  wages and benefits exclusive of share based compensation share based compensation marketing cost acquisition related benefit expense other selling  general and administrative total sg a other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total other operating expenses other data average employees selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  primarily due to increased employee salaries  wages and benefits 
the inclusion of our acquisitions for a full year in contributed an additional million of costs 
total selling  general and administrative expenses also includes million in employee costs and other expenses associated with migrating customers to copper based metro ethernet during the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is partially offset by certain decreased expenses  including bad debt expense and share based compensation 
higher employee costs  which include salaries  wages  benefits  and other compensation paid to our direct sales representatives and sales agents  related to the additional employees necessary to staff newer markets and serve the growth in customers 
we also incurred approximately million more in compensation costs in due to employees at acquired entities who were with us for the full year 
overall  the increase in salaries  wages and benefits over the prior respective period was consistent with the growth in the average number of employees 
as a percentage of revenue  employee costs during remained consistent with the prior period 
during the third and fourth quarters of  management recommended and the board of directors approved to reduce the accrued payout level under our corporate incentive plan based on management assessment that the quality of results warranted a lower achievement level than expected under the plan 
table of contents parameters 
we believed this amendment to the plan better aligned management compensation with the interests of stockholders 
these actions resulted in a million reduction to employee costs during share based compensation expense decreased overall and as a percentage of revenue in compared to  primarily due to a decline in the fair value of awards granted based on lower share prices in recent periods 
as our share price has declined  we have experienced decreases in our share based compensation expense related to the full vesting of higher historical valued awards granted 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the vesting of certain non employee performance awards was no longer considered probable 
marketing costs decreased in compared to primarily due to lower advertising and promotional activity as we reduced costs while focusing on our strategic realignment 
acquisition related benefit expense during includes a million fair value adjustment to reduce our contingent consideration liability related to the maximumasp acquisition based on actual revenue achievement 
in  acquisition related benefit expense primarily includes direct transaction costs associated with our acquisitions  which includes accounting  legal  and other professional fees 
other selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes  and bad debt expense 
the increase in this category of costs was primarily due to the addition of new and expanded operations needed to keep pace with the growth in customers 
the improvement as a percentage of revenue is partially attributable to improved bad debt expense over the prior year and stronger overall cost controls as we scale back overhead growth due to slowing revenue growth 
bad debt expense was million  or of total revenue in  compared to million  or of revenues in this decline was primarily from stronger cash collections and more stringent credit policies in place during the increase in depreciation and amortization in compared to relates primarily to a increase in capital expenditures during compared to in addition  we recognized million of depreciation and amortization in from assets acquired through our acquisitions in late other income expense and income taxes dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change from previous period dollars of revenue dollars of revenue dollars percent interest expense  net other income  net income tax expense total the majority of our interest expenses in and relate to commitment fees under our credit facility 
accordingly  interest expense was higher in due to the increase in our credit facility from million to million early in and then to million early in we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december  during and  we recognized other income of million and million  respectively  which primarily relates to adjusting liabilities of our former captive leasing subsidiaries upon the expiration of various statutory periods see 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded income tax expense despite having a pre tax loss of million due to income taxes in states with gross receipts based taxes  which are due regardless of profit levels  the write off of certain deferred tax assets associated with share based transactions see 
note to the consolidated financial statements  and an increase in our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
we also recorded income tax expense in on a pre tax loss of million 
since gross receipts based taxes are not dependent upon levels of pre tax income and because we are near break even at a pre tax level  these taxes have a significant influence on our effective tax rate 
as the operating results for the markets in these states become proportionately less significant to the consolidated results and as consolidated pre tax income increases  the impact of these gross receipts based taxes on our effective tax rate will decline 
we recorded income tax expense in related to increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
in  income tax expense was benefited by million due to reductions in the valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  and primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards 
we maintain a valuation allowance  which reduces our net deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  ongoing tax planning 
table of contents and forecasts of future taxable income 
our evaluation led us to increase our valuation allowance by million in the fourth quarter of  resulting in additional income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands change from previous period for the year ended december  dollars percent v v v v cash flows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities nm net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of december   we have million of cash and cash equivalents held in our operating bank accounts  million outstanding under the fiber loan  and no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
we currently have no plans to draw against the credit facility for short term needs 
we substantially completed our copper based metro ethernet customer conversion project in and have shifted our focus to our optical fiber access initiative 
during  we executed multiple agreements to provide optical fiber access in several markets 
we expect to incur costs of between million and million through associated with the initial phase of this initiative 
the fiber loan  secured under our amended and restated credit facility  provides us up to million to finance the purchase of fiber network assets from a third party 
during  we made cash payments for share repurchases and acquisition related consideration  which are not expected to occur on a frequent basis 
in addition  during  we reduced our communications centric  or cbeyond  sales force in order to reinvest in teams focused on delivering services to technology dependent customers 
this realignment resulted in cash payments of million for employee severances and benefits and million for other costs 
these reductions in personnel resulted in a significant temporary increase in free cash flow 
although we anticipate that free cash flow will remain positive in the foreseeable future  by the fourth quarter of the expense savings were largely offset by the growth in staffing for our cbeyond sales channels 
accordingly  we expect lower levels of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow throughout we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities  and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  debt and capital lease obligations  operating expenses  and other cash requirements associated with future growth 
while we do not anticipate a need for additional access to capital or new financing aside from our credit facility and related fiber loan  we monitor the capital markets and may access those markets if our business prospects or plans change resulting in a need for additional capital  or if additional capital required can be obtained on favorable terms 
cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers  offset by cash payments for circuit access fees  employee compensation less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities  and operating leases 
cash received from our customers generally corresponds to our revenue 
because our credit terms are typically less than one month  our receivables settle quickly 
changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and changes to the components of working capital  including changes to receivable and payable days 
operating cash flows may fluctuate favorably or unfavorably depending on the timing of significant vendor payments 
operating cash flows increased by million in primarily due to the reduction in our traditional cbeyond sales force in connection with our strategic realignment efforts  which temporarily lowered our operating costs 
operating cash flows decreased in compared to primarily due to a greater net loss  resulting in million of reduced cash flows  higher bonus payments of million  which are paid annually during the first quarter  and lease payment escalations for our facilities over that of the prior year 
as previously discussed  during we also incurred million of direct and indirect costs of our copper based metro ethernet conversion initiative 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities our principal cash investments are purchases of property and equipment  which fluctuate depending on the growth in customers in our existing markets  the timing and number of facility and network additions needed to expand existing markets and upgrade our network  enhancements and development costs related to our operational support systems in order to offer additional applications and services to our customers  and increases to the capacity of our data centers as our customer base and the product portfolio expand 
we believe that capital efficiency is a key advantage of the ip based network technology that we employ 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased in primarily due to a reduction in cash capital expenditures as we substantially completed the copper based metro ethernet initiative in we continue to invest in metro ethernet through optical fiber access to reduce operating expenses and provide higher bandwidth and additional services to our customers 
our cash capital expenditures decreased from million in to million in during  we also acquired million of fiber network assets and million of servers and computer equipment through capital lease arrangements that did not require an initial outlay of cash 
we also paid million in deferred acquisition consideration related to our acquisitions of maximumasp and aretta in compared to million in we closed these acquisitions in and paid closing date consideration of million  net of cash acquired 
additionally  during  we transferred million of cash formerly classified as restricted cash into our operating account 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities relate to activity associated with employee stock option exercises  vesting of restricted shares  financing costs associated with the amendments to our credit facility  repurchases of common stock  and principal payments on capital leases 
during the first quarter of  we borrowed million against our credit facility  most of which was used to settle acquisition related contingent consideration 
we repaid this borrowing during the second quarter of as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility and million outstanding under our fiber loan 
we also repurchased million shares for million during and million shares for million during under the million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may commitments the following table summarizes our commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years capital lease obligations fiber lease commitments operating lease obligations circuit commitments purchase obligations long term debt payments anticipated interest payments total capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments 
capital lease obligations presented above include payments of both principal and interest 
fiber lease commitments represent outstanding construction orders for fiber network assets for which we have obtained building access agreements 
these commitments are not recognized on our balance sheet because they are contingent upon third parties completing construction and our testing and acceptance of the assets 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under our non cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year and fees to landlords under building access agreements to procure access to multi tenant office buildings 
circuit commitments include minimum lease agreements for customer circuits from ilecs

also included are contractual maintenance fees related to our leased fiber network 
long term debt payments represent principal payments under our fiber loan 
anticipated interest payments represent commitment fees related to our credit facility 
in february  we entered into an agreement with a vendor that includes estimated minimum purchase commitments of million in  million in  million in  and million in 
table of contents credit facility we are party to a credit agreement with bank of america or credit facility  which provides for a million secured revolving line of credit and a million senior secured delayed draw term loan or fiber loan 
our credit facility is available to finance working capital  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   million of the revolving line of credit was utilized for letters of credit and we had million in remaining availability 
additionally  we had million outstanding under the fiber loan at an annual interest rate of and had remaining availability of million 
on march   we entered into the sixth amendment of the credit facility to increase the allowable capital lease amounts under the agreement from million to million 
on may   we amended and restated our credit facility to provide the million fiber loan 
on march   we entered into the first amendment to the amended and restated credit facility to increase the allowable capital lease and permitted acquisitions amounts from million to million 
we also amended the financial covenants of the credit facility  replacing the covenants requiring us to maintain minimum levels of adjusted ebitda and maximum levels of annual capital expenditures with a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
additionally  we extended the maturity date of the credit facility including the fiber loan to may  and extended the draw period of the fiber loan to december  fiber loan principal payments are due in quarterly installments as early as june through the maturity date of may  the following description of the credit facility briefly summarizes the terms and conditions that are material to us 
interest and fees the interest rates applicable to loans under the credit facility are floating interest rates that  at our option  will equal a london interbank offered rate or libor or an alternate base rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the current base rate is a fluctuating interest rate equal to the higher of a the prime rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by bank of america  as administrative agent  as its prime rate in effect at its principal office in new york city  b the overnight federal funds rate plus  and c the eurodollar base rate plus 
the interest periods of the eurodollar loans are one  two  three or six months  at our option 
the amended applicable margins for libor loans or alternate base rate loans are and  respectively 
in addition  we are required to pay to bank of america a commitment fee for unused commitments at a per annum rate of 
security the credit facility is secured by all assets of cbeyond communications  llc or llc and is guaranteed by cbeyond  inc all assets of the consolidated entity reside with llc 
in addition  cbeyond  inc has no operations other than those conducted by llc 
accordingly  all income and cash flows from operations are generated by and belong to llc and all assets appearing on the consolidated financial statements secure the credit facility 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that effectively prohibit us from paying cash dividends 
covenants and other matters under the terms of the amended and restated credit facility  we are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictive covenants  which limit  among other items  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments  pay cash dividends  sell or acquire assets  and grant security interests in our assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain customary negative covenants  representations and warranties  affirmative covenants  notice provisions  indemnification and events of default  including change of control  cross defaults to other debt  and judgment defaults 
through the maturity date of the credit facility  we are required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio less than or equal to to we are also required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio greater than or equal to to as of december   we are in compliance with all applicable covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in 
note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  those discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are therefore considered critical 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
software development we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of certain internal use software projects 
we monitor software development projects to ensure that only those costs relating to development activities  including software design and configuration  coding  installation  testing  and parallel processing  are capitalized 
determining the phase of software development or enhancement that is eligible for capitalization requires judgment  which may affect the amount and timing of both the related capitalization and subsequent depreciation 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus resulting in capitalization 
all other software development costs are expensed as incurred 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over estimated useful lives of the software 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts through charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the allowance is established based upon the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and is estimated based on a number of factors  including a specific customer ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience  and the general economic environment 
customer accounts are generally considered delinquent when payments are forty five days past due and the service disconnection process begins 
customer accounts are typically written off against the allowance sixty to ninety days after service disconnection  when our direct collection efforts cease 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of our expenses could result 
share based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation  we account for shared based compensation expense using the fair value recognition provisions of asc share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award as calculated by the lattice trinomial option pricing model and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  after estimating the effect of forfeitures 
option valuation models involve input assumptions that are subjective  and hence  may result in an option value that is not equal to that of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller 
additionally  estimated forfeiture rates are based on historical data  and may not be indicative of future forfeiture behavior 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
we made assumptions  judgments  and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and allowable deductions 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws could materially impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income or 
table of contents loss in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments  and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset is designed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards for information about recently issued accounting standards  refer to 
note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our variable rate borrowings under our credit facility are subject to fluctuations in interest expense and cash flows 
management actively monitors this exposure when present 
at december   we utilized million of our fiber loan 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an increase in pre tax interest expense of less than million 
as we continue to draw on our fiber loan  our sensitivity to interest rate risk will increase 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were held in non interest bearing bank accounts 
we do not enter into any interest rate instruments for trading purposes
