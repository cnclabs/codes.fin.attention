overview we are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics  cytokines or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
our lead product candidate  epratuzumab  is currently in two phase iii clinical trials in lupus 
in oncology  we are planning to launch a phase iii pivotal trial for clivatuzumab labeled with a radioisotope in pancreatic cancer patients 
other solid tumor therapeutics in phase ii clinical development include antibody drug conjugates  labetuzumab sn immu and hrs sn immu 
we also have a majority ownership in ibc pharmaceuticals  inc  which is developing a novel dock and lock dnl method with us for making fusion proteins and multifunctional antibodies 
dnl is being used particularly to make bispecific antibodies targeting cancers and infectious diseases as a t cell redirecting immunotherapy  as well as bispecific antibodies for next generation cancer and autoimmune disease therapies 
we have also been one of the first companies to test antibody combinations as a possibly improved method of cancer therapy  and as a result have also embarked on the development of bispecific bifunctional monoclonal antibodies targeting two distinct antigens on the same cancer cells 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately active patents in the us and more than other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we have continued to transition our focus away from the development and commercialization of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we manufacture and commercialize our leukoscan product in territories where regulatory approvals have previously been granted 
leukoscan is indicated for diagnostic imaging for determining the location and extent of infection inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis  including patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
from inception in through june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
see risk factors under item a in this annual report on form k for other factors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have accounted for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables as a separate unit of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we allocate revenue consideration  excluding contingent consideration  based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables 
relative selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence or our best estimate of selling price is used for each deliverable 
payments received under contracts to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where we have continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best evidential matter available at each reporting period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition at the inception of a collaboration agreement 
the criteria requires that i we determine if the milestone is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
revenue from the sale of diagnostic products is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive income loss  including long term investments in consolidated subsidiaries 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income loss 
stock based compensation we currently have an employee share option plan  or the plan  which permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees  of which million stock options were still available for future grant 
a summary of this plan is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant  those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have seven year contractual terms 
certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the plan 
the fair value of each option granted during the years ended june   and is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in the following table years ended june  expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate the weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during the years ended june   and were  and per share  respectively 
we used historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected stock price volatility was calculated using our daily stock trading history 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have a total of  shares underlying non vested options and restricted stock grants outstanding as of june  as of june   and there was million  million and million  respectively  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the weighted average remaining contractual terms of the exercisable shares is years and years as of june  and  respectively 
reimbursement of research development costs research and development costs that are reimbursable under collaboration agreements are included as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we record these reimbursements as a reduction of research and development expenses as our partner in the collaboration agreement has the financial risks and responsibility for conducting these research and development activities 
impairment of assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of our ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
based on our review  we believe there is no impairment at june  manufacturing costs manufacturing costs incurred in relation to the development of materials produced in order to fulfill contractual obligations are capitalized and are recorded in other current assets until the product is delivered in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
life insurance policies we have life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  which are for the benefit of the company 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  we recognize the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset on the balance sheet 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to million of non recurring license fee revenue earned during fiscal under the terms of the amendment agreement with ucb 
product sales of leukoscan in europe for the years ended june  and were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  as sales volume of leukoscan in europe has declined from the prior year as a result of regulatory filings that are currently in process which has limited the supply of leukoscan available for sale 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or  due to the timing of grant programs in the current period and increase in the number of grant programs during the current year 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  this increase resulted primarily from an increase of million of clinical trial related expenses largely driven by increased costs for the clivatuzumab phase ib clinical trial completed during fiscal year  and antibody drug conjugates clinical trials and a decrease of million of research and development expense reimbursements from the previous year 
cost of goods sold was million in each of the fiscal years ended june  and gross profit margins were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses for each of the years ended june  and were million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  due primarily to insurance and employee related expenses 
arbitration settlement  net on april   we initiated an arbitration proceeding before finra against its former investment advisor broker dealer  banc of america investment services  inc and banc of america securities  llc  relating to its prior investment in certain securities 
on march  we reached a settlement in such matter 
pursuant to the settlement  we received a gross settlement amount of million  dismissed the proceeding with prejudice  and together with the broker dealer  released each other from all claims and liabilities arising out of the arbitration 
we received the net amount of approximately million after payment of expenses and legal fees 
insurance proceeds insurance proceeds totaling million were received during the year ended june  as a result of insurance claims for an equipment failure during the fiscal year 
a cash payment for a business interruption insurance claim of million was received in october  which had resulted from the equipment failure that had limited the production of materials necessary for certain research and product development 
there was no such claim for the previous year 
in addition  proceeds of million were also received in september for a property claim regarding the same equipment failure 
income tax expense income tax expense was thousand and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
income tax expense in was higher than in due to profitability in domestic operations in fiscal year income tax expense for both periods includes income taxes on profitable foreign operations 
net income attributable to immunomedics  inc net loss attributable to immunomedics  inc common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share  as compared to net income of million  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in license fee revenue 
in fiscal  million of license fee revenue was earned by us under the terms of the amendment agreement with ucb whereby ucb received the right to sublicense to a third party subject to our consent of the sublicensee and sublicensing agreement  a license to develop  manufacture  market and sell our drug epratuzumab  for the united states and certain other territories 
during the fiscal year  we recognized as revenue the receipt of million for milestone payments under the terms of the nycomed agreement 
product sales of leukoscan in europe were comparable for each of the years ended june  and at million and million  respectively 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or  due to a decline in government funded research grants 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of million  or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  this decrease resulted primarily from million of lower spending for clinical trials  partially offset by higher outside services 
reimbursement of research and development expenses for the fiscal year increased to million compared to million in fiscal  but is expected to decline significantly subsequent to june  cost of goods sold was million in each of the fiscal years ended june  and gross profit margins were for both the and fiscal years 
sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at million for both the and fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to million of decreased legal expenses principally related to lower expenses pertaining to the finra arbitration hearing and other legal matters for the year ended this decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by recognition of additional incentive compensation to our chairman in accordance with his employment agreement resulting from the company s profitability for the fiscal year 
qualifying therapeutic discovery project program qtdp on october   we were awarded a cash grant of approximately million under the qtdp program administered under section d of the internal revenue code 
we recognized the full million of the grant as of the date of notification since we had already incurred all of the qualifying expenses as of the date of notification 
since this program was non recurring in nature  we elected to classify this payment as other income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss income for the year ended june  there was no similar program in the fiscal year ended june  gain on sales and redemptions on auction rate securities ars a gain of million was reported for the year ended june  on the sales and redemptions of ars with a carrying value of million par value of million 
there were no such sales for the fiscal year ended june  interest and other income interest and other income of thousand for the year ended june  decreased from million for the same period in this decline was primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of the amortization of the discount for the auction rate securities of million 
income tax expense income tax expense of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  was the result of income taxes for the domestic and foreign operations 
net income attributable to immunomedics  inc net income attributable to immunomedics  inc common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share as compared to net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our product candidates in development were million for fiscal year ended june   million for fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal year  or  as compared to fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million in fiscal year  or  as compared to fiscal we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple product candidates at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consist of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs decreased by million  or  for the year ended june  compared to june  research costs increased by million  or  for the year ended june  compared to june  the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  due to higher employee turnover offset by salary increases 
personnel costs were million for and million in  the increase was due to salary increases and low employee turnover 
the use of outside research and testing services in fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease resulted from less outside testing required for the current year s research projects 
the use of outside research and testing services in fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  over this increase was primarily the result of increased outside research and testing procedures 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to research based on research spending levels for fiscal was million as compared to million in this decrease was a result of greater emphasis on spending in the product development area as compared to the research area and therefore a lower level of indirect spending to be absorbed into the research category 
for fiscal these expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of million  or  primarily as a result of increased employee related costs 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total increased by million  or  to million as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by million or to million as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were million as compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million primarily due to the increased costs resulting from the clivatuzumab phase ib clinical trial that was completed during fiscal year and the new antibody drug conjugates clinical trials 
clinical trial expenses in fiscal year of million represented a decrease of million  or  from this reduction was primarily the result of the completion of the clivatuzumab tetraxetan hpam phase iib clinical trial during the fiscal year 
previously the company has benefited from cost efficiencies realized on labor and overhead as a result of efforts on the development of veltuzumab for takeda nycomed  for which the company has been reimbursed 
in fiscal  the level of reimbursement received from takeda nycomed decreased from million received in fiscal to million 
in fiscal  the level of reimbursement received from takeda nycomed increased million  from million received in the company expects the reimbursement from takeda nycomed for fiscal to remain at the level or to decline further 
personnel costs in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to  primarily due to increased hiring in the product development area for manufacturing requirements and additional clinical trial activity  as well as salary increases 
personnel costs in fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to  with salary increases in offset by lower employee levels during the year 
patent expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from patent expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from the reductions were primarily due to the completion of patent related expenses for legal actions during both fiscal years  resulting in lower professional fees 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from this increase was primarily a result of higher level of manufacturing development requirements related to additional clinical trial agreements the company entered into and grant related requirements during fiscal year lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from this reduction was primarily the result of lower levels of clinical trial participation during the year  partially offset by a slightly higher level of manufacturing development requirements for veltuzumab product for takeda nycomed 
expenses for outside testing were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from this increase was a result of increased material testing for process validation and offsite lyophilization relating to product development for manufacturing and grant program requirements during the fiscal expenses for outside testing were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from this increase was the result of increased testing for process validations and offsite lyophilization for product development 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to development based on spending levels increase by million  or  to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased spending in the product development area as compared to the research area  resulting in a higher proportion of indirect costs 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to development based on spending levels increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased employee related costs 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period years i ii iii the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient follow up in light of trial results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  immunomedics principal sources of funds have been the private and public sale of debt and equity securities and revenues from licensing  which provided up front and milestone payments  as well as funding of development costs and other licensing possibilities 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need to complete its pipeline of research and development programs  on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if the company were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the terms of any such debt or equity financing may include covenants which may limit our future ability to manage the business 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended june  the decrease in the current fiscal year s cash flow provided by operations is primarily due to the receipt of million attributable to the ucb amendment agreement in  offset in part by the million of proceeds from the arbitration settlement and million in insurance proceeds received during the current fiscal year 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million used in operations for fiscal the increase in cash flow provided by operations was primarily due to the receipt of million attributable to the ucb amendment agreement  offset in part by the milestone payments totaling million that were received from takeda nycomed in and the non recurring million received under the qtdp program in the fiscal year 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 
the decrease in cash flow from investing activities for the fiscal year is primarily due to million in proceeds received from an insurance claim in the current year 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year 
the decrease in cash flow from investing activities for the fiscal year is primarily due to the prior year s receipt of million from the proceeds from the sales and redemption of auction rate securities and million in proceeds from an insurance claim  which were not repeated in the fiscal year 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million  resulting primarily from the approximately million of cash proceeds received from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in the current fiscal period 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million  resulting primarily from the issuance of a warrant to acquire  shares of the company s common stock to ucb as part of the ucb amendment agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million  primarily resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
at june   we had working capital of million  representing an increase of million from the million in working capital that we had at june  the increase was primarily a result of the net proceeds of million received from the issuance of  shares of our common stock and the arbitration settlement of million  during the current fiscal year  offset in part by operating loss incurred in the normal course of business 
at june   we had working capital of million  representing an increase of million from the million in working capital that we had at june  this increase in working capital was primarily a result of the million net cash provided by operations 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at june  represented an increase of million from million at june  the increase for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the net proceeds received from the issuance of  shares of common stock  the arbitration settlement  and insurance proceeds during the current fiscal year offset in part by the operating loss incurred in the normal course of business 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at june  represented an increase of million from million at june  the increase for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the million in cash provided by operations and million in net cash flow from financing activities  principally the issuance of common stock purchase warrants to ucb 
other liquidity matters we have million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at june  based on our expected cash utilization rate  we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements in fiscal year are expected to increase to million  which includes expenses related to our adc programs and certain expenses to initiate our anticipated clivatuzumab phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer 
our phase ib clinical trial of clivatuzumab in patients with pancreatic cancer was completed during the fiscal year 
in fiscal  we plan to launch a phase iii clinical trial with y labeled clivatuzumab tetraxetan in combination with low dose gemcitabine as a therapy for pancreatic cancer patients with two or more prior treatments 
we will require additional funding in order to complete this phase iii clinical trial 
we plan to continue pursuing sources of financing including  potential payments from partners  including any cash payment that we might receive in connection with a sublicense involving a third party and ucb  which is not within our control  licensing arrangements  grants or other financing sources 
we expect research and development activities to continue to expand over time  and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to continue to conduct development of product candidates in line with our pipeline included in our long term corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to conduct our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
our ability to raise capital through public and private debt or equity financings may be negatively impacted by the current weak economy 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available when we need it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  our ability to continue our business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the terms of any such debt or equity financing may include covenants which may limit our future ability to manage the business 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources  when necessary  to fund our strategic priorities 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility and employment contracts in effect for our chairman of the board  chief medical officer and chief scientific officer and the president chief executive officer 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total operating lease employment contracts total the operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility expires in october and is at a base annual rental rate of million  which has a fixed rate through october with increases thereafter every five years 
included are amounts due under employment contracts with david m 
goldenberg  our chief medical officer and chief scientific officer  through and cynthia sullivan  our president and chief executive officer  through the five year employment contract with david m 
goldenberg was entered into effective july  this contract also included a minimum royalty agreement  a percentage of the consideration the company receives from licensing agreements  sales of intellectual properties and disposition of undeveloped assets  as disclosed in the employment agreement 
the amounts included above are only the minimum payments and do not include possible adjustments to existing salaries  additional incentive compensation or potential bonus payments as set forth in the employment contract 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu  comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
asu requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments  including changes in aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
the company will adopt asu in the first quarter of fiscal year  which will not have a significant impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
we have not entered into and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
one of our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on such instruments 
a one percent change basis points in interest rates on our investments would have impacted interest income by a nominal amount for the year ended june  we also may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies with regard to certain agreements with service providers relating to certain clinical trials that are in process 
depending on the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  realized and unrealized currency fluctuations could be significant
