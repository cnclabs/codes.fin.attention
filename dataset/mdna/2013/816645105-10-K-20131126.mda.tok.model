item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the risk factors contained in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  and other information provided from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell led chips and led components 
our products are used primarily for general lighting applications  including street lights and commercial  industrial and residential lighting 
our led chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications such as uv curing of polymers  led light therapy in medical cosmetic applications  counterfeit detection  led lighting for horticulture applications  and architectural lighting 
our core products are led chips and led components  but lighting products have also become an increasingly important part of our business 
we sell blue  green and uv led chips under our mvpled brand to a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets  including taiwan  the united states  russia and china 
we also sell our new ev led product series in blue  green and uv 
we sell our led chips to packagers or to distributors  who in turn sell to packagers 
in addition  we package a portion of our led chips into led components  which we sell to distributors and end customers in selected markets 
our lighting products customers consist primarily of odms of lighting products and the end users of lighting devices 
we also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain led products  and for certain aspects of our product fabrication  assembly and packaging processes  based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process 
we are a holding company for various wholly and majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures 
our most significant subsidiary is our wholly owned operating subsidiary  taiwan semileds  where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located  where a substantial portion of our research  development  manufacturing  marketing and sales activities take place  and where most of our employees are based 
as of august   we also owned a interest in ning xiang  which consisted of a interest that we acquired in august and an additional interest that we acquired in april in november  we acquired an additional interest in ning xiang  which increased our total ownership interest to 
ning xiang is engaged in the design  manufacture and sales of lighting fixtures and systems 
we also have interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that we have accounted for as equity method investments and as such have not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
as of august   we owned a interest in silq  a joint venture established in malaysia to design  manufacture and sell lighting fixtures and systems 
we expect that this business will incur losses for the near term 
as of august   we also owned a equity ownership interest in china semileds  which was formed to engage in the manufacture and sale of led chips in china 
china semileds was 
table of contents originally significant to our china strategy  but we wrote down the investment to a carrying amount of zero at august   as a result of our proportionate share of the net loss and impairment charge reported by china semileds for the year ended august  because we have no obligation or intention to provide additional funding to china semileds  we have suspended using the equity method of accounting and no longer recognize any portion of the net losses reported by china semileds subsequent to august  we will resume accounting for the investment using the equity method if china semileds subsequently returns to profitability and our share of future income is sufficient to recover our share of the cumulative losses that have not previously been recognized during the period the equity method of accounting is suspended 
the shareholders of china semileds have been working towards formulating certain restructuring plans since late calendar year to allow china semileds to recommence operations 
even if a restructuring can be effected  there can be no assurance that the restructuring would be successful  and therefore  particularly if the banks seize china semileds assets  liquidation of china semileds may be required 
we may not be able to recover anything from our investment 
key factors affecting our financial condition  results of operations and business the following are key factors that we believe affect our financial condition  results of operations and business industry growth and demand for products and applications using leds 
the overall adoption of led lighting devices to replace traditional lighting sources is expected to influence the growth and demand for led chips and impact our financial performance 
we believe the potential market for led lighting will continue to expand 
leds for efficient generation of uv light are also starting to gain attention for various medical  germicidal and industrial applications 
since a substantial portion of our led chips  led components and our lighting products are used by end users in general lighting applications and specialty industrial applications such as uv curing  medical cosmetic  counterfeit detection and horticulture  the adoption of leds into these applications will have a strong impact on the demand of led chips generally and  as a result  for our led chips  led components and led lighting products 
fluctuations in demand for led lights products will also affect the results of ning xiang 
average selling price of our products 
the average selling price of our products may decline for a variety of factors  including prices charged by our competitors  the efficacy of our products  our cost basis  changes in our product mix  the size of the order and our relationship with the relevant customer  as well as general market and economic conditions 
competition in the markets for led products is intense  and we expect that competition will continue to increase  thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment 
for example  some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices  and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices  accelerating the decline in our revenues and the gross margin of our products 
when prices decline  we must also write down the value of our inventory 
furthermore  the average selling prices for our led products have typically decreased over product life cycles 
therefore  our ability to continue to innovate and offer competitive products that meet our customers specifications and pricing requirements  such as higher efficacy led products at lower costs  will have a material influence on our ability to improve our revenues and product margins  although in the near term the introduction of such higher efficacy led chips may further reduce the selling prices of our existing products or render them obsolete 
reduction in the average selling price of led lights products will also affect the results of ning xiang 
changes in our product mix 
we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell and the utilization of our manufacturing capacity in any given period  among other things 
for example  in fiscal  we placed greater 
table of contents emphasis on the sales of led components rather than the sales of led chip where we have been forced to cut prices on older inventory 
in particular  we sold a significant volume of a category of lower priced led components designed to meet our customers demand 
while such a shift in product mix to lower priced products lowered our average selling price  the significant sales volume helped to improve revenues and gross margin in fiscal we intend to continue to pursue opportunities for profitable growth in areas of business where we see the best opportunity for our new ev led product series of led chips particularly the uv market and continue to expand the lower priced led components as appropriate 
however  as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices  a change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may increase volatility in our revenues and gross margin from period to period 
our ability to reduce cost to offset lower average prices 
competitors may reduce average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs  and competitive pricing pressures may accelerate the rate of decline of our average selling prices 
to address increased pricing pressure  we have invested in the development of larger wafer sizes  in particular using wafers  which we believe should lower our production costs 
we have substantially converted our manufacturing of led chips based on wafer technology 
we have also improved and increased our production yields to reduce the per unit cost of production for our products 
however  such cost savings currently have limited impact on our gross profit  as we suffered from the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity  primarily for our led chips  starting in the fourth quarter of our fiscal and continuing through the fourth quarter of our fiscal  and must absorb a high level of fixed cost  such as depreciation 
while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses  over the long term we expect to be required to invest substantially in led development and production equipment if we are to grow 
our ability to continue to innovate 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to be innovative in product design  to deliver new products and to improve our manufacturing efficiencies 
our continued success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new  technologically advanced and lower cost products  such as more efficient  higher brightness led chips 
if we are unable to introduce new products that are commercially viable and meet rapidly evolving customer requirements or keep pace with evolving technological standards and market developments or are otherwise unable to execute our product innovation strategy effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise  execute our business plan or be able to compete effectively 
during the fourth quarter of our fiscal  we introduced our new ev led product series  capable of operating at a higher junction temperature and with higher thermal endurance  as well as our new ceramic led component products  the c emitters  that incorporates the ev chip and also offers customers greater flexibility in making color choices 
in june  we expanded our uv led product portfolio with the launch of mid and high power product series designed for industrial applications such as printing  coating  curing  signage and medical cosmetic uses 
we also broadened our led components portfolio through an acquisition in july our near term success will depend upon how attractive these products are to our customers versus competitors offerings and our customers willingness and promptness in qualifying our new products 
general economic conditions and geographic concentration 
many countries including the united states and the european union members have instituted  or have announced plans to institute  government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting 
these actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting  which are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds 
the global financial crisis that began in late caused extreme disruption in the financial markets 
although the disruption in the financial 
table of contents markets moderated thereafter  the global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained economic recovery 
when the global economy slows or a financial crisis occurs  consumer and government confidence declines  with levels of government grants and subsidies for led adoption and consumer spending likely to be adversely impacted 
our revenues have been concentrated in a few select markets  including taiwan  the united states  russia and china 
given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry  our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
therefore  our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets 
for example  some of our customers in russia have experienced temporary liquidity constraints as a result of the impact of the banking crisis in cyprus in march on the russian economy  which have led to reduced and or delayed purchases of our products by these customers 
in addition  we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
some of our largest customers and what we produce have produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete  large project based purchases and broadening customer base  among other things 
for the years ended august  and  sales to our three largest customers  in the aggregate  accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
intellectual property issues 
competitors of ours and other third parties have in the past and will likely from time to time in the future allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture  use or sell products found to be infringing 
in june  we settled an intellectual property dispute involving cree 
we agreed to dismiss amended complaints filed against each other without prejudice 
we agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction that was effective october  that precludes us from and or from assisting others in making  using  importing  selling and or offering to sell in the united states certain accused products and or any device that includes such an accused product after that date and to payment of a settlement fee for past damages 
all accused products sold before the date of settlement are released under this agreement and our customers and distributors are specifically released 
all remaining claims between cree and us were withdrawn without prejudice  with each retaining the right to assert them in the future 
however  other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products  or our customers products that incorporate our technologies or products 
any such legal action or the threat of legal action against us  or our customers  could impair such customers continued demand for our products 
this could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues  or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses  and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to realize our strategic initiatives 
we have grown our business in part through strategic alliances and acquisitions 
for example  our china strategy was initially premised on continuing our growth in china through china semileds 
the launch of china semileds was not successful  see business our joint ventures and investments china semileds 
we now no longer view china semileds as the vehicle to drive our growth in china 
as the world second largest economy and one that is geographically close to our manufacturing operations  china continues to represent a key market for our products and we have been working towards formulating certain strategic alternatives to exploit the opportunities that it presents  including  but not limited to  developing and expanding our direct sales force and distribution channels through local third party distributors 
in addition  we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including product  technology  business or asset transactions  such as acquisitions or divestitures 
for example  in july  we acquired an led components production line and related technology from certain third parties  and we believe this acquisition 
table of contents should allow us to expand our production capacity for led components  and strengthen our product portfolio  technology and know how related to led components 
components of consolidated statements of operations revenues  net our core products are led chips and led components  but lighting products have also become an increasingly important part of our business 
our revenues are affected by sales volumes of our led chips  led components and lighting products and our average selling prices for such products 
in addition  as we expand and diversify our product offerings and with varying average selling prices  any change in the mix of products that we sell in any given period may affect our total revenues 
for example  average selling prices for our led components are generally higher than for led chips and the average selling prices for our lighting products are higher than for our led chips and led components 
we recognize revenue on sales of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  ownership and risk of loss has transferred and collection of the sales proceeds is probable 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers as evidence of an arrangement and these authorizations generally provide for a specified amount of product at a fixed price 
we typically consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment  unless otherwise agreed in the applicable sales terms  as this is generally when title and risk of loss for the product passes to the customer 
our larger customers typically provide us with non binding rolling forecasts of their requirements for the coming one to three months  however  recent global economic uncertainty and weakness has led to reduced spending in our target markets and made it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
our customers may increase  decrease  cancel or delay purchase orders already in place  with no material consequences to the customer 
as a result  we may face increased inventories and our backlog may decline as a result of any economic downturn or material change in market conditions or economic outlook 
we price our products in accordance with prevailing market conditions  taking into account the technical specifications of the product being sold  the order volume  the strength and history of our relationship with the customer  our inventory levels and our capacity utilization 
when average selling prices drop  as they did in the years ended august  and  inventory write downs to net realizable values may also result 
our customers for led chips consist of both packagers and distributors who sell our led chips to their packaging customers 
packagers in turn sell their packaged led components to end users of lighting devices 
our customers for led components consist primarily of distributors and end customers in selected markets 
our lighting products customers consist primarily of odms of lighting products and the end users of these lighting devices 
distributors accounted for and of our revenues for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our revenues attributable to our ten largest customers accounted for and of our revenues for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our revenues are concentrated in a few select markets  including taiwan  the united states  russia and china 
net revenues generated from sales to countries in these markets  in the aggregate  represented and of our revenues for the years ended august  and  respectively 
we expect that our revenues will continue to be substantially derived from these countries for the foreseeable future 
given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry  our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
therefore  our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in such markets 

table of contents our revenues are presented net of estimated sales returns and discounts 
we estimate sales returns and discounts based on our historical discounts and return rates and our assessment of future conditions 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists primarily of cost of materials  depreciation expenses  manufacturing overhead costs  direct labor costs and utilities cost  all related to the manufacture of our led products 
materials include raw materials  other materials such as gases and chemicals  consumables  and assembly materials 
because our products are manufactured based on customers orders and specifications and we purchase materials and supplies to support such orders  we generally purchase our materials at spot prices in the marketplace and do not maintain long term supply contracts 
we purchase materials from several suppliers 
our procurement policy is to select only a small number of qualified vendors who demonstrate quality of materials and reliability on delivery time 
we are subject to variations in the cost of our materials and consumables from period to period 
moreover  because we consume a significant amount of electricity in our manufacturing process  any fluctuations in electricity costs will have an impact on our cost of revenues 
we also use contract manufacturers to produce for our sale certain led products  and for certain aspects of our product fabrication  assembly and packaging processes  based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process 
direct labor costs consist of salary including stock based compensation  bonus  training  retirement and other costs related to our employees engaged in the manufacture of our products 
manufacturing overhead costs consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our administrative personnel allocated to manufacturing functions  repairs and maintenance costs for equipment and machinery maintenance costs and lease expenses 
our cost of revenues also includes excess capacity charges as a result of the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and inventory valuation adjustments to write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable values as a result of declines in their average selling prices 
operating expenses research and development 
our research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of expenses related to employee salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our research and development personnel  engineering charges related to product design  purchases of materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance and depreciation related expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and other benefits including stock based compensation expenses for our administrative  sales and marketing personnel  expenses for professional services  which include fees and expenses for accounting  legal  tax and valuation services  amortization and depreciation related expenses  marketing related travel  lease expenses  entertainment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts and general office related expenses  as well as compensation to our directors 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease as we continue to implement cost reduction initiatives  such as spending controls  and as we continue to streamline our operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
we recognized impairment charges on our long lived assets  which consisted of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  for the years ended august  and the impairment charges on property  plant and equipment were primarily related to machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of led epitaxial wafers and chips 
during the year ended august   we also recognized an impairment charge on the intangible asset for 
table of contents customer relationships that arose from our acquisition of a equity interest in ning xiang in august goodwill impairment 
during the year ended august   we recognized an impairment charge on goodwill that arose from our acquisition of a equity interest in ning xiang in august provision for litigation settlement 
we recognized a provision and cash payment for litigation settlement for the year ended august  associated with the cree litigation 
other income expense impairment loss on investment 
during the year ended august   we recognized an impairment loss on our investment in hpo  an equity investment we account for using the cost method  as a result of an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in hpo 
equity in losses from unconsolidated entities  net 
loss from unconsolidated entities consists of our portion of the income or losses of silq  and for the year ended august   also the loss from china semileds  which we no longer recognize subsequent to august   and ss optoelectronics  which was dissolved in september these entities have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and as such  we generally recognize our portion of the net income or loss from such entities in our consolidated statements of operations 
we report our investment in such entities as investments in unconsolidated entities on our consolidated balance sheets and such investment amounts are initially stated at cost  and subsequently adjusted for our portion of equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
if the value of our investment in such entities declines  and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment would be written down to fair value 
as of august   the carrying amount of our investment in china semileds had been reduced to zero
