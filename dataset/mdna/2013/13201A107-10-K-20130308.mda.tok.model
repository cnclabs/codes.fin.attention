item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  
table of contents organization of information management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the following sections overview results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  liquidity and capital resources non gaap measures capital expenditures and outlook commitments and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates recently issued financial accounting standards overview on december   we completed the business combination of cambium and vlcy as contemplated by the agreement and plan of mergers  dated as of june   among us  vlcy  vowel acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  cambium  a wholly owned subsidiary of vss cambium holdings iii  llc  consonant acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  and vowel representative  llc  solely in its capacity as stockholders representative 
we refer to this agreement and plan of mergers in this report as the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we acquired all of the common stock of each of cambium and vlcy through the merger of consonant acquisition corp 
with and into cambium  with cambium continuing as the surviving corporation the cambium merger  and the concurrent merger of vowel acquisition corp 
with and into vlcy  with vlcy continuing as the surviving corporation the voyager merger 
as a result of the effectiveness of the mergers  cambium and vlcy became our wholly owned subsidiaries 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of vlcy s common stock was converted in the voyager merger into the right to receive at the election of each stockholder  either i in cash  without interest  or ii one share of our common stock  plus  regardless of the election made  additional consideration consisting of cash and a contingent value right  as described in the merger agreement 
the amount of cash available to satisfy cash elections by the vlcy stockholders was limited to million in the aggregate 
the cash consideration payable to the former vlcy stockholders was insufficient to accommodate all of the cash elections that were made 
accordingly  the amount of cash paid to the former vlcy stockholders who elected to exchange shares of vlcy common stock for cash was reduced  pro rata  in accordance with agreed procedures set forth in the merger agreement 
pursuant to these procedures  we paid million in cash to the former holders of vlcy s common stock and issued to those stockholders a total of million shares of common stock 
the cash consideration paid to the former vlcy stockholders consisted of million contributed by vss cambium holdings iii  llc and million contributed by vlcy 
in exchange for its contribution of million  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received million shares of our common stock issued at the ascribed value of per share 
the shares of cambium s common stock held by vss cambium holdings iii  llc  its sole stockholder  were converted in the cambium merger into the right to receive million shares of our common stock 
in addition  as part of the merger consideration  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock determined by a 
table of contents formula set forth in the merger agreement  which is currently equal to  shares 
in connection with the consummation of this transaction  we entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which we granted vss cambium holdings iii  llc and funds managed and controlled by vss the right to purchase up to million shares of our common stock as provided for in the stockholders agreement as well as certain preemptive rights set forth therein 
in august  vss cambium holdings iii  llc  exercised its subscription rights in full to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  or an aggregate purchase price of million 
the merger transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of vlcy by cambium  as that term is used under gaap  for accounting and financial reporting purposes under the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations 
in making this determination  management considered that a the newly developed entity did not have any significant pre combination activity and  therefore  did not qualify to be the accounting acquirer  and b the former sole stockholder of cambium is the majority holder of the combined entity  while the prior owners of vlcy became minority holders in the combined entity 
as a result  the historical financial statements of cambium have become the historical financial statements of the company 
the results of vlcy are included in the company s operations beginning with the december  merger date  therefore  the financials include vlcy for the last days of that year and the results of the company for the full year 
we operate as two reportable segments with separate management teams and infrastructures that offer various products and services  as follows vsl  which provides educators with results based products  services and learning solutions that improve school and student performance in literacy and math  and clt  which creates software and hardware products that serve students from pre k through adult and enable the educators who help them learn 
unallocated shared services  such as accounting  legal  human resources and corporate related items  are recorded in a shared services category 
depreciation and amortization expense  interest income and expense  other income and expense  goodwill impairments  and taxes are included in this shared services category 
in and  we reported separate segment results for voyager learning  a comprehensive intervention business  and sopris learning  a supplemental solutions education business 
in late  the management teams and infrastructures for these operations were merged into our combined vsl business unit 
our historical segment reporting results have been combined for comparative purposes to reflect the current organizational structure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our reportable segments 
results of operations highlights fiscal year constraints on federal and state funding to our school district customers continued to pose challenges to our performance in fiscal year during the first three quarters of  order volumes declined versus this is in large part attributable to the expiration of the arra funding in september we expect governmental spending austerity to continue and have a depressive effect on general education spending and  therefore  make order volume growth challenging 
however  the fourth quarter order volumes were better than the fourth quarter  indicating that there could be stabilization of order volume declines when considering a more comparative funding environment 
the decline in overall order volumes were partially offset by growth in the clt segment s learning a z and explorelearning product lines and in our service offerings within the vsl segment led by the school turnaround product line 
these pockets of growth are promising  and we believe that we will continue to see growth in services and technology offerings 

table of contents in order to align our organization to our strategic goals and to provide savings as a means to fund our strategic initiatives  we completed a series of reengineering and restructuring initiatives starting in late and continuing throughout reengineering and restructuring activities included obtaining new leadership and employee skill sets that support our transformation to focus more heavily on technology solutions and services and other strategic objectives  outsourcing warehouse operations to a third party logistics provider  which will allow us to take advantage of a lower and more variable cost structure for our print based products  as well as locate operations closer to the geographic center of our nationwide customer base  rationalizing facilities space by consolidating facilities and subleasing entire or partial facilities where feasible  assessing and implementing optimization projects to improve cost efficiencies and enhance the customer experience throughout the order to cash  professional service delivery  procurement processes  and sales channel structure  reduction of job positions that do not support the company s key strategic goals  and other reductions and costs to improve our cost structure 
the total expense for all reengineering and restructuring initiatives from the fourth quarter of through the end of was million  including both cash and non cash items  and capital expenditures were million 
we realized approximately million in savings in from these activities 
the reengineering and restructuring activities are expected to yield cumulative savings in of approximately million relative to spending levels 
the company further expects to continue on this path to ultimately secure cumulative annualized savings of million  a part of which is intended to be reinvested in critical growth areas 
the clt segment is considered one of our critical growth areas  particularly the learning a z and explorelearning product lines within that segment 
as such  to foster growth in  we increased clt segment expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing 
our spending for the vsl segment in was held relatively flat with levels  excluding the reengineering and restructuring initiatives and volume driven costs such as cost of goods sold and sales commissions 
given the order volume declines within the vsl segment  we plan to reduce spending in reengineering and restructuring activities  cost reduction actions taken at the end of and the recent merger of the voyager learning and sopris learning segments will provide the expected cost savings 
reductions in spending are expected in cost of revenues  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense  and general and administrative expense 
during  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million  with vsl segment goodwill written down by million and goodwill related to the kurzweil educational systems and intellitools product lines in the clt segment written down by million 
the goodwill impairment was the result of a decline in order volumes and a reduction in our estimates of future cash flows primarily impacted by expected continued funding pressure 
these same triggering factors resulted in impairment charges of million related to vsl segment s intangible assets including acquired curriculum and technology intangibles  acquired publishing rights and other intangible assets 
fiscal year in fiscal year  we experienced overall order volume declines driven by the vsl segment  partially offset by order volume growth in the clt segment 
the adverse education funding environment impacted our intervention products in particular 
the company believes that results were also adversely impacted by certain internal factors  such as decreased focus on the customer experience  an over reliance on the field sales force versus utilizing multiple channels of sales and marketing  and delays in strategic decision making 

table of contents the vsl segment experienced growth in the first half of  which we believe was at least partially attributable to some positive impact  both directly and indirectly  from arra funding and also due to growth in our service offerings 
however  the educational funding environment remained challenging and order volumes gained in the first half of the year were lost during the third quarter 
order volumes declined even further in the fourth quarter as most of the arra funding expired in september and several large multi year transactions completed in the fourth quarter of could not be replicated in in october we completed the acquisition of class 
com 
class 
com provides high quality  research proven  online instruction  supplemental education  and intervention programs online and through its fully accredited high school  lincoln national academy 
our clt segment had another year of order volume growth  as the market acceptance for technology based solutions has been robust and appears less impacted by funding issues 
clt growth was also fueled by investments made in prior years for product development  sales and marketing 
within the clt segment we continued to experience significant growth in our two online offerings  explorelearning and learning a z 
this growth was partially offset by declines in the kurzweil and intellitools product lines 
expenses in benefitted from our cost savings initiatives 
we continued to pursue cost savings and productivity initiatives in  although not to the same extent as in  and we redeployed these savings into growth investments 
investments in were focused on our digital assets  including our student data management system  our online subscription products  new online adaptive solutions  and online intervention programs for math and literacy 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges in of million related to our vsl segment and million related to the kurzweil educational systems and intellitools product lines in our clt segment 
the goodwill impairment charges were primarily the result of the declines in order volumes and the expected near term impact of continued funding pressures on these two reporting units

we determined during the second quarter of that the goodwill balance for the reporting unit comprising the kurzweil and intellitools product lines from the clt segment was partially impaired 
as such an impairment charge of million was recorded 
the goodwill impairment charge was primarily the result of lowered forecasts of future sales for that reporting unit

order volumes for the vsl segment declined in and  and our estimates of future cash flows were impacted by expected continued funding pressure 
the decline in supplemental funding sources that school districts use to purchase our products has resulted in significant reductions to curriculum and programs for struggling students

liquidity and capital resources because sales seasonality affects operating cash flow  we normally incur a net cash deficit from all of our activities through the early part of the third quarter of the year 
we typically fund these seasonal deficits through the drawdown of cash  supplemented by borrowings on a revolving credit facility  if needed 
the cash balance as of december  was million 
the primary sources of liquidity are our current cash balances and our annual cash flow from operations and the primary liquidity requirements relate to interest on our long term debt  pre publication costs  capital investments and working capital 
we believe that based on current and anticipated levels of operating performance  cash flow from operations and availability under a revolving credit facility  we will be able to make required interest payments on our debt and fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
although we have excess cash balances  we will be more targeted in making planned internal investments and executing on selected acquisition targets due to the downturn in our business environment 
should the company be unsuccessful over time in reversing the downward sales volume trend experienced in and  we believe the company s historic trend of providing surplus cash each year would be at risk absent additional cost reductions in non critical areas

table of contents non gaap measures the net loss as reported on a gaap basis includes material non operational and non cash items 
we believe that earnings loss from operations before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and adjusted ebitda  which further excludes non operational and non cash items  provide useful information for investors to assess the results of the ongoing business of the company 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net revenues are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly named  non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the company and provide investors with a view of the company s operations from management s perspective 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net revenues remove significant purchase accounting  non operational or certain non cash items from earnings 
we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted net revenues to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the company and as the basis to set and measure progress towards performance targets  which directly affect compensation for employees and executives 
we generally use these non gaap measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of liquidity 
our presentation of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net revenues should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual  non operational or non cash items

table of contents a under applicable accounting guidance for business combinations  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value 
net revenues have been reduced by million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and in the historical financial statements due to the write down of deferred revenue to its estimated fair value as of the merger date 
the write down was determined by estimating the cost to fulfill the related future customer obligations plus a normal profit margin 
partially offsetting this impact  cost of revenues were reduced for other purchase accounting adjustments  primarily a write down of deferred costs to zero at the acquisition date 
during the years ended december  and  the historical cost of revenues was reduced by million and million  respectively 
the adjustment of deferred revenue and deferred costs to fair value is required only at the purchase accounting date  therefore  its impact on net revenues and cost of revenues is non recurring 
b in late  we launched a reengineering and restructuring initiative to align our organizational and cost structure to our strategic goals 
the financial goal of these actions is to provide savings to both improve earnings and to fund re investment in growth areas of the business 
during the year ended december   we recorded reengineering and restructuring charges of million  including impairment charges of million related to our leased facility in frederick  colorado and warehouse related assets and previously capitalized amounts that were determined to have no ongoing value 
million of reengineering and restructuring charges were incurred in c costs are related to merger and acquisition activities including due diligence and other non operational charges such as pension and severance costs for former employees

revenue recognition 
voyager sopris learning revenues for our vsl segment are derived from sales of literacy and math educational solutions to school districts 
sales include printed materials  interactive web based programs and online educational content  courseware  training and implementation services  school improvement and turnaround services  and professional development 
revenue from the sale of printed materials is recognized when the product is shipped to or received by the customer  depending on the shipping terms of the arrangement 
revenue for interactive web based programs and online educational content  which may be sold separately or included with printed curriculum materials  courseware and school improvement and turnaround services are recognized ratably over the subscription or contractual period  typically a school year 
professional services such as training  implementation and professional development are recognized over the period services are delivered 
the division of revenue between printed materials  materials and programs accessed online  and ongoing support and services is determined in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this guidance  we are required to allocate revenue among the deliverables in an arrangement using the relative selling price method 
the guidance requires use of a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of each deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 

table of contents we are not able to establish vsoe for each deliverable 
whenever vsoe cannot be established  we review the offerings of competitors to determine whether tpe can be established 
tpe is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately 
it may be difficult to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate tpe and therefore we may not always be able to use tpe 
we also use besp to determine the selling price of certain deliverables  primarily for certain printed materials which have historically been priced on a bundled basis with related online materials 
the determination of besp considers the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts or services  and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we analyze the selling prices used in the allocation of arrangement consideration at least annually 
selling prices are analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in the business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in selling prices 
we enter into agreements to license or sell certain publishing rights and content 
we recognize the revenue from these agreements when the license amount is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and when either the license period  if applicable  has commenced or transfer of content  if applicable  has occurred 
shipments to school book depositories are on consignment and revenue is recognized based on shipments from the depositories to the schools 
cambium learning technologies revenues for our clt segment are derived from technology products and services that serve students and educators 
the explorelearning and learning a z product lines derive revenue exclusively from sales of online subscriptions to their reading  math and science teaching websites and related training and professional development 
the kurzweil educational systems and intellitools product lines derive revenue from either an online subscription or from the delivery of software or hardware 
typically  the clt subscriptions are for a twelve to twenty four month period and the revenue is recognized ratably over the period the online access is available to the customer 
any training or professional development related to an online subscription is recognized over the same period of online access 
software and hardware sales are recognized when shipped or provided to customers 
maintenance and support services for our software can include telephone support  bug fixes  and  for certain products  rights to upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
on line services include access to digital content including literacy tools  cloud storage and the ability to individualize assignments 
these services are recognized on a straight line basis over the period they are provided 
in certain instances  telephone support and software repairs are provided for free within the first three months of licensing the software 
the cost of providing this service is insignificant  and is accrued at the time of revenue recognition 
impairment of goodwill 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually and if a triggering event is determined to have occurred in an interim period 
prior to  our annual analysis was performed as of december for the fiscal year ending december   we changed our method of applying the applicable guidance such that the annual goodwill impairment testing date will be changed from december to october this change did not result in any delay  acceleration or avoidance of impairment 
we believe this change will be preferable as it better aligns the impairment test with our close procedures and allows additional time to accurately complete our impairment testing process in order to incorporate the results in our annual financial statements and timely file those statements with the sec 
the change was applied prospectively beginning on october   retrospective application to prior periods was impracticable as we were unable to objectively determine  without the use of hindsight  the assumptions that would have been used in those earlier periods 
in september  new guidance was issued regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the 
table of contents revised standard in in conjunction with its annual impairment testing date 
for the two step quantitative impairment test  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit  then a second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting entity s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature  and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
we performed our goodwill impairment reviews in using four reporting units voyager learning  sopris learning  the learning a z and explorelearning product lines from the clt segment  and the kurzweil and intellitools product lines from the clt segment 
in and  we reported segment results separately for voyager learning  a comprehensive intervention business  and sopris learning  a supplemental solutions education business 
in late  the management teams and infrastructures for these operations were merged into our combined vsl business unit 
the historical segment reporting results have been combined for comparative purposes to reflect the current organizational structure 
as the annual goodwill impairment testing date was prior to the combination of these segments  voyager learning and sopris learning were each considered a reporting unit for goodwill testing purposes 
the following table details the goodwill balances at december  by reporting unit goodwill balance as of december  voyager learning sopris learning learning a z explorelearning kurzweil intellitools total when performing the two step quantitative impairment test for all periods presented  we first determined the fair market value of each reporting unit to be tested using a weighted income and market approach 
the income approach was dependent on multiple assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow projections with a terminal value multiple and the discount rate used to determine the expected present value of the estimated future cash flows 
future cash flow projections were based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  capital and other expenditures  and tax rates 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows was a weighted average cost of capital and took into consideration market and industry conditions  returns for comparable companies  the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn  and other relevant factors 
the fair values of each reporting unit also took into consideration a market approach  based on historical and projected multiples of certain guideline companies 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit for the first step of the impairment test  then a second step was performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting entity s goodwill 
the second step of the impairment test requires the allocation of the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded 

table of contents interim impairment analysis during the quarter ended june   significant sustained sales declines in kurzweil intellitools caused us to re evaluate the forecasts for this reporting unit 
we determined that future sales for kurzweil intellitools were not expected to achieve previous forecasts 
this adverse change in expected future cash flows triggered the need for an interim goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit 
the first step of impairment testing as of june  concluded that the carrying value of the kurzweil intellitools reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the second step of testing was required 
as a result of the second step of our interim impairment test  the goodwill balance for the kurzweil intellitools reporting unit was determined to be partially impaired  and an impairment charge of million was recorded as of june  the goodwill impairment charge was primarily the result of lowered forecasts of future sales 
annual impairment analysis for the annual impairment analysis  we elected to perform the optional qualitative assessment on the learning a z explorelearning reporting unit 
the qualitative assessment did not result in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired and  therefore  it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for the learning a z explorelearning reporting unit 
for the voyager learning  sopris learning and kurzweil intellitools reporting units  we performed the quantitative two step impairment test 
the first step of the fiscal impairment test showed that the carrying value of the voyager learning reporting unit exceeded its fair value and that the second step of testing was required 
the calculated fair values of the sopris learning and kurzweil intellitools reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least  therefore  no second step of testing was required 
as a result of the second step of our fiscal impairment test  the goodwill balance for the voyager learning reporting unit was determined to be partially impaired  and an impairment charge of million was recorded as of october  order volumes for the voyager learning reporting unit declined in and  and our estimates of future cash flows were impacted by expected continued funding pressure 
the decline in supplemental funding sources that school districts use to purchase our products has resulted in significant reductions to curriculum and programs for struggling students 
we do not expect federal funding to improve in the near term and  as a result  customer retention and sales growth may be challenging 
although we have included our best estimates of the impact of these and other factors in our cash flow projections  the projection of future cash flows is inherently uncertain and requires a significant amount of judgment 
actual results that are significantly different than these cash flow projections or a change in the discount rate could significantly affect the fair value estimates used to value our reporting units in step one of the goodwill analysis or the fair values of our other asset and liability balances used in step two of the goodwill analysis  and could result in future goodwill impairments 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate net book value may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if our review indicates any assets are impaired  the impairment of those assets is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
for fiscal year  we recorded total impairment of long lived asset charges of million  including million of acquired intangible assets as a result of adverse business developments in the voyager learning reporting unit million related to our reengineering and restructuring initiatives  as there was an expected decline in the pattern of usage of the related assets due to our warehouse outsourcing and other process reengineering activities million of pre publication costs related to expenditures capitalized as pre publication costs in for a project that was subsequently abandoned 
table of contents the voyager learning reporting unit s decline in order volume and impact of expected continued funding pressure on our estimates of future cash flows that resulted in goodwill impairment were also considered triggering events to review the recoverability of the definite lived intangible assets associated with that unit 
after determining that certain intangible assets would not be recovered with future undiscounted cash flows  we calculated an impairment loss for these assets equal to the excess of their carrying values over their fair values using the same date as the annual goodwill impairment analysis  october  fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and were dependent on multiple assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow projections  the discount rate used to determine the expected present value of the estimated future cash flows  the percentage of the future revenues and cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets  asset lives used to generate future cash flows  and royalty charges attributable to trademarks 
the future cash flow projections used in the definite lived impairment analyses were based on our best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  capital and other expenditures  and tax rates 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows was a weighted average cost of capital and took into consideration market and industry conditions  returns for comparable companies  the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn  and other relevant factors 
pre publication costs 
we capitalize certain pre publication costs of our curriculum  including art  prepress  editorial  and other costs incurred in the creation of the master copy of our curriculum products 
pre publication costs are amortized over the expected life of the education program  generally on an accelerated basis over a period of five years 
the amortization methods and periods chosen reflect the expected revenues generated by the education programs 
we periodically review the recoverability of the capitalized costs based on expected net realizable value 
as noted above  we recorded impairment charges of million related to expenditures capitalized as pre publication costs in for a project that was subsequently abandoned 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of the outstanding balances and historical collection experience 
the reserve for sales returns is based on historical rates of returns as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns to differ from historical experience 
actual bad debt write offs and returns could differ from our estimates 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market  and consists of finished goods 
we reduce slow moving or obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
inventory values are maintained at an amount that management considers appropriate based on factors such as the inventory aging  historical usage of the product  future sales forecasts  and product development plans 
these factors involve management s judgment and changes in estimates could result in increases or decreases to the inventory values 
the impact of a one percentage point change in the amount of inventory considered to be excess or obsolete would have resulted in an increase or decrease in cost of revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  inventory values are reviewed on a periodic basis 
income taxes 
provision is made for the expense  or benefit  associated with taxes based on income 
the provision for income taxes is based on laws currently enacted in every jurisdiction in which we do business and considers laws mitigating the taxation of the same income by more than one jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax expense  current tax receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in prior carryback years  loss carryforward limitations  and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
if  after consideration of these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 

table of contents we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate these amounts  since this requires management to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis  based on factors such as changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
contingent value rights cvrs 
cvrs were issued to vlcy stockholders as part of the merger 
each cvr represents the right to receive a cash amount equal to the sum of the following amounts minus specified agreed upon liabilities  including agreed contingencies  potential working capital adjustments and expenses of the stockholders representative under the merger agreement specified vlcy tax refunds received after the effective time of the merger  plus the lesser of million or the amount of specified post signing tax refunds of vlcy received after the date of the merger agreement and on or prior to the date of the closing  which was million  plus a portion of funds held for a potential tax indemnity obligation  if such obligation is not paid to its beneficiary  plus other amounts specified in the escrow agreement  the fair value of the liability for the cvrs is determined using a probability weighted cash flow analysis which takes into consideration the likelihood  amount and timing of cash flows of each element of the pool of assets and liabilities included in the cvr 
the determination of fair value of the cvrs involves significant assumptions and estimates  which are reviewed at each quarterly reporting date 
as of december   a fair value of million has been recorded as a liability for the remaining cvr payments  which is equal to the maximum cash payout at this date 
restricted assets in an escrow account for the benefit of the cvrs were million at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the cvrs and related escrow trust 
the first and second cvr payment dates were in september and june  with million and million  respectively  distributed to the escrow agent at those times for distribution to holders of the cvrs 
the remaining potential amounts to be distributed under the cvr include funds related to a potential tax indemnity obligation and refunds related to the michigan tax payment 
we do not expect any significant future changes in the estimate of the cvrs and expect to make the final distribution no later than october see note for further information on the michigan tax matter 
other contingencies 
other contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the value can be reasonably estimated 
we had a potential contingent liability related to state income taxes and related interest that had been assessed against a former subsidiary 
on august   the former subsidiary received a decision and order of determination from the michigan taxing authority 
according to the determination of the michigan taxing authority  the former subsidiary was liable to the state of michigan for unpaid taxes and interest in the amount of approximately million 
in order to expedite resolution of this matter and access the michigan court of claims  we paid this liability to the state of michigan on behalf of the former subsidiary on september  and filed an action in the michigan court of claims to pursue a refund of the assessment 
on november   the court of claims in michigan ruled in favor of our motion for summary judgment 
the michigan state taxing authority then appealed the decision of the court of claims to the michigan court of appeals 
on january   the michigan court of appeals affirmed the verdict of the court of claims 
as the michigan state taxing authority declined to appeal the case to the supreme court in michigan  we expect to receive the 
table of contents refund  plus statutory interest  in the second quarter of as such  the tax receivable of million as of december  equal to the expected refund plus statutory interest is now classified as a current asset and is recorded in tax receivables on the consolidated balance sheets 
the tax receivable balance as of december  of million is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
this liability was identified as an agreed contingency for purposes of the cvrs issued as part of a merger 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  dated june   fifty percent of any amount that is paid or due and payable with respect to each agreed contingency would offset payments due under the cvrs from an amount held for such payments by wells fargo bank  na  as escrow agent  in an escrow account 
upon payment of the approximately million  we requested a disbursement to the company from the escrow account in an amount equal to fifty percent of the payment  or approximately million 
this cash disbursement was received by the company during the third quarter of on september   we amended the merger agreement and the escrow agreement to extend the term of the escrow agreement until the later of the full distribution of the escrow funds or the final resolution of the agreed contingency 
the final resolution of the tax litigation or potential settlement will result in a total refund from the taxing authority to us of approximately million as of december   and of any such refund would in turn be payable to the holders of the cvrs 
as of december   we have recorded half of the expected refund  approximately million  as a component of the cvr liability related to this agreed upon contingency 
the court of appeals in michigan also ruled our favor on two other tax matters that will result in a refund of million  plus statutory interest 
these tax refunds will be retained by the company and are not subject to payment to the holders of the cvrs 
other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  includes a gain of million related to these expected refunds  which are also included in tax receivables in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  recently issued financial accounting standards information regarding recently issued accounting standards is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this annual report on form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in february  we closed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of notes fixed rate due and entered into a new million asset backed revolving credit facility 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay in full outstanding indebtedness under the secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes that existed as of december  we have no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  which is our only variable interest debt 
therefore  as of december  we have no material interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk we do not have material exposure to changes in foreign currency rates 
as of december   we do not have any outstanding foreign currency forwards or option contracts
