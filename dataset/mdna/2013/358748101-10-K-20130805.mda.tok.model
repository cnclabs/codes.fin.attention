at the beginning of fiscal year  the company operated a second business segment  which consisted of grill buffet style golden corral restaurants that were licensed to the company by golden corral corporation gcc 
the company closed six of the golden corral restaurants in august due to issues with under performance  which resulted in a pretax charge of  for impairment of long lived assets that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year additional non cash pretax impairment charges associated with the six restaurant closings in august were subsequently recorded during fiscal year a  in the third quarter of fiscal based on a contract that was accepted on one of the properties that was less than the original estimate of its fair value and b  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reflect revised opinions of value on the remaining properties  which had been received from real estate brokers 
in may  the remaining golden corrals were sold to gcc for million before closing adjustments  which resulted in a pretax loss of  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year results for the golden corral segment are now reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements

sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of frisch big boy restaurants 
sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to frisch big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators and the sale of frisch signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur as new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed 
below is the detail of consolidated sales fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in thousands frisch big boy restaurants operated by the company wholesale sales to licensees wholesale sales to groceries total sales a breakdown of changes in frisch big boy same store sales by quarter follows same store sales changes st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year fiscal year fiscal year the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  implemented respectively near the ends of the third quarters of fiscal years  and the first quarters of fiscal years  and included average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
another increase is currently being planned for implementation in the first quarter of fiscal year september 
customer counts in same stores were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year while higher menu prices may contribute to the overall trend in lower customer traffic  management believes larger factors are the chronically high unemployment rate in the midwest and the persistency of high gasoline prices  both of which continue to restrict the disposable income of the customer base  which in turn limits sales growth opportunities

the payment card industry security standards council pci has a data security standard with which all organizations that process card payments must comply 
the standard is intended to prevent credit card fraud by focusing on the internal controls of processing and storing such data 
pci requires an annual audit to certify the company compliance with the required internal controls 
the company received its attestations of compliance in june  june and again in june a finding of non compliance could restrict the company from accepting credit and debit cards as a form of payment 
plans to significantly expand the company grocery line business were delayed in fiscal year revamped plans are being developed to add frisch brand of salad dressings in grocery stores  joining frisch brand tartar sauce  which has been a long standing staple on grocery store shelves in ohio  kentucky and indiana 
since big boy is no longer branded on labels  the new frisch brand may now enter previously restricted markets 
gross profit the determination of gross profit is shown with operating percentages in the following table 
the table is intended to supplement the cost of sales discussion that follows 
cost of sales is comprised of food and paper costs  payroll and related costs  and other operating costs 
fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit the cost of food remains at all time highs 
according to a recent report from the national restaurant association  restaurant owners have experienced a percent increase in food costs over the last six years 
hamburger and bacon have the greatest consumption of all items in the company menu mix 
the price of hamburger continues at record highs driven by a the high cost of corn  which is the primary feed ingredient for cattle  hogs and poultry  and b record low beef supplies and strong demand for exports 
the us corn supply was weakened in the summer of by drought conditions in the nation corn belt and the continuation of federal energy policies that divert sizable portions of the domestic crop to energy production rather than to the nation food supply 
corn prices are expected to remain volatile through the summer of a forecast from the united states department of agriculture projects some relief from high corn prices in beef prices had moderated somewhat after hitting record high prices in the early part of the summer of  but by mid autumn had again begun to increase steadily  peaking in april  before retreating slightly 
although the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity prices  purchase contracts for some commodities may contain provisions that limit the price the company will pay 
in addition  the effect of commodity price increases is actively managed with changes to the menu mix  together with periodic increases in menu prices 
however  rapid escalations in the cost of food can be problematic to effective menu management  as evidenced by the three year trend in the above table despite higher prices being charged to customers 
food safety poses a major risk to the company 
management rigorously emphasizes and enforces established food safety policies in all of the company s restaurants and in its commissary and food manufacturing plant 
these policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of governmental authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to be certified in servsafe training and are required to be re certified every five years 

table of contents the across the board decreases in payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales shown in the above table were driven primarily by the combination of higher menu prices charged to customers and a reduction in labor hours commensurate with lower customer counts 
in fiscal year  payroll and related costs received the benefit from the federal hiring incentives to restore employment act of hire act  enacted march under which the company did not have to pay the employer s share of social security fica taxes on certain new hires 
fica credits under the hire act amounted to  during fiscal year notwithstanding the improvements shown in payroll and related cost percentages in the above table  payroll and related costs continue to be adversely affected by mandated increases in the minimum wage in ohio  where roughly two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred  the minimum wage for non tipped employees was increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was subsequently increased to per hour on january   to per hour on january  there was no increase on january   to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  on january   the rate increased to per hour  which represents a percent increase since the ohio minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was subsequently increased to per hour on january   to per hour on january  there was no increase on january   to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  on january   the rate increased to per hour  which represents an percent increase since federal minimum wage statutes currently apply to substantially all other non ohio employees 
the federal minimum wage for non tipped employees increased from per hour to per hour in july it was increased to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees non ohio was not affected by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees has always been managed closely according to sales patterns in individual restaurants 
however  the effects of paying the mandated higher hourly rates of pay have been and are continuing to be countered through the combination of reductions in the number of scheduled labor hours and higher menu prices charged to customers 
without benefit of reductions in labor hours  the ohio minimum wage increase on january  would have added an estimated  to annual payroll costs in ohio restaurant operations  and the increase on january  would add approximately  if there were to be no further schedule reductions in labor hours 
other factors also continue to have an adverse effect on payroll and related costs 
these factors include higher costs associated with benefit programs sponsored by the company  including medical insurance premiums and pension related costs 
although medical insurance rates remain at all time highs  rates for the calendar plan year remained the same as the rates for the calendar plan year 
actual costs for the calendar plan year are projected to be approximately  slightly lower than calendar plan year  the result of fewer enrollees in the program 
the company has typically absorbed percent of the cost for medical premiums  with employees contributing the remaining percent 
management continues to analyze and evaluate health care reform legislation the federal patient protection and affordable care act  enacted march to determine the future short and long term effects upon the company  while developing various strategies to mitigate the expected financial burden of compliance with the mandate when it becomes fully effective on january  in july  the u 
s 
treasury department announced that this provision had been postponed until january  among other responses  it is likely that employees will be contributing more than percent of premium cost and benefit design changes may be implemented 
net periodic pension cost including amounts charged to discontinued operations was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the higher net periodic pension expense for fiscal year was driven by a lower discount rate of basis points and the negative actual return on plan assets that was experienced in fiscal year net periodic pension expense for fiscal year received a benefit in excess of  from changes in assumptions relating to retirement  termination and marriage 
fiscal year s net periodic pension cost also included the effect of a curtailment credit of  from the termination of golden corral employees and a settlement loss of  no settlement losses were incurred in fiscal years or settlement losses are triggered when the sum of all settlements lump sum cash outs exceed interest and service cost 
no settlement losses are currently expected in fiscal year the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in each of fiscal years  and the assumption will be lowered to percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year  which will add an estimated  to net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension 
table of contents costs was percent in fiscal year  which was lowered from percent in fiscal year and from percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be increased to percent  which will subtract an estimated  from net periodic pension cost 
the rate of compensation increase used to calculate pension costs was percent in each of fiscal years  and  and will remain at percent for fiscal year 
net periodic pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at approximately  the primary drivers of the percent decrease from fiscal year are the higher discount rate and a much higher actual return on plan assets that was experienced during fiscal year contributions made to company sponsored plans were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and contributions for fiscal year are currently anticipated to be at least  which includes amounts to meet minimum legal funding requirements and potential discretionary contributions 
future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments that are held in trusts that have been established for the defined benefit pension plan 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plan assets 
the fair value of all the plan assets was   and  respectively at the end of fiscal years  and although equity markets have since made significant rebounds  the market declines experienced in  when the fair value of plan assets was lowered to  from  at the end of the previous year  continue to adversely affect funding requirements 
pension accounting standards require the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans to be recognized as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations pbo 
underfunded status at may  decreased to  fair value of plan assets  versus pbo of  from  fair value of plan assets  versus pbo of  at may  the pbo as of may  and may  includes former golden corral employees measured at accumulated benefit obligation no projections for future salary increases or additional years of credited service 
the company s equity was increased  net of tax  at may  to establish underfunded status at  the increase in equity was effected through a credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
equity was decreased  net of tax  to establish underfunded status of  at may   which was effected through a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its ohio workers compensation program 
initial self insurance reserves are accrued based on prior claims history  including an amount developed for incurred but unreported claims 
active management of claims  which includes a requirement for post accident drug testing  keeps the number of claims and the average cost per claim to a minimum 
other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  abandonment losses  property tax  insurance and utilities  plus costs relating to field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  new restaurant opening costs  and many other restaurant operating costs 
opening costs can have a significant effect on the operating costs 
opening costs in fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
as most of the other typical expenses charged to other operating costs tend to be more fixed in nature  the percentages shown in the above table can be greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
in other words  percentages will generally rise when sales decrease and percentages will generally decrease when sales increase 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while the line item for franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses from the sale of real property if any are then respectively added or subtracted 
charges for impairment of assets if any are also subtracted from gross profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs  which was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of sales on advertising and marketing 
all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the chief executive officer s ceo incentive compensation was included in other administrative costs as follows  zero and  respectively was accrued in fiscal years  and other administrative costs for fiscal year also benefited from the resignation of the chief operating officer coo in september  who is not being replaced 
stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and stock based compensation cost for fiscal year included  for an unrestricted stock award to the ceo 
the unrestricted stock award was granted in exchange for the ceo termination of an option to purchase  shares of the company common stock 

table of contents revenue from franchise fees is based upon sales volumes generated by frisch big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of may   frisch big boy restaurants were licensed to other operators and paying franchise fees to the company 
no licensed frisch big boy restaurants opened or closed during any of the periods presented in this md a 
other revenue also includes certain other fees earned from frisch big boy restaurants licensed to others along with minor amounts of rent and investment income 
gains and losses from the sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that routinely arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life  abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
losses from the sales of real property amounted to  in fiscal year the losses were from the sales of two former frisch big boy restaurants for which previous charges for impairment of assets totaled   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year and one of the golden corral restaurants that had closed in august for which previous charges for impairment of assets totaled  in fiscal year reported in discontinued operations 
proceeds from the sales of the three former restaurants amounted to  in fiscal year gains from sales of real property in fiscal year amounted to  primarily from the february sale of a former frisch big boy restaurant 
sales proceeds in fiscal year were  losses from sales involving real property in fiscal year amounted to  primarily from the march sale of certain surplus property 
total sale proceeds in fiscal year were  impairment of assets charges in fiscal year amounted to  reflecting the continuation of soft local market conditions  the impairment charges consisted of  to lower the fair values of the three former golden corral restaurants that had closed in august  which remain to be sold as of may   and  to lower the fair values of three former frisch big boy restaurants two of which were sold in fiscal year see preceding paragraphs 
impairment of assets charges in fiscal year amounted to  which included a charge of  associated with one under performing frisch big boy restaurant that was permanently closed near the end of fiscal year which was sold in fiscal year see preceding paragraphs  and  to lower the previous estimates of the fair values of two former frisch big boy restaurants that had been held for sale for several years one of which was sold in fiscal year see preceding paragraphs 
no charges for impairment of assets were recorded during fiscal year interest expense interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreases are primarily the result of lower debt levels 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
these credits are generally more favorable to the effective tax rate when lower levels of pretax earnings are experienced  as occurred in fiscal year tax returns that the company files in indiana and kentucky have net operating losses nol from prior periods to which the application of statutory tax rates results in a total tax benefit of approximately  however  a percent valuation allowance va was applied to these nol in fiscal year  as management believes that it is more likely than not that the total tax benefit will not be realized 
fiscal year included nol that resulted in tax benefits totaling  of which a va was applied to  while  was recognized in the provision for income tax expense in fiscal year management periodically assesses the likelihood of realization of net deferred tax assets based on historical  current and future expected operating results 
a va is recorded if management believes the company net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management monitors the realization of valuation allowances and may consider their release in the future based on any positive evidence that may become available 
the company believes it has no uncertain tax positions that have been filed or that are expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of the company s tax return for fiscal year in november 
table of contents the examination resulted in no changes 
the irs is currently examining the company tax return for fiscal year  which was filed in february discontinued operations on may   the company closed on the sale of its golden corral restaurant operations to golden corral corporation  from which the company had previously been granted licenses to operate the restaurants that comprised the assets that were sold in the transaction 
the company recorded a pretax loss on the sale of   in the fourth quarter during fiscal year the company had previously closed six under preforming golden corral restaurants in august  which resulted in a non cash pretax asset impairment charge with related closing costs of  that was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year ended september  
the impairment charge lowered the carrying values of the six restaurant properties to their estimated fair values 
additional non cash pretax impairment charges of  were subsequently recorded during fiscal year  in the third quarter ended march  based on a contract that was accepted for less than the original estimate of fair value  and  in the fourth quarter to reflect revised opinions of value from real estate brokers 
results of discontinued operations are shown in the following table fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year weeks weeks in thousands sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs gross profit administrative and advertising gain loss on sale of assets loss on sale of golden corral impairment of long lived assets loss earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes income taxes loss earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax liquidity and capital resources sources of funds food sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are available immediately for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in currency or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and remodeling costs  capital stock repurchases and dividends 

table of contents working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  which is a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are provided consistently by operations and credit lines remain readily available  this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 
aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands total year year year year year more than years long term debt interest on long term debt estimated rent due under capital lease obligations rent due under operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations operating leases may include option periods yet to be exercised  when exercise is determined to be reasonably assured 
consists primarily of commitments for certain food and beverage items  plus capital projects including commitments to purchase real property  if any 
does not include agreements that can be canceled without penalty 
deferred compensation liability undiscounted 
the company working capital deficit was  as of may   which included  invested in commercial paper 
working capital at may  was  including  invested in commercial paper  which was from the proceeds of the may sale of golden corral restaurants 
the  in commercial paper was converted to cash on september  to fund a special dividend of per share see financing activities below 
also as of may   the sum of  restricted cash principally from the golden corral sale proceeds was being held by a third party intermediary in anticipation of completing qualifying like kind exchanges in order to defer taxable gains pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
in july and august  all of the restricted cash was returned to the company treasury from the third party intermediary because suitable like kind exchanges could not be identified 
a financing package of unsecured credit facilities has been in place for many years with the same lending institution  currently styled since april as the loan agreement 
the following amounts are readily available to be borrowed at any time through october  construction loan  currently available revolving loan  currently available to fund temporary working capital the company expects to encounter no difficulties in extending the loan agreement before it expires on october  the company is in full compliance with the covenants contained in the loan agreement 
operating activities net cash provided by continuing operations was  in fiscal year  which compares with  in fiscal year and  fiscal year management measures cash flows from continuing operations by simply adding back certain non cash expenses to earnings from continuing operations  which has the effect of excluding normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories  accounts payable and accrued  prepaid and deferred income taxes  all of which can and often do fluctuate widely from year to year 
these non cash expenses include items such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets if any  stock based compensation costs and pension costs in excess of plan contributions 
the result of this approach is shown as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year an automatic change in accounting method was filed with the internal revenue service irs in fiscal year  to allow immediate deduction of certain repairs and maintenance costs  replacing the previous treatment that had capitalized these costs 

table of contents in december  the irs issued new temporary and proposed regulations on tangible property that significantly departs from the prior proposed regulations on which the company change in accounting method was based 
in november  the irs issued notice alerting taxpayers that final regulations regarding repairs would be released in the final regulations are expected to be effective for the company fiscal year june  to june  
the company will comply with the final regulations once issued by the irs 
net cash provided by discontinued operations in fiscal year was determined as follows normal changes in assets and liabilities plus certain non cash expenses  such as depreciation  the loss on the sale of restaurants net of the gain on the sale of other properties  and charges for the impairment of long lived assets  were added back to the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the same basic formula was used for fiscal year investing activities capital spending is normally the principal component of the company s investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year down slightly from  in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year

other information two new frisch big boy restaurants opened for business during fiscal year the first opened in august on land that was acquired in fee simple title in april the other new frisch big boy restaurant opened in march on ground that is leased to the company 
no construction of any new frisch big boy restaurants was in progress as of may  construction was begun in june on land in lexington  kentucky shortly after the land was acquired in fee simple title in june several other sites owned by the company have been land banked for possible future development 

table of contents including land and land improvements  the cost required to build and equip each new frisch big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  both of which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
costs also depend on whether new restaurants are constructed using plans for the original building prototype  square feet with seating for guests or its smaller adaptation  the building prototype  square feet with seating for guests  which is used in smaller trade areas 
the smaller building prototype plan was used to construct both of the new frisch big boy restaurants that opened during fiscal year the larger building prototype is being used to build the frisch big boy restaurant in lexington  kentucky that is expected to open in december approximately one fifth of the frisch big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with that of newly constructed restaurants 
the current average cost to renovate a frisch big boy restaurant ranges from  to  depending on age and other factors 
the fiscal year remodeling budget is  for planned remodel jobs 
certain high volume restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether an expansion of the dining room is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to  one restaurant is scheduled to receive a dining room expansion and a third cook line added to its kitchen in fiscal year part of the company s strategic plan entails owning the land on which it builds new restaurants 
however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
as of may   frisch big boy restaurants were in operation on non owned premises one capital lease and operating leases 
the count of restaurants on non owned premises includes one new frisch big boy restaurant that opened in march on land that is leased operating lease to the company  bringing to six the number of frisch big boy restaurants that have opened since on leased land 
the company remains contingently liable under certain ground lease agreements relating to land on which seven of the company former golden corral restaurants are situated 
the seven leases were assigned to golden corral corporation gcc as part of the may transaction to sell the restaurants to gcc 
the amount remaining under contingent lease obligations totaled  as of may   for which the aggregate average annual lease payments approximate  in each of the next five years 
since there is no reason to believe that gcc is likely to default  no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for amounts that would be payable by the company 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes the following to be the company s critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for protection against individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  management reviews claims valued by the third party administrator tpa of the program and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  management reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement and other factors that might provide guidance in the determining the expected values of individual claims 
in addition  an actuarial consulting company was engaged to provide an independent estimate of the company required unpaid loss and allocated loss adjustment expense for accidents occurring from the inception of the company self insurance program through the may  evaluation date 
as the expected value estimates provided by the actuarial consulting firm are developed over the range of reasonably possible as opposed to all conceivable outcomes  unexpected case developments could result in actual costs differing materially from estimated values presently carried in the self insurance reserves 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term investment return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
a committee 
table of contents consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee considers a weighted average of the historical broad market return and the forward looking expected return 
returns are developed based on the plan target asset allocation percent domestic equity  percent fixed income and percent cash 
the model to develop the historical broad market return assumes the widest period of historical data available for each asset class as early as in some cases through 
domestic equity securities are allocated equally between large cap and small cap funds  with fixed income securities allocated equally between long term corporate government bonds and intermediate term government bonds 
the model for the forward looking expected return uses a range of expected outcomes over a number of years based on the plan asset allocation as noted above and assumptions about the return  variance  and co variance for each asset class 
the historical and forward looking returns are adjusted to reflect a percent investment expense assumption representative of passive investments 
the weighted average of the historical broad market return and the forward looking expected return is rounded to the level of the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is selected by matching the cash flows of the pension plan to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the discount rate represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market aa yield curve above mean yield curve as developed by the company actuarial consulting firm beginning with the may  measurement date 
the yield curve is used to set the discount rate assumption using cash flows on an aggregate basis  which is then rounded to the level of the nearest basis points 
pension plan assets are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
poor performance in equity securities markets can significantly lower the market values of the investment portfolios  which  in turn  can result in a material increases in future funding requirements  b much higher net periodic pension costs to be recognized in future years  and c increases in underfunded plan status  requiring the company s equity to be reduced 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which carrying values exceed fair value  which is determined as either the greater of the net present value of the future cash flow stream  or by opinions of value provided by real estate brokers and or management judgment as developed through its experience in disposing of unprofitable restaurant operations 
broker opinions of value and the judgment of management consider various factors in their fair value estimates such as the sales of comparable area properties  general economic conditions in the area  physical condition and location of the subject property  and general real estate activity in the local market 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor operating performance 
the ultimate loss can be significantly different from the original impairment charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of fair values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on management estimate of federal  state and local tax liabilities 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  the application of statutory federal  state and local rates to estimated taxable income  and the effect of tax credits such as the federal credits allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the work opportunity tax credit wotc 
all tax returns are timely filed and are subject to audit by all levels of taxing authority 
audits can result in a different interpretation of tax laws from that of management 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense between financial reporting and tax statutes 
deferred tax accounting requires management to evaluate deferred tax assets  including net operating 
table of contents loss carry forwards  to determine whether these assets will more likely than not be realized on a future tax return 
these evaluations entail projections that require considerable judgment and are ultimately subject to future changes in tax laws including changes in tax rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk conditions in the financial and commodity markets are subject to change at any time  the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates  or will be converted to fixed rate term loans in the next six months 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of days or less 
cash may be in excess of fdic limits 
the company does not use any foreign currency in its operations 
operations are vertically integrated  using centralized purchasing and food preparation  provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
management believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and creates efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside of management control  including import and export restrictions  the influence of currency markets relative to the us dollar  the effects of supply versus demand  production levels and the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fresh produce  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing
