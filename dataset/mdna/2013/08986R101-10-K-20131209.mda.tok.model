critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future 
amounts recognized in our financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty 
accordingly  the amounts currently reflected in our financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of i biglari holdings inc  ii the wholly and majority owned subsidiaries of biglari holdings inc in which control can be exercised and iii limited partnership investment entities in which we have a controlling interest as the general partner 
in evaluating whether we have a controlling interest in entities in which we would consolidate  we consider the following for voting interest entities  we consolidate those entities in which we own a majority of the voting interests  and for limited partnership entities  we consolidate those entities if we are the general partner of such entities and for which no substantive removal rights exist 
the analysis as to whether to consolidate an entity is subject to a significant amount of judgment 
some of the criteria considered include the determination as to the degree of control over an entity by its various equity holders and the design of the entity 
before the sale of biglari capital and liquidation of western acquisitions  lp  the company consolidated its affiliated partnerships in its consolidated financial statements  which included the accounts of i the company  ii its wholly owned subsidiaries biglari capital  steak n shake  and western  and iii the lion fund and western acquisitions  lp the consolidated affiliated partnerships  in which the company had a substantive controlling interest 
as a result of the sale of biglari capital and the related liquidation of western acquisitions  lp  the company has ceased to have a controlling interest in the consolidated affiliated partnerships  which  accordingly  will no longer be consolidated in the company s financial statements 
beginning july   the consolidated financial statements only include the accounts of i the company and ii its wholly owned subsidiaries steak n shake and western 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
prior to july  the consolidated affiliated partnerships assets and liabilities were consolidated on the consolidated balance sheet even though outside limited partners had majority ownership in the consolidated affiliated partnerships 
the company did not guarantee any of the liabilities of its subsidiaries that were serving as general partners to these consolidated affiliated partnerships 
beginning july   our interests in the investment partnerships are accounted as equity method investments because of our retained limited partner interest in the investment partnerships 
the company records gains from investment partnerships inclusive of the investment partnerships unrealized gains and losses on their securities in the consolidated statement of earnings based on our proportional ownership interest in the investment partnerships 
long lived assets impairment and classification as held for sale we review company operated restaurants for impairment on a restaurant by restaurant basis when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
we test for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the total estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss is recognized in earnings 
the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset requires significant judgment regarding future performance of the asset  fair market value if the asset were to be sold  and other financial and economic assumptions 
we sell restaurants that have been closed due to underperformance 
we classify an asset as held for sale in the period during which each of the following conditions is met a management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  b the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  c an active search for a buyer has been initiated  d completion of the sale of the asset within one year is probable  e the asset is being marketed at a reasonable price  and f no significant changes to the plan of sale are expected 
there is judgment involved in estimating the timing of completing the sale of an asset 
insurance reserves we currently self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  directors and officers liability  and auto liability insurance programs 
for certain programs  we purchase reinsurance for individual and aggregate claims that exceed predetermined limits 
we record a liability for all unresolved claims and our estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr claims at the anticipated cost to us 
the liability estimate is based on information received from insurance companies  combined with management s judgments regarding frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  and settlement practices 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert a claim  and therefore the degree to which injuries have been incurred and the related costs have not yet been determined 
additionally  estimates about future costs involve significant judgment regarding legislation  case jurisdictions  and other matters 
we self insure our group health insurance risk 
we record a liability for our group health insurance for all applied claims and our estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimate is based on information received from our insurance company and claims processing practices 
our reserves for self insured liabilities at september  and september  were  and  respectively 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record deferred tax assets to the extent we believe there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior to their expiration 
to the extent deferred tax assets would be unable to be utilized  we would record a valuation allowance against the unrealizable amount and record that amount as a charge against earnings 
due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
we must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currently recorded 
based on results  a change of one percentage point in the annual effective tax rate would have an impact of  on net earnings 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess goodwill and any indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the required analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step approach 
the first step is the estimation of fair value of each reporting unit 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information included in our determination of fair value require significant management judgments 
we use both market and income approaches to derive fair value 
the judgments in these two approaches include  but are not limited to  comparable market multiples  long term projections of future financial performance  and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
leases restaurant operations leases certain properties under operating leases 
many of these lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
rent expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods when failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
we use a time period for straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the rent commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when they become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when they take access to the grounds for build out 
accounting for leases involves significant management judgment
